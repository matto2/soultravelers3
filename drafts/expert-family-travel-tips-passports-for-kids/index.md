](https://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a9507883302942fad5700200c-pi)Are you planning on traveling with children, but aren’t sure where to begin? After 10 years of world travel with a kid & roadschooling, we’ve learned a lot about traveling as a family and what family world travel takes. Our daughter, singer/songwriter & actress is a rarity with already having 4 passports at just 21 and she got her first passport at only five! As we go through our vintage camper in Barcelona, I've been so amazed at how much we accomplished with our family travel & worldschooling  & language learning goals, so will do a whole series of posts about expert family travel tips!

 It’s not intended to convince you one way or another on your vaccination decision, as I **believe it is up to each parent to research the issue and choose what is right for them.**   
Every study of non-vaccinating parents shows that they are likely to be college-educated with “above average” salaries and steady jobs  
  
When parents choose not to vaccinate their children, they take responsibility for their child's health. This means they need to protect their child's health in other ways — by feeding an excellent, nutrient-dense diet, extended breastfeeding, using herbs or other alternative medicine when necessary, etc. Some parents do choose not to vaccinate and don't take these steps. Most, however, take this responsibility very seriously. Children can and will still catch illnesses, but they won't be at risk for serious complications. Complications aren't magical; they don't just occur "just because." They occur because a child's health isn't optimal, usually because they are deficient in fat-soluble vitamins or have poor gut health. This is why parents who take care to prevent these deficiencies and feed their children well do not have to worry that their children will suffer anything serious.

look at the percentages of fully vaccinated people contracting these illnesses during the ‘outbreaks.’ Getting vaccinated does not mean you will not contract the disease.  
  

Vaccinating our children is a PERSONAL choice. One which any parent who asks you is wanting to do so out of CONCERN and willingness to weigh all the options before making a choice.

Travelling with kids is also a personal choice, and one that the parents have taken much into consideration of where, when, and why they want to go.. and the expenses etc.  
  
Make INFORMED decisions. That is what your readers were asking you for.. to help them make their decision informed. They ARE taking the responsibility  
  
you and only you can make that decision. I am Read, research, question, READ BETWEEN THE LINES and trust your instincts. Your kids are depending on you fir it. As Goethe said, there is nothing more terrifying than ignorance in action.

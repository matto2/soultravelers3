The people of China are it's true treasure and we've been very touched and blown away by the outstanding hospitality from the generous people of China.  
  
We've been very lucky in this first trip to China, thanks to my friend Winser Zao from China Travel 2.0 who I met through Elliott Ng on Twitter, to have had some amazing connections with locals through friends of friends of friends of friends etc.  
  
We have many heart warming stories to tell and it's enriched our travel in countless ways, but even the people on the street who speak no English, have been exceedingly kind in many small ways. People help us on buses or subways when we look a bit confused and use sign language to help.  
  
One lady helped me up some stairs in Beijing. In most cities I'd suspect she was looking to rob me, but she was just being kind for no reason.

We are moving away from the model in which learning is organized around stable, usually hierarchical institutions (schools, colleges, universities) that, for better and worse, have served as the main gateways to education and social mobility. Replacing that model is a new system in which learning is best conceived of as a flow, where learning resources are not scarce but widely available, opportunities for learning are abundant, and learners increasingly have the ability to autonomously dip into and out of continuous learning flows." To talk more about this new model, [we invited Gorbis to speak](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682274/join-us-to-hear-about-the-future-of-education) with _Fast Company_ senior writer Anya Kamenetz.

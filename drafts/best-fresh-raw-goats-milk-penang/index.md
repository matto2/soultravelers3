Looking for healthy raw goats milk in [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/where-to-buy-organic-food-in-penang.html "where to buy organic food penang")? This superfood which I make into nutritious [kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "goat milk kefir how to easy") and nourishing [kefir goat cheese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/how-to-make-diy-goat-cheese-with-kefir.html "how to make kefir goat cheese") as well as using the whey for many of my super [healthy lacto-fermented foods](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-salsa.html "lacto fermented salsa"), has been a staple in much of the world since Bibical times.  
  
Archeologists have found Sumerian tablets that are 6000 year old that explain how to ferment milk to prepare cheese. Even Ghandi restored his own health through drinking raw goats milk after fasting long periods.  
  
**GOATS MILK AND HEALTHY CHILDREN**  
  
 "Goat's milk is the most complete food known." - Journal of American Medicine  
  
One of the keys for [curing and preventing cavities and gum disease](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "curing gum disease and cavities") is drinking lots of raw milk and raw goats milk is the healthiest milk one can drink.  
  
"If you have kids, raw milk will not only help them grow, but will also boost their immune systems so they get sick less often. And, since the cream in raw milk is an important source of brain-building fats, whole milk and other raw dairy products will also help them to learn." Dr. Cate Shanahan M.D.

**IS RAW MILK SAFE?**  
  
Is it [safe](http://www.realmilk.com/safety/safety-of-raw-milk/ "SAFETY OF RAW MILK")? Like most people I didn't [eat raw eggs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raw-eggs-healthy-or-not.html "eat raw eggs") (smoothies/ [juicing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/juicing-and-health.html "green juicing")) or [raw milk](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/08/31/us-government-data-proves-that-raw-milk-is-safe.aspx "RAW MILK") and had irrational fears about them, until a doctor suggested I try them during my [health journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy food and travel") and doing so made a huge difference and improvement in my [health](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "TRAVEL AND HEALTH").  
  
Before trying them I did lots of [research on raw milk](http://drcate.com/raw-milk-why-mess-with-udder-perfection/ "RESEARCH ON BENEFITS OF RAW MILK") and it's [mind-boggling benefits](http://www.realmilk.com/health/milk-cure/ "milk cure benefits"), then started using it daily with my whole family and even 85 year old mother. We all benefitted, so we have continued. Many argue that the stainless steel tanks and other innovations in the dairy industry make pateurization unnecessary.  
  
“It is irresponsible for senior national government officials to oppose raw milk, claiming that it is inherently hazardous. There is no justification for opposing the sale of raw milk or warning against its inclusion in the diets of children and adults.” Dr. Ted Beals, M.D.  
  
"The risk of developing a serious illness (requiring hospitalization) from drinking unpasteurized milk is very low: **less than one in a million**". -Chris Klesser L.Ac  
  
"According to the US government's own data, you are about 35,000 times more likely to get sick from other foods than you are from raw milk. Between 1999 and 2010, there were only an average of 42 cases of illness per year attributed to raw milk. Meanwhile, an estimated total of 48 million foodborne illnesses occur each year from all foods." - Dr. Mercola D.0.

 **WHERE TO FIND SAFE, DELICIOUS, RAW MILK IN PENANG?**  
  
Email us through our ["contact us"](http://soultravelers3new.local/contact-us.html "conact us soultravelers3") page on this blog (click on that link) and I can give you the information about where and how to get this extremely scrumptious fresh goats milk in Penang.

**SO HAPPY TO FIND FRESH GOATS MILK IN PENANG**  
  
I had no trouble finding safe raw goats milk in California, or [raw milk](http://www.realmilk.com/health/raw-milk/ "raw milk") products in France, but I didn't trust most of the raw milk (goat or cows) in Malaysia because they have had some problems in the past and one must be extra careful with food issues and cleanliness in a developing-world nation (and every where today).  
  
EVERYTHING you put into your mouth has risks, but I feel much safer drinking this delicious fresh milk delivered cold to my door daily (about an hour after being milked), than eating ANY thing at the very [popular food hawker stands](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "food hawker stands penang") here. (I have gotten sick from the hawker stands and eating Indian food here and Mozart got [bad food poisoning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/penang-best-hospitals-great-health-care-at-low-cost.html "HOSPTIALS IN PENANG") from eating at her local school, so we don't do these things any more).  
  
**GOING TO THE GOAT FARM**  
  
[![Cute mama goat and baby relaxing at the clean farm](http://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a95078833017ee9c6da98970d-800wi "Cute mama goat and baby relaxing at the clean farm")](http://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a95078833017ee9c6da98970d-pi)  
  
The best way to really check out goat milk or any food product you buy, is to go to the farm, meet the farmer who also drinks the milk with  his family, inspect the milking equipment, hygiene, and ask many questions and check about test results.  
  
That is exactly what we did. This goat milk is made in a beautiful, clean, sustainable, eco-friendly farm with a very responsible and knowledgable owner with very contented animals and workers.  
  
[![Farm worker enjoys his work and the animals at the goat farm](http://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a95078833017d4252d727970c-800wi "Farm worker enjoys his work and the animals at the goat farm")](http://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a95078833017d4252d727970c-pi)**  
  
ECO-FRIENDLY, INNOVATIVE GOAT FARM**  
  
I am on a raw goats milk listserve of people who have raised and drunk raw goats milk for decades. These wise and very experienced folks gave me lots of good questions to ask the farmer and we've been back a few times. We found out what tests have been done on the goats and milk, how they handle the milking equipment etc., all about the breed of goats and more.  
  
The healthy goats are the Saanen breed, originally from Switzerland and imported from Austrailia. Unlike cow milk in stores, they get no growth hormones or antibiotics, so there is none in the milk.  
  
"Raw milk must come from a trusted source, from a dairy committed to cleanliness, protocol, and animal welfare." - Dr. Cate Shannahan M.D.

FRESH MEANS BETTER TASTE AND BETTER FOR HEALTH**  
  
I have tried many different brands of pasteurized goat milk in Penang, including some through the organic stores and the "goat man" that delivers to many expats. I thought that was the best I could do, so I made kefir out of it to get the most nutrition from it as pasteurized milk is "dead" milk with no value unless made into kefir.  
  
I could tell from the very first sip of this raw milk that it was a FAR SUPERIOR product as well as much better tasting. We've only been drinking it a few months and already see wonderful health results and will be writing more about this process. My homemade kefir and cheese is even more nutritious with raw milk and I do some with a raw milk and coconut milk combo.

"You want the animals to be eating fresh, growing grass because that’s their natural food and they will be healthier. Best of all, the milk will taste delicious and the cream to die for." Dr. Cate Shannahan M.D.

**BENEFITS OF RAW GOATS MILK**  
  
Raw milk is a living food, unlike pasteurized or UHT milk. Everyone should read Dr. Pottenger studies as he was one of the first to document the power of [epigenetics](http://www.foodrenegade.com/on-deep-nutrition-genetic-expression/ "epigenetics") and food. His studies also showed the advantage of fresh raw milk compared to the "dead" pasteurized milk that most buy in stores.  
  
According to Dr. Nemec M.D. , "baby cows who drank pasteurized milk died in 30 days",so no wonder it is  harmful to humans who drink it ( not to mention the harmful high level of hormones, antibiotics etc.).  
  
"Dr. Pottenger fed one group of cats a diet consisting of raw milk, raw meat and cod liver oil. Other groups were given pasteurized milk, evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk instead of raw milk. The results were conclusive and astounding. Those that ate raw milk and raw meat did well and lived long, happy, active lives free of any signs of degenerative disease. Those cats on pasteurized milk suffered from acute illnesses (vomiting, diarrhea) and succumbed to every degenerative disease now flourishing in our population, even though they were also getting raw meat and cod liver oil. By the 3rd generation a vast majority of the cats were infertile and exhibited “anti-social” behavior — in short, they were like modern Americans." - Dr. Thomas Cowan M.D.  
  
Raw goats milk is closest to human mother's milk,  boosts the immune system, is a natural anti-inflammatory, lower in fat and higher in good fatty acids, is less toxic than cow milk, anti-mucousa, has the potential to heal intestinal problems, cavities and much more.  
  
[![Got raw milk?](http://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a95078833017ee9c7f753970d-800wi "Got raw milk?")](http://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a95078833017ee9c7f753970d-pi)  
  
  
**WHY GOATS MILK?**  
  
Fully 72% percent of the world's population drink goats milk. Cow's milk requires almost a full 24 hours to be digested and it takes less than 20 minutes to digest goat's milk according to Dr. Sherilyn Renya.  
  
Goat milk provides 13% more calcium, 25% more Vitamin B-6, 47% more Vitamin A, 27% more selenium, 134% more potassium, and 350% more niacin than cow milk and is also higher in chloride, copper and manganese. Raw goat milk and raw cow milk is quite similar in composition with protein, vitamin C and Vitamin D on the same levels. Goat milk fat has 35% of the healing medium chain fatty acids compared to cow milk at 17%.  
  
“Raw milk cures many diseases” J.E. Crewe, MD. Founder of The Mayo Foundation  
  
  
**LACTOSE INTOLERANT? GOAT MILK!**  
  
Cow's milk is the most common food allergen in North America. Goat milk has 13% less lactose than cow milk and most people who are allergic to cow milk tend NOT to be allergeic to goat milk. Amazingly, 50% of people with lactose intolerance to cow’s milk find that they can easily digest goat’s milk, especially if it is raw.  
  
MANY have found a [cure for lactose intolerance](http://chriskresser.com/how-to-cure-lactose-intolerance "cure for lactose intolerance") and the [GAP diet](http://www.nourishingdays.com/2011/03/our-experience-with-the-gaps-diet-reversing-food-allergies-giveaway/ "GAPS diet reversing allergies") has helped many in this area, [reverse allergies](http://www.foodsmatter.com/blog/kefir-and-raw-milk/ "raw milk kefir"), even to milk. Some say after healing the gut with the GAPS diet, even the worst cases can start first with kefir in small quantities which helps re-populate the gut, so that in time they can enjoy endless amounts of raw goats milk. (I was tested as having "sensitivity" to cow milk, so switched to goat milk long ago).  
  
I know a majority here who are Chinese or Asian (often lactose intolerant types) who drink this raw milk and thrive on it, like my Korean neighbors who saw our delivery, so now gets their own every day!

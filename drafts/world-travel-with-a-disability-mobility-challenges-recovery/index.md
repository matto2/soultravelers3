That's a photo of me in a wheel chair in Melk hospital the day I left the hospital last August after [my bike wreck on the Danube](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html). Yes, it is possible to [travel the world as family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) with a young child long term [with mobility challenges, but it is a lot harder](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html). I really admire those who do not let challenges, even [severe physical challenges stop them from traveling.](http://wheelstraveler.blogspot.com/) If there is a will, there is always a way.

_"Life is a challenge, meet it"_ - Mother Theresa

I don't usually go into these details but decided it was important if it could help others. Not necessarily for  the extremely challenged, but those who have obstacles to their travel dreams. We're fifty-something with a young child, I'm overweight with some physical problems that have now increased, so we have had to learn some things about meeting challenges head on and I will be doing a series of posts about overcoming obstacles and dealing with health issues while traveling.

I've had [mobility challenges long before we began traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html)  on our [family world  tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) in 2006,  thanks to a bad break of my right femur and severe crushing of my right knee seventeen years ago, despite several surgeries. For many years, my knee use to regularly go out for months at a time, sometimes just by turning over in bed at night, so I've spent many months  in wheel chairs and crutches over the years. Funny, but my 82 year old mother has never broken a bone ,even despite having survived a car crash where her car left a dangerous high way and rolled down a  hill. Destiny has something different to teach each one of us.

My struggles with weight gain are tied into my mobility issues and add to the challenges. The last time it went out was when I was five months pregnant and was stuck immobilized on the floor in pain for many hours waiting in the dark for my husband to come home from work to discover and help me. I was too far from the phone to reach it.  Much to my surprise I was helped most with this structural, physical problem via alternative care after I had exhausted the medical and surgical route with the very best in that field. Knock on wood, that they seemed to have cured my knee from "going out" as it has not done that since I was pregnant. It remains weak though and [painful with much movement](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/11/bloody-monday-i.html#more).

I am thankful that I can walk now and grateful that I am not in a wheel chair or on crutches. I can walk, but it seems I will never be the same as pre-injury and this does affect our lives and our world travel, sometimes [making us more at risk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/11/bloody-monday-i.html#more). There are lots of great websites to help those who want to travel with disabilities:

**[\*Global Access](http://www.globalaccessnews.com/)

**[\*Access Able](http://www.access-able.com/)** 

**[\*Accessible Europe](http://www.accessibleurope.com/accessiblefrance/info_paris_accessible.htm)**

**[\*Disabled Travelers](http://www.disabledtravelers.com/)**

I haven't really used them much because I'm not in a wheel chair and I  do not think of myself as disabled. As most of you know, my right dominant arm was broken, a pin put in via surgery and that arm was fully paralyzed for 10 months. Many consider a broken arm as not a big deal, but adding a severely damaged nerve and paralysis to that has made it extremely hard and extremely painful. I'm sometimes amazed that we made it this far ( and the trip back to Spain from Austria via motorhome was daunting)  because despite the weekly physical therapy while in Spain, I've still got a long way to go. I still do not have full use back and this new right arm injury added to my old right leg injury, makes our traveling much more challenging. 

When we took our [little trip  to Gibraltar](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/rock-of-gibraltar-family-holiday-trip-guide-family-trave-tips-information-from-costa-del-sol-spain.html) I could see that it was going to be more challenging on the road with my new reality. We found a very protected environment and [winter home in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html) with almost no stairs ( almost impossible to do in a hill village). My right side is my dominant side, but now it is my weakest side, so my balance is greatly affected, especially on stairs and inclines. Just getting in and out of the motorhome or up into or out of our elevated  bed are much more risky undertakings for me now. 

I tend to like to look on the bright side though and it is certainly much easier than when we traveled by RV back to Spain, so we have already come a long way and do not have plans to stop. I am grateful to be on the road traveling again and grateful for all that we have each learned through this process. We have had to work as a strong team and our travel would not be possible without the hard work of DaVinci and Mozart who help me compensate for my weaknesses.

"Focused will is incredible. If you have a dream and you don't give up no matter what obstacles come up, then life's problems will fall away and you will get what you want. It happens. It works." - Yanni

I haven't written yet fully about our trip to London from  Melk and Vienna only a month or so after surgery. That was pretty crazy to do and DaVinci didn't think we should do it, but there were some dear friends there so I was highly motivated and knew I could also get some more healing while there. I was still not able to sleep at night due to pain from my injury ( which went on for many months much to my surprise and still affects my sleep eleven months la ter). Besides the pain, even simple things are very hard when one just has one left hand.Things like eating, putting on clothes, taking a shower, brushing your teeth become monumental tasks. One also becomes very vulnerable with an injury like this. I had planned on using the subway in London, but just the rush of people and stairs made it impossible in my weakened condition, even with help. We took taxi's and even that was a challenge getting in and out.

Here are keys that helped us most on this journey while injured:

**\*Call or email ahead to have someone take you by wheel chair onto plane and off**

**\*Also have them call head for wheel chair assistance with on and off on trains**

**\*Pack very light**

**\*Use Taxi's  
**

I  can not say enough on how these things helped. I've never asked for such care and I can honestly say that I doubt if we could have made it without their help. They even help you through security and on and off the plane with pre-boarding. Asking for help is important, especially if you have a severe injury like mine that is not obvious at first glance in  a crowd of people. Just walking around the airport was a scary feat at that point in my recovery as crowds in a hurry do not pay much attention to who they bump into and I was warned by my doctors  that another fall at this juncture could have killed me. Walking in a crowd fresh from a severe injury is a very different experience than when one is healthy. I managed to go on buses, trains and planes, but it was not easy and we could have not done it without help and as a well oiled team that was very focused and working together. Even while in a wheel chair in transit, Davinci and Mozart would walk in strategic ways next to my side  to protect me from people in the crowd who were unaware. Even minimal walking or sitting without proper support ( most public places) was difficult.

"_As soon as you truly commit to making something happen, the "how" will reveal itself_." Tony Robbins.

On the way from Austria to southern Spain by RV, we had to improvise a lot. We bought a stool and several pillows to help us. I had to find a new way back into the "home" part of the camper as I could not use the stairs nor could I use the upper bed. With the stool near the cab door and a lot of effort, I could get into and out of  my seat when we drove. We pulled that seat all the way down to help me enter the camper part backwards as I could not use the normal door due to the stairs. Obviously, I did not go in or out very often.

Even though our motorhome is just van sized, in theory it can sleep six people. We had never used the bed that the table area folds into and we mostly use the two bunk beds in back for storage. I could not climb up into the loft bed over the cab, so I had to sleep in the bed we would make out of the table area every night.

Thankfully, things are a lot better this time as I can use the bed and the stairs, but they are a lot more risky for me now. Most people do not realize that not having a decent right arm or right leg, nor a right hand that works fully yet, still affects everything I do. I still have numbness in my thumb and hand and some wrist issues. Things like cutting, cooking, opening bottles, writing, using a key etc still challenge me. We use the stool at the bottom of our outdoor stairs to help, now that I can pull myself in and out of the cab door when we drive. The mattress is quite hard so I'm having more pain, so we are going to look into finding a better mattress, which is probably something long overdue. 

We headed to Barcelona because we love it, but also because they have a great indoor pool, work out room, sauna and jacuzzi where I can continue to work on my healing. We will be traveling more slowly this summer as we work on continued healing as we roam. When I had my surgery for my arm in Austria, they gave me massive antibiotics intravenously which is pretty standard treatment for surgery, but in Spain I got really sick and we discovered that it gave me a very bad case of Candida internally and externally on my skin. Thus I have been on lots of vitamin therapies and a very restricted diet to resolve that which has impacted my digestion, pancreas, lungs, blood sugar and more. 

I have had absolutely no sugar since late February and very little carbs except fresh spinach, asparagus and zucchini. Trying to keep up with this regime on the road and with our tiny refrigerator adds to the challenge.The good news is I have lost over 40 pounds and plan to continue this kind of eating for some time as I plan on getting down to and maintaining my normal-sized  weight.

I have long known I was [sugar sensitive](http://www.radiantrecovery.com/newsensitive6.htm), ( I once lost 100 pounds and kept it off for many years easily by becoming aware of my sugar sensitivity) but now I have it very clear again,  just how bad it is for me and how much better I do when I eliminate it from my life. I'm not a person who craves sweets, nor do I eat much, but on the road we have had more ice cream and sometimes white flower products than what works for me. At the moment, my body is allergic to many things, but I'm learning to enjoy my limitations with  eating as much as I have with my limitations with clothes. Minimalism suits me in many ways.

We keep finding new ways to meet challenges and fun ways to handle them. DaVinci has also had some health challenges this winter and I will be doing some posts about health issues on the road and all of the great things and people  that we have discovered along the way. We are grateful to have some amazing doctors and practitioners that we can work with online and over the phone.

The blessing in all of this is we are more focused than ever on creating more health in our lives. In some ways it is harder on the road, but in some ways it is easier. The challenges to my arm, just like the [travel, is good for our brains](http://www.amenclinics.com/cybcyb/brain-health-club/new-ways-to-keep-your-brain-young/), as [brains thrive on change](http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010514/) and new things to learn keep you young. I would have never guessed in a million years that my left arm could become so strong. I am sure there must be some benefit to me that my left side ( arm and leg) has been forced to become so strong.

I don't write this for pity, but many come to our website unaware of the challenges or that I even had an accident. Some think of us as being on one big 4 year vacation, so  get hurt feelings because we can't always keep up with email, Twitter, responding to every comment, or Facebook. There are many who read our website, but only one of me to answer everything. We live a great life, but it is not without challenges. I can not give everything to the blog or writing books or there is nothing left for me and my family. Our life is at a slower pace due to the physical challenges, but also by just the many logistics of living a mobile travel lifestyle in many foreign lands and educating a child as we go. 

When we started our journey in 2006, my brother told me that we should not travel, but stay home and lose the weight. ( He also has a weight problem). It's a valid point. Many thought we were insane to sell our home. ( It was a booming market in 2005). Some thought we should live in one area until our child was grown and always live near relatives. Many think long term travel is only for young singles or old retirees.  When I landed in the hospital in Austria, they wondered why we did not go home to heal.  All valid points, but we saw it differently. 

"When you make choices different than the norm , normal people will question them" Maya Frost

Part of my point in sharing this is to show that you don't necessarily have to have things perfectly together in order to travel or live a dream. If I waited until I was thin enough, we were over flowing in money, we had no health concerns, Mozart had finished school etc, we probably would never leave...and we would have missed many blessings that have come our way these last four years. I have a friend who says the whole symbolism of Jesus born in a stable, is to remind us to start where we are, make the most of what we do have. I like that thought and try to remember that when I find myself challenged or in self doubt.

The only limits we have are those that we put on ourselves" Christopher Reeve

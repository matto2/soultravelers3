According to UK psychologist Dr Aric Sigman, by the time they’re seven years old the average child born today will have spent one full year of 24-hour days watching screen media. And he believes this over-exposure is leading to a generation of children who are developing a lifelong dependency on small screens.  
  
According to UK psychologist Dr Aric Sigman, by the time they’re seven years old the average child born today will have spent one full year of 24-hour days watching screen media. And he believes this over-exposure is leading to a generation of children who are developing a lifelong dependency on small screens.

Most worryingly, Dr Sigman says that playing computer games for so long could lead to long-term changes in the brain – changes that resemble the effects of substance dependence.

Michael Rich, director of Boston’s Center on Media and Child Health, says that the brain chemical dopamine, often associated with pleasure, is released when kids play games. Many apps are designed to encourage children to keep playing by offering rewards or exciting visuals at unpredictable times – which, Rich says, “gives a dopamine squirt".

That dopamine rush is the same effect triggered by playing the pokies, which we all know can lead to serious addiction and devastating consequences.

As a parent who has confiscated the iPad after too much use and then had to deal with the resulting meltdowns, I can attest that the addiction is already forming in my kids. So these findings had me fairly horrified.

Yet the worst was yet to come: I came across the _Newsweek_ article ‘[Is the web driving us mad?](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/08/is-the-internet-making-us-crazy-what-the-new-research-says.html)’

“The current incarnation of the internet ... may be making us not just dumber or lonelier but more depressed and anxious, prone to obsessive-compulsive and attention-deficit disorders, even outright psychotic.”

The article quotes some truly frightening research, including this: “Chinese researchers found ‘abnormal white matter’ – essentially extra nerve cells built for speed – in the areas charged with attention, control, and executive function. A parallel study found similar changes in the brains of videogame addicts.

“\[This came\] on the heels of other Chinese results that link internet addiction to ‘structural abnormalities in gray matter’, namely shrinkage of 10 to 20 percent in the area of the brain responsible for processing of speech, memory, motor control, emotion, sensory, and other information.”

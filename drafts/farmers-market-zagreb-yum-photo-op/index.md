Farmers Market Zagreb!  
Yum Photo Op!  

<!--more--> This is a central market behind the main square, settled near the Cathedral just like in the 19th century. It has been the city’s major trading place since 1926. Farmers (women are usually known as “kumice”) from surrounding villages offer a variety of homegrown fruit and vegetables or homemade cheese and cream. You can find butchers and fishmongers in the covered market below, downstairs. In front of it there is also a “flower market”. It also became a part of an international show “Food markets – In the Belly of the City” as the most famous market in Zagreb.

“...As to claims that vaccines have been the major factors in controlling infectious diseases of earlier times, according to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, from 1911 to 1935 the four leading causes of childhood deaths from infectious diseases in the USA were diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), scarlet fever, and measles. Yet, by 1945 the combined death rates from these causes had declined by 95 percent before implementation of mass vaccine programs. \[9\] Other sources provided much the same information. \[10-11\] Furthermore, according to a report in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, July 30, 1999, improvements in sanitation, water quality, hygiene, and the introduction of antibiotics have been the most important factors in control of infectious disease in the past century. Although vaccines were mentioned, they were not included among the major factors. \[12\]...” ~Dr. Harold Buttram, Catherine J Frompovich [http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2011/06/10/basics-of-the-human-immune-system-prior-to-introduction-of-vaccines-are-vaccines-turning-our-children](http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2011/06/10/basics-of-the-human-immune-system-prior-to-introduction-of-vaccines-are-vaccines-turning-our-children)’s-immune-systems-inside-out/  
  
"...Historically, health science supports the reality that: a) truly clean water which is free of harmful levels of all contaminants, b) sanitation, c) personal hygiene, d) adequate supplies of uncontaminated, healthy food, e) adequate non-toxic clothing f) adequate shelter from the elements, and g) freedom from war within the civilization have been, and still are, the keys to the survival, and flourishing of, human civilization for thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, depending on ones views on the history of humans on the Earth, before “vaccines” were developed. When any of these keys are removed, the health of the civilization was and is weakened, often fatally, as the fall of the Roman Empire clearly indicates. ~Paul King, PhD [http://dr-king.com/docs/120127\_FnlDrft\_RevuOfAutsmVaccneContrvrsyTheNeedForRespnsbleScienceJournlsm\_b.pdf](http://dr-king.com/docs/120127_FnlDrft_RevuOfAutsmVaccneContrvrsyTheNeedForRespnsbleScienceJournlsm_b.pdf)

We need to see the 100 or so years prior to the beginning of these graphs...as in the previous graph sets; the CDC has done this with all their graphs, giving the illusion of vaccine effectivness when there's so much more that's left out of their 'official' version of the vaccination story.  
Hep C, with the same decline in the absence of a vaccine

additional vaccination historical statistics:  
Non-Efficacy  
• FACT : In the Philippines, the largest smallpox epidemic occurred between 1917 and 1919, in which there were 162,503 cases and 71,453 deaths. All cases were vaccinated. 21  
• FACT : In England, smallpox vaccinations were made compulsory in 1853. Between 1863 and 1865, the population rose 7% and the death rate rose by 41%. Between 1870 and 1872, the population rose 9% and the death rate from smallpox rose 123%. 22  
• FACT : Following the introduction of compulsory immunisation, the incidence of diphtheria increased by 30% in France, 55% in Hungary, 200% in Switzerland and 625% in Germany. In Sweden, diphtheria virtually disappeared without immunisation. 23  
FACT : Germany began compulsory diphtheria vaccinations in 1939. After that country was thoroughly vaccinated, cases of the disease skyrocketed to 150,000. 24 France initially rejected diphtheria vaccinations because of the disasters she witnessed in other countries due to its use. But after the German occupation, France was forced into submitting to the shots. By 1943, cases of diphtheria in that country had soared to nearly 47,000. 25 At the same time in nearby Norway, which refused vaccinations, there were only 50 cases. 26 [http://www.missionislam.com/health/vaccinefacts.htm](http://www.missionislam.com/health/vaccinefacts.htm) (references indexed, please examine them for yourself; not my religion...I take accuracy from wherever I find it)

We have been to 46 countries on 5 continents with a kid who has never been vaccinated, never taken an antibiotic or even tylenol or cough syrup....never had a problem and she is a super healthy kid.  
  
We mostly homeschool, but dipped into local schools in China, Spain, Malaysia to help her become fluent in Mandarin and Spanish reading and writing and had no problem with our refusal to do any vaccines...even when they gave vaccines in the school to the kids.  
  
Just thought I'd answer [Jet Lee](https://www.facebook.com/evelyn.byrd.779) and [Jess Ica Yadira](https://www.facebook.com/ezrasmom) about our experience as we have been tr aveling the world non-stop for almost 9 years as a family.  
  
NEVER had any hurtles so far. This is a good article on this topic about vaccines and travel. [http://www.mothering.com/community/a/far-off-adventures](http://www.mothering.com/community/a/far-off-adventures)

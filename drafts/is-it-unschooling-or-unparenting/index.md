Is it Unschooling or Unparenting?  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

<!--more--> I am a huge fan of child led learning, time in nature, lots of time for play, but I find it sad when some parents, especially those who consider themselves part of the very cliquey "radical unschooling"  movement,  confuse unschoolig with unparenting.  
  
Recently my bright young friend Eli wrote a very honest post about the negative side of unschooling from radical unschoolers and the discussion was very enlightening.

The author quoted John Holt, so here's what Pat Farenga (a follower of John Holt) says regarding unschooling ... on the John Holt Growing Without Schooling website:  
  
Unschooling: "This is also known as interest driven, child-led, natural, organic, eclectic, or self-directed learning. Lately, the term "unschooling" has come to be associated with the type of homeschooling that doesn't use a fixed curriculum. When pressed, I define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn in the world, as their parents can comfortably bear."  
  
"Unschooling is not unparenting; freedom to learn is not license to do whatever you want. People find different ways and means to get comfortable with John Holt's ideas about children and learning and no one style of unschooling or parenting defines unschooling."

In early 2010, a spike in cases appeared at Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael, and it was soon determined to be an outbreak of whooping cough -- the largest seen in California in more than 50 years.

Witt had expected to see the illnesses center around unvaccinated kids, knowing they are more vulnerable to the disease.

"We started dissecting the data. What was very surprising was the majority of cases were in fully vaccinated children. That's what started catching our attention," said Witt.

To figure out just how well the vaccine was working, Witt and his colleagues collected information on every patient who had tested positive for pertussis between March and October, 2010.

Of the 132 patients under age 18, 81 percent were up to date on recommended whooping cough shots and eight percent had never been vaccinated. The other 11 percent had received at least one shot, but not the complete series.

"Unvaccinated children tended to be white, to have a mother who was married and had a college degree, to live in a household with an annual income exceeding $75 000, and to have parents who expressed concerns regarding the safety of vaccines and indicated that medical doctors have little influence over vaccination decisions for their children. Unvaccinated children were more likely to be male than female. Annually, ∼17 000 children were unvaccinated. The largest numbers of unvaccinated children lived in counties in California, Illinois, New York, Washington, Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Utah, and Michigan. States that allowed philosophical exemptions to laws mandating vaccinations for children as they entered school had significantly higher estimated rates of unvaccinated children." from study done by From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Immunization Program, Atlanta, Georgia  
  

In 1983, the Centers for Disease Control recommended a total of 10 vaccines for our children. In 2007, the CDC recommends 36, an increase of 260%. Yet, no studies have ever been done to compare neurological disorder ("ND") rates of unvaccinated children to vaccinated children. We commissioned a national market research firm to survey more than 13,000 children in California and Oregon. Read the results here.

Cal-Oregon Unvaccinated Survey

"We surveyed over 9,000 boys in California and Oregon and found that vaccinated boys had a 155% greater chance of having a neurological disorder like ADHD or autism than unvaccinated boys." -Generation Rescue, June 26, 2007

Vaccinating our children is a PERSONAL choice. One which any parent who asks you is wanting to do so out of CONCERN and willingness to weigh all the options before making a choice.

Travelling with kids is also a personal choice, and one that the parents have taken much into consideration of where, when, and why they want to go.. and the expenses etc.  
  
Make INFORMED decisions.

Check out a book by Dr. med. Gerhard Buchwald. ‘The Vaccination Nonsense’. (page 108)

In reply to Elizabeth’s link on the NY mumps outbreak, you state that the link at ://www.aapnj.org/showcontent.aspx?MenuID=1037 appears to suggest that this highly unusual mass resistance to vaccination occurs largely among Orthodox Jewish populations in Israel and NY/NJ and there might be hereditary factors. It’s also worth noticing that, unless vaccination rates in the population are below 77.3%, unvaccinated kids were \*still\* more likely to get the disease, despite what appears to be a case of community resistance. Well maybe i am missing something but it suggests nothing of the sort. It DOES, however say that there were a number of reports of mumps in individuals with no links to the Orthodox Jewish community.  
  
Have a look at this link ://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCT1D-6rR4c . Pletny more info out there is you go  
  
  
ou also discount anecdotal evidence in favour of quantitative data, which is only natural. However, qualitative research is something that is lsregly missing frlom the vaccination deabte. Have a look at [http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040301.html](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040301.html) for more info on the shortfalls of quantitavive research) Quantative studies boil a complex situation down to a single number that’s easy to grasp and discuss, whioch appeals to our human snese od logic, but when they are conducted on something as complex as vaccinations and the human immune system, all you are getting in the end is statements likke ‘… MAY be linked to… ’ ‘… is not THOUGHT to have caused….’ etc , frlom BOTH sides of the debate. The fact is there is NOT a lot of GENUINE hard and fast data as there are just too many variables (environment, diet, location, virus lifecycles, the lsit goes on) to many other variabkes to allow for a valid control group. For example, who is to say that small pox was elliminted by mass vaccination? Perhaps the disease was on the downturn anyway- think SARS, bird flu, swine flu. These were not (widely) vaccinated for but the epdidemic has passed (for now). Diseaeses and viruses come and go- has always has been and always will be the case.  
  
Finally, I Find it deplorable that people are actually asking Theodora (awesome as she is and all) whether or not they should vaccinate their kids for travel. Folks, you and only you can make that decision. I am Read, research, question, READ BETWEEN THE LINES and trust your instincts. Your kids are depending on you fir it. As Goethe said, there is nothing more terrifying than ignorance in action

What hurdles have you come across when traveling from country to country regarding vaccines? Are they mandatory in some countries? Is there exemptions available?

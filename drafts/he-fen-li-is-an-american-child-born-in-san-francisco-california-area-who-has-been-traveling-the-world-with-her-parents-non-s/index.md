He Fen Li is an American child born in San Francisco, California area who has been traveling the world with her parents non-stop for the last 7 years to educate her as a global citizen. We started our world trip when she was 5 and she just turned 12 last week.

She is a happy, out going child who loves to read, sing, make art and play and has a passion for world peace, people and sustainability/green issues. She plays the violin, piano and likes to compose songs. She is a Dragon in Chinese astrology and so is her mom, so it's exciting to first visit China together in a Dragon year.

We have been to 44 countries on 5 continents so far. We are monolingual parents, but wanted to raise her as a trilingual from birth in the world's dominant languages ( English, Spanish and Mandarin) as we feel one can not really understand a culture without knowing the language well. She wants to learn French next.

We ( Jeanne and Gary) are older parents, thus wanted more time together as a family, so took the risk to sell all our things to  retire  early to do this. We think experiences and time together are more important than things, so we live a simple life.

He Fen Li has been tested as a highly gifted child, so we have chosen a unique way to educate her. ( She walked and talked well at 6 months old in 2 languages, taught herself to read at 2, tested at a 3rd grade level  ( 9 years old) at 3 years old and 10th grade ( 16 years old) at 6 years and tested with top scores at Johns Hopkins University CTY gifted programs). She has done well in many John Hopkins University CTY classes online and in person and we plan to do the summer programs in Hong Kong next summer.

We are interested in coming to China because we have great interest in Chinese culture and Mandarin. He Fen Li is the youngest, smallest and only Caucasian in her 1000 kid Mandarin high school in Penang, so is use to being in an all Chinese environment.

 Reading Harry Potter at Cambridge University in England  
  
  
**February 2012 to November 2012**  
  
Currently a 7th grade student at Han Chiang High School ( a private Chinese high school in Penang, Malaysia) in their gifted class. She is pulled out for 2nd grade level Mandarin classes and top English class.  
  
**May 2011 to Feb 2012**  
  
Home educated during travel to Bhutan, Thailand, Jordan, Spain, Germany, Florida and California.  
  
**Nov 2010 to May 2011**  
  
Skipped from 4th grade in Spain to 7th grade in Penang at Han Chiang High School at 10, starting with their special class for foreign students.  
  
**May 2010 to Nov 2010**  
  
Homeschooled as we traveled in Barcelona, Granada, Provence, French Riviera, Paris, Malaga, London, New York City, San Francisco, Hawaii, Los Angeles, Tahiti, Bora Bora, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, and Penang.  
  
**Nov 2006 to May 2010**  
  
Started a pattern of 5 months in the winter at the local primary school in Andalusia, Spain and 7 months of travel homeschooling mostly around Europe extensively, but also with trips to Africa, the Sahara and Turkey.  
  
**September 2005 to June 2006**  
  
Early entrance to a 1st/2nd grade top  public school in California at 4 ( where all her classmates were 7,8 and 9) based on her abilities and the school had never done this before. Still problematic because her reading levels were far ahead of class mates, but her writing skills were a challenge due to age. Thus, we decided to "world school".  
  
**September 2004 to June 2005**  
  
Started Kindegarten at 3 ( usual age in USA is 6 as were most of her classmates, but they made an exception due to her abilities)  
  
**MUSIC**  
  
Started violin at 23 months old and piano at 3 and we've continued both as we travel the world as we can usually by webcam with teachers on other continents.

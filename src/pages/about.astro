		We are Soul Travelers 3 - a California family documenting our open-ended world journey.
		Through slow travel, we explore diverse cultures while homeschooling on the road,
		sharing insights on budget living, spiritual growth, and practical nomadic lifestyle tips.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our adventures have taken us to over 40 countries across Europe, Asia, Oceania, and beyond.
		We believe in meaningful travel that enriches the soul, educates the mind, and brings families closer together.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here you'll find our stories, photography, practical travel advice, and inspiration for
		families considering extended travel or alternative education approaches.

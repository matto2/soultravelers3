Mozart is happy that now we have our very own store! Well, not exactly, but we have decided to partner up with some first class affiliate stores because we have lots of experience using various products on our family world tour andÂ  know what has worked well for us.

Hopefully, this information will be useful to many of you and it will also be a way for us to possibly make a little money for all the work that we put into this website. You don't even have to travel to enjoy many of these items! When we started out we had no idea how much effort it would take to keep up with the 50,000 plus photos or thousands of stories that we have written on the blog as we travel. We want to continue to bring you great content and add even more, so having these stores will help us provide you with more quality goods and also ways to support us.

If you are planning to purchase ANYTHING from any of the stores we work with, please CLICK on the links below to get there. This is how it works, we receive a small percentage of the purchase price of anything you buy from that company (whether we have it advertised here or not).

Luckily, we have a great designer in the family, and we will be coming up with a lot of great products including T-shirts, artwork, and photos as we go. Look for those through our Cafepress and Image stores. It will be a fun, creative project for us and a way to share many of the great images and inspiration that touches us. Soon, we will even have an e-book with critical how-to information. When you are looking for a unique gift item, think of us!

Who wouldn't want to walk in the footsteps of the Master Painters? The South of France is a heady mix of art, exquisite restaurants, beaches, hiking, wine, Roman remains, sunshine and a perfect place to learn by doing. Since all three of us are artists who [love Van Gogh](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/van-gogh.html "van gogh") and [the Impressionists](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/3-museums-in-a.html "the impressionists in Europe"), it was a thrill to follow his footsteps and visit the places he painted [while in Arles](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/arles-france-vacation.html "visiting arles france").

Another example of [world schooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world schooling") at it's best and how travel teaches. Also in the [South of France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-southern-france-uzes-provence-near-pont-du-gard-photography-europe-window.html "south of france") we enjoyed walking the artists foodsteps in c[apitvating Colliore](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html "captivating Colliore beautiful french town")  , [Roman art in Nimes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-nimes-france-.html "roman art in Nimes")  and [Pont du Gard](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/swimming-canoeing-at-pont-du-gard-france-family-travel-adventures-family-friendly-camping-.html "Pont du gard, france ")  and more.

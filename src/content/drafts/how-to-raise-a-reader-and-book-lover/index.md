Does how you raise your child have an impact on raising a reader or book lover for life? Absolutely and studies show there are many things you can do to raise a reader with a passion for reading and books. We never expected our gifted child to teach herself to read at two, but we were encouraging multilingual language acquisition and reading even in the womb ( where it all starts).  
  
Today, after 7 years traveling the world nomadically as a family since she was five, our child still has a grand passion for reading and books. It's the first thing she wants to relax with even before breakfast when she wakes up and a wonderful big book is the first thing she grabs after changing into her comfy clothes after school ( in Spain or Penang where we dip into local schools for trilingual language immersion in our world school style).  
  
She first read Harry Potter when she was 4 and is still rereading them, having done it so much that she almost knows them by heart and is a huge Harry Potter fan. Where ever we go in this world, she finds books, bookstores, libraries to indulge her passion and it makes my job easy to combine travel and education to homeschool her while we travel.  
  

"If a fifth grade student reads an average of 40 minutes per day, that is over 2,350,000 words per year they are being exposed to and that means that student will generally rank in the 90th percentile for achievement.

A student who reads less than 5 minutes per day is only exposed to around 51,000 words per year and will likely rank in the 10th percentile." Shannon Dipple

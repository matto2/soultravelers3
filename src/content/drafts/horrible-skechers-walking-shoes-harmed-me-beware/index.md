Thanks to Skechers horrible walking shoes, horrible customer service, I still have two black, bruised, sore big toes from their shoes from my flight on May 2nd and likely will have this for the next year and despite my writing to them, posting this photo on Twitter & tagging them, I have not heard one word from them. So clearly they do not back products or care about their customers.

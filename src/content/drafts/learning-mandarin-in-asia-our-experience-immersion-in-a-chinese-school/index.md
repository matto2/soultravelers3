The best way to learn a language is immersion, so if you want to learn Mandarin, Asia is the best place to be and it allows one to immerse in the culture as well as the language.  We are monolinguals who have raised our child as a trilingual/triliterate from birth in 2000 ( Mandarin/Spanish/English) and after four winters in Spain in a Spanish school for her Spanish, we are now focused on learning deeper fluency in Mandarin in Asia. This is an update about our experiences with our American 10 year old child attending a Mandarin High School in Penang, Malaysia.

"Teach your children Mandarin, teach your grandchildren Mandarin and learn Mandarin yourself" because "Mandarin will be the most important language of the 21st century"  - Jim Rogers

"Learning to speak another's language means taking one's place in the human community. It means reaching out to others across cultural and linguistic boundaries. Language is far more than a systeme to be explained. It is our most important link to the world around us. Language is culture in motion. It is people interacting with people." - Savignon 

"One free lunch in the world is to learn another language in childhood" - Pinker

 The lead photo is our daughter studying with her local Chinese tutor in our winter home in Penang, Malaysia. It is common here for parents to hire teachers from schools to come to the home after school to do one on one tutoring. Many do it several times a week for all subjects and to help with homework. We usually do this just once a week, but the week before exams we moved it up to three times that week. She also works with our friends child, so that is how we found her.

"The 19th century was the century of the UK; the 20th century was the century of the US; and the 21st century is going to be the century of Chinea. So to participate in teh 21st century, you must know Mandarin. The better you know it, the better off you are." - Jim Rogers  
  
Our daughter is really enjoying her time in this all Mandarin High School and in fact she just had a week off after exams and said she really missed school while off. ( She had an all Spanish sleep over with friend from Mexico that lives here, so that and Skype calls to friends in Spain helps keep up her Spanish while she immerses in her Mandarin). She is the youngest in the school and only Caucasian so we were nervous about how this would all go as it was also a several year grade skip. We homeschool primarily, but she last did 4th grade in Spain ( we left last May) and then entered this school when their school year started in January, jumping into the 7th grade.  
  
We are there primarily for the Mandarin deep immersion, especially moving her reading and writing levels up to native ability, but were pleased that she did excellent on all of her exams recently. We have found [attending local foreign schools](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "attending local foreign schools for language immersion") the best way to [immerse deeply in a second or third language](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/family-travel-slovenia-movie-sign-languages-europe-travel-photo-.html "immerse deeply in a second or third language") and a culture. Even though most of the students in her class are 12 or 13 and there are 1000 bigger high school kids there that she interacts with daily, it's been a very good social match as Mozart is very mature, strong willed  and a leader in many ways.

The first few days were a challenge as she got lots of stares since she stood out and they were not use to having a tiny blond in their midst. We spent time preparing her for this many months in advance and she has also had much experience being the only Caucasian in a different culture from a young age. While we were in Spain she was working online with teachers and Johns Hopkins University online Mandarin classes and we did more of such after arriving in Asia.

"In many Asian countries, in Europe and the USA, Mandarin has emerged as the new must-have language" - Gaddol

"A different language is a different vision of life" - Fellini

"Language embodies the world view of a culture and is unique to the culture that created it. It reflects values and concepts that are deeped to be the most important by a culture. A language describes the culture it comes from." - Chomsky

"Learning a foreign language not only reveals how other societies think and feel, what they have experienced and value, and how they express themselve, it also provides a cultural mirror in which we can more clearly see our own society" - Gorsuch

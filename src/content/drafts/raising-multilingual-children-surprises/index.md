Â I love the surprises that come with raising a multilingual child!  
  
We are monolingual American parents raising a fluent as a native trilingual/triliterate child in Mandarin, Spanish and English ( soon to add French and make that quadrilingual when we head back to France).  
  
She is 12 now and it has been an amazing adventure...but I wouldn't have it any other way and it has allowed us to be global citizens too ( non-stop slow travel to 45 countries on 5 continents these last 7 1/2 years).  
  
Biggest surprise is when she recently won the Mandarin elocution contest at her Chinese school in Asia..first time in 63 year history of the school that a Caucasian won a trophy! Yea!!

But many other surprises along the way...like how she enjoyed Spanish even in the womb ( happy kicks always to it, as if she knew it was different than English).  
  
When she was hiding her sex from us by the way she was sitting when we did an ultrasound look at 5 months pregnant...we used Spanish..to get those happy kicks ..which changed her position so we could see she was a girl! ;)  
  
Also it was a shock that she spoke more Spanish early on ( many first words in Spanish) as she heard a LOT more English. ( Later I learned that Spanish is an easier language, so this is not uncommon). She also did sign language then and a rare Chinese word now and then.  
  
Another big surprise early on is she both walked and talked early..at 6 months. Usually babies that are learning multiple languages from birth are usually slower to talk so that is what I expected. Also often babies who walk early talk later and vice versa...so I certainly didn't expect either so early.  
  
One of her earliest words at that time was "biblioteca" ...that surprised us..but then she loved going to the library at that time with her dad for Spanish story time. LOL  
  
As monolingual parents the learning to read and write well in all 3 has been the hardest thing. Like her violin and piano, the biggest surprise for me is how long one has to work on these areas daily.  
  
It has been hard work to raise a trilingual kid, but soooo worth it!!

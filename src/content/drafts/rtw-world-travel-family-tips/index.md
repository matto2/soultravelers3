<!--more--> Well, like you I am not a fan of schools per say as I think they are still educating kids for jobs in the 1950's and because they do mass education and are always test based...they just can't work as well a child led learning.  
  
That said, dipping into schools for languages and culture immersion around the world has worked well for us and many advantages ...like experiencing this tea ceremony, or the group project she does with groups of kids, or the large choir experience, competitions like the elecution contest that she won...etc...to name a few.  
  
There are no calling kids stupid here, so that is not an issue. The discipline IS much more strict than in a USA school or European school ( the ones we went to) but it is done with deep caring ( not shaming) and is also part of learning the culture.  
  
A part of me at times wishes she never did any school, yet I also see there are some great advantages to this mostly homeschool and some dipping into schools..primarily foreign local schools...to get an immersion and language practice deeply and also to know a bit about how a school works..tests etc....since most people are educated that way so gives one a deeper understanding of that form.  
  
If we did our travel with no foreign schools what so ever, we would all miss some very deep immersion aspects. Schools play a big part in families lives and help us connect much more deeply than a traveler.  
  
So we've been much more enriched than just the language..which in itself is an awesome opportunity. She gets to learn Spanish and Mandarin reading and writing just like the natives starting at a first grade level.  
  
I DO get frustrated with schools because they just don't have the flexibility that an individual has..so some of it is just dumb and a waste of time in many ways.  
  
STILL, it has been much more rewarding than I even expected from the beginning. And part of that is about relationships as we come back to places over and over and keep those relationships alive.  
  
Mozart is a very social child, so gets much out of the social aspects of this school and the one in Spain and those friends. Most travelers who unschool don't have those kinds of connections over long periods and sometimes don't find any friends because most kids are in school.  
  
Homeschooling or unschooling in USA is easy to have consistent friends and lots of groups, park days etc for connection with the same friends over time and meeting new ones. With a traveling lifestyle it is different.  
  
We've found the unschool/worldschool combined with some repeated-over-years time in local foreign school works really well in meeting her trilingual language, cultural immersion and social goals of deep friendships over many years.  
  
I should write this on the blog! ;) We kind of made this up on our own...somewhat based on my own life which had LOTS of moving in it. Repeatedly returning to places, friends, homes solves the childhood instability levels that can come from constant travel and moving without bases.  
  
For better or worse...schools are the center of most families..so if approached in the right way..can really serve on many levels. The key is using them and not being used by them or caught up in the trusting them completely to educate your child paradigm.

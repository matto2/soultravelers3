The Secret to Long Term Travel  
  
  
  
  
  

<!--more--> Do you dream of long term travel and want to know the secret?  

I must admit it is a little more of a challenge if one is going to do this as a family as we are doing, rather than as a couple or single in one’s 20′s or 30′s. There is just more to consider, but it is still much easier than most realize and I think it is a growing trend.

By the time you get my age, you will know a lot more people who have died and being on the other side of the sands of time, one realizes how very short life is and what is truly important.

Nothing like having a kid to show you how fast time is zooming by. Our “baby” was 5 when we left on our world tour and now she is 8 and so enriched by this life of permanent family vacation/field trip.

The real secret to long term travel is that travel does not cost much, especially slow travel…..maintaining stuff does!

If one gives up endless buying of useless “stuff”, many would be amazed at how large one can live on little. People need to grant themselves freedom & it starts by valuing experiences over “stuff” and living in the ever present “now”.

We actually find it cheaper to travel the world slowly, than to live at home and we thrive on 25K a year, living a green, healthy and secure life with the best possible education for our child.

Sadly, many long term travelers miss the joy of travel and throw the freedom away with drinking binges, junk food or numbing TV in some cheap hotel room.That is almost as bad as those that pretend they are “2 week millionaires” & spend a bundle on a vacation, just to return to the same old grind for another year.

But, each to his own.My point is that if one is not happy at home, one will probably not be happy on the road since much of travel is an inner experience, The lifestyle is for those who are flexible, adaptable optimists and freedom junkies.

The secret to long term travel is the same as the secret to life, use your noodle, go for what you want, do the work required, live in the now, love it all!

Carpe Diem!

Of course I agree with you on WHY this is so important ( we are a family that has been on an open ended, non-stop world tour since 2006) but there are actually a LOT of families doing extended travel and it is a growing trend.  
  
“Far from being a reason not to travel and seek adventure, children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both”. Tim Ferriss

Over 400,000 Americans live full time on the road and high percentage of them are families. It’s a big country, so road schoolers and homeschoolers are still a minority for sure, but one that is growing.

There were 1.5 Million Homeschooled Students in the United States in 2007 & a VERY high percentage of homeschool families do extended travel of some kind as they are not bound by school limitations.

60% of schools will be virtual by the end of the decade, so that trend will continue to free families as work also becomes more virtual.

Slow travel costs VERY little and can even be done for free. (See Matador article about how to travel for free).

We live large & travel the world (even in expensive countries) on MUCH less than living at home…only 23 dollars per person per day. Total costs! That way we can sock away money as we roam….by living far beneath our means.

If we didn’t like luxury so much, we could live on much less!  
  

BTW if you look at the links on our blog we have a whole lists of families that did extended travel and blogged about it.

It’s become quite common in middle class America to take a year off to do world travel together for 6 months to a year.

MANY families do it, but just don’t blog it as it is hard to blog and travel as a family.  
  
get more for our educational buck on the road than even in an elite private school classroom. Plus, the boys were at a golden age-old enough to understand what they were experiencing but young enough to like hanging out with Mom and Dad.

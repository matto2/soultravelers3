<!--more--> Health care outside of the USA is sooo much better and cheaper. We save a bundle not having to worry about health insurance costs. Took my kid to a great children's hospital here in Asia the other week, saw a US trained MD, got 5 medicines ( pharmacy part of the office) ..total costs? 10 bucks! All the great health and dental care we got in Europe was free or very cheap, including surgery, ambulances, hospital stay.  
  
We do have a very high deductible expat insurance, but we have paid almost all out of pocket ( because of the high deductible). So yes, even over a week in the hospital and surgery was included in our $23/day pp living costs because it was very cheap/good in Austria compared to what it would have been in the USA. Instead of flying home for care, we knew it make a LOT more sense to stay there to heal.  
  
The place one needs it is really the USA where medical costs are absolutely shocking. Our insurance covers us everywhere in the world, but we have to add a special one when in the USA.  
  
Again we get a very high deductible and only have insurance more as asset protection in case we ran into something catastrophic.  
  
Things are sooo cheap in Asia we are considering dropping our insurance all together as it is not doing us any good here...but looking deeper.

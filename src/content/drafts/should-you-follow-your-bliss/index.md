<!--more--> “Follow your bliss.  
If you do follow your bliss,  
you put yourself on a kind of track  
that has been there all the while waiting for you,  
and the life you ought to be living  
is the one you are living.  
When you can see that,  
you begin to meet people  
who are in the field of your bliss,  
and they open the doors to you.  
I say, follow your bliss and don't be afraid,  
and doors will open  
where you didn't know they were going to be.  
If you follow your bliss,  
doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened for anyone else.”

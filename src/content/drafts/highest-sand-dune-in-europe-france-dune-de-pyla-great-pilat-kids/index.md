Sand and water are a perfect combination for family travel!  Add in a novelty like the highest sand dune in Europe and we could not miss this  stop as we left Spain's northern coast and headed into France. This region along the Atlantic coast is called the "landes" and is mostly very flat and covered with pines. It's a popular area for tourists from Bordeaux with lots of beaches.

We stayed at a campsite called [Camping La Foret](http://www.village-center.com/aquitaine/camping-la-foret.php) because it had a ladder up the east side of the dune. It was not as big as the giant dunes in [Merzouga](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html) in the [Sahara that Mozart climbed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrrAFDt9W_U&feature=channel_page), but  lots of fun, none the less. Can kids ever get enough of climbing or sand? I even enjoyed it, although could not make it up there with my mobility challenges ( bum knee crushed many years ago). It looked tempting and I enjoyed watching ( and photographing) Mozart and Davinci way up on top.

It is called [Dune de Pyla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_CDroTIPNo) and is on the coast just a kilometer away from the city of [Arcachon, France.](http://www.dune-pyla.com/english/welcome/index.php) It is quite impressive at 3km long and over 100 meters high. One needs the ladder for the steep side, but the other side is more sloping and leads to a remote beach. There are lots of bike trails and one can take a ferry from Arcachon to Cap Ferret. It is quite pretty in June with the unique combination of pines, wild flowers, large dune and sea views.

Can you see those two teeny specs at the top of the dune from our camper? That is Mozart and DaVinci!

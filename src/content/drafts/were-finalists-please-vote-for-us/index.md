We're really excited about the possibilities to be back on the road and winning this great contest. I just stumbled upon this possibility and it's perfect for us as we are looking into retiring in Europe and already planning European travel in 2022! We're excited to share all the information we learn with you plus lots of great photos, stories, videos and more coming soon!

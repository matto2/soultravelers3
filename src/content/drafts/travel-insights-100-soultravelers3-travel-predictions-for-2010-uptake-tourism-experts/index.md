A few months ago I was honored to be invited to become a member of [Travel Insights 100](http://www.uptake.com/travelinsights100), a panel of 100 travel experts that included activists, traditional media, independent travelers, and airline and hotel experts who have banded together to monitor travel insights and trends and share that information across the travel industry. Participants, who were hand selected by the folks at [UpTake.com](http://www.uptake.com/) (the travel search engine that helps travelers decide where to go, where to stay, or what to do) were recently surveyed about their predictions for travel during the upcoming year.

| 7 | Tech advances will continue to lead the way in the travel industry like most others. I'm glad we're positioned nicely as Partners with Youtube with a popular Soultravelers3 Youtube Channel as I think video is really going to take off in 2010. Even an ordinary family like ours can make viral travel videos! We should all be aware that according to Forrester, video is more likely to result in a first-page Google result than traditional SEO! Unlike Summers, I don't think the recession is over! I think it is a "reset" more like the one during the industrial revolution, not just a recession & economic problems will continue and will affect travel. More road trips will happen ( if oil prices don't increase too much) and more people will do extended travel. (This is the area of travel that we watch closely). The increase in people doing extended travel in 2009 was amazing ( affected by Tim Ferriss 4HWW, tech & the economy) and I think that trend will continue (4HWW just released a new edition). As schools deteriorate due to the economy ( 60% of schools will be virtual by the end of the decade) it'll encourage more families to do extended travel and think about more out-of-the-box solutions like wintering in a warmer climate for much less money or traveling off season etc. Singles, couples and even families will be capable of ultra mobile living and that will affect travel in new ways. By the end of the decade, travel will have a very different look than it does today! |

Dumbest? (And most outrageous) I'd say it has to be the TSA "raid" on two gentlemen travel bloggers who have young children!

Portugal has amazing food, gorgeous beaches, and great wine at great prices!   
  
  
**MOROCCO**

Morocco was one of the most fascinating countries that we visited, so we highly recommend for the adventurous traveler. There is not a more exotic city on the planet, than the [medina in Fez](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/fez.html "Fez medina"), [Morocco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/morocco/page/2/ "Morocco travel tips"). Our favorite city in this most magical country and we felt it showed more of the soul of the country, compared to the more popular and touristy Marrakech. It is like time travel back to the middle ages and like no other place on earth and do take time to visit the Sahara desert, the Land of Kasbahs, Essouria and more. Stay in a beautiful, [luxury riad](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/number-1-riad.html "luxuy riad in Morocco") like [Dar Seffarine](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/dar-seffarine.html#more "dar-seffarine riad in Fez morocco")

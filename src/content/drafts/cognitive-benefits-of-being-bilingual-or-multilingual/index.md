Thanks so much  for your wise thoughts and I appreciate your sharing your perspective and wanted to reply right away, but have just been too busy. My daughter is really enjoying teaching Spanish and Mandarin, so let me know when the timing works for you. I so agree with you that is is hard to make the decisions on what is best for each of our children.Yes, I think you are right that it is the strictness of the Mandarin schools here that prevents more from taking advantage, although I am sure they vary like most schools. We were certainly quite frightened to send our 10 year old to a 1000 kid high school here and I don't know  if I have ever been more nervous than on her first day ( although it was almost as equally scary on her first day in a local Spanish school in Spain at 6).  

  
My gut also cringed when she used her brand new 1st cell phone on the way to the Chinese school in Georgetown from BF via van to find out that she was the only girl on the bus and youngest there as she was in the school ( and only Caucasian). Sigh. Ten may sound big to a mother of a 2 or 3 year old, but trust me they are still your baby. ;)  
  
I DO understand why most don't pick this route and I'd probably have even greater concerns with a younger child for the reasons you state.  I certainly don't mean to question anyone's choices as each child and family is unique. We are homeschoolers by nature, so ANY school is a challenge for my freedom and individualistic mindset, but schools as immersion for languages/literacy can't be beat.  
  
We have the freedom to drop the school at any point, but thankfully it went well and was a very positive experience for her ( and not much different than most schools). We found the kids...who have always been in this system.. happy, creative and very normal. Also the Korean and other Asian kids who did their primary years in American or British International schools in Penang, adjusted with no problems. Being fluent reading/writing/speaking Mandarin is almost impossible for English speaking natives starting in adulthood ( and reading and writing is also very difficult for Native speaking kids in China who take much longer to learn their language literacy than other languages), so it was definitely worth the effort and challenges for us. It was certainly easier and healthier than doing this in China and worth our short time in the Chinese school system.  
  
I wouldn't want my child to be in this Mandarin school system from 1st through 12th grade ( but then, I also would not want her in ANY school system all those years as I prefer the freedom,family bonding time, unconstrained, child led, self paced advantages of home education that has allowed her to see most of the world at 12, be a rare American with 3 fluent written languages and be educationally years ahead of age peers and  taking high school and University classes though CTY and such.  
  
BUT when one looks at the stats of the Chinese in Malaysia ( a minority that is deeply discriminated against here by law and whom the majority send to Chinese medium schools) one has to admit the system works for many ( or maybe it's the Chinese culture with it's heavy emphasis on education and entrepreneurial ways ). ie "highly disproportionate percentage of Malaysia's [professional and educated class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_middle_class "Upper middle class"), with a record of high educational achievement, a high representation in the Malaysian professional white-collar workforce, and one of the highest household incomes"  
  
We actually found the Chinese school less strict than the very strict but good Catholic school my husband went to from 1st through 12th grade in the US. Like you, I dislike these kind of rigid learning environments, but I have to admit my husband did get an excellent education ( better than if he had gone to most public schools as I did) and he managed to thrive and end up in a highly creative field in the arts as a creative director. I think I would have not done well in such an environment, but each person is different.  
  
Some thrive in such environments, especially for short periods with attentive parents. We never would have known my daughter's passion for singing and public speaking had she not gone to this school as she is the one who chose on her own to join the 3 language choir ( singing several solos in front of large audiences that she loved), winning both the English and Mandarin elocution contests, being the youngest  finalist in the singing contest and asked to speak during Earth Day ceremonies. Also our whole family participating in things like the tea ceremony at the school and other celebrations was a benefit as well as deeper connections to the community here and Chinese culture. We were there just for the language, but got other creative benefits as well.  
  
I think if one is not in an immersion environment it is VERY difficult to be fully fluent and literate in a language, more so with a hard language like Mandarin. I saw this first hand when my fluent from birth bilingual baby went to school in Spain and THEN became a native speaker ( after 4 years)  by being in such a deeply immersed environment in a local school in Spain learning to read and write as they did starting in first grade ( and after she had been reading for years in English).  
  
Like so many people, I was a straight A student in Latin, Spanish and French classes through out my middle school and high school years, BUT I can't really read, write or speak in any of them.  
  
All language learning is valuable, but it takes many years of effort and immersion to make progress and as easy as kids learn languages, they lose them just as quickly if not kept up. I have seen even native speakers lose their mother tongues at as old as 12 if not kept up. So one has to definitely keep up languages to maintain fluency...just as one needs to keep up with musical instruments or most things...use it or lose it.  
  
I was quite surprised to read about your bilingual friends and have never heard of such a case and I know tons of bilingual and multilingual families. The MANY cognitive benefits of bilingualism have been well documented now in research and shows it makes us smarter and has life long advantages in many areas ( not just in language, but helps reading and math ie bilingual children perform better in math and logic skills than children with just one language).

Researchers say bilingual children develop a deeper understanding of the structure of language, an important skill for literacy and  
children who have been exposed early to a second language possess an overall "cognitive edge."  Numerous studies have also linked language education to higher scores on many standardized tests and studies show bilingualism may in fact impact the development of literacy in a number of significant ways.  
  
Dr. Bialystok says, "Our research has shown that reading progress amongst all bilingual children is improved over monolingual children". She also said, "I think there's a lot of worry out there about other languages conflicting with a child's ability to learn to read in English, but that's absolutely not the case."  
  
"Bilinguals have also been found to outperform monolinguals in reading ability (an effect modulated by the relationship of the two languages),[\[13\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_advantages_to_bilingualism#cite_note-Bialystok05-13) and better reading skills in L1 were demonstrated with as little as an hour a week of L2 learning,[\[14\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_advantages_to_bilingualism#cite_note-14) suggesting that being bilingual is also advantageous in the development of reading as well as spoken language"  
  
Despite being raised as a trilingual  from birth, my daughter both spoke and read early. ( She started walking and talking at 6 months, taught herself to read at 2, tested at 3 grade level of reading at 3, was reading Harry Potter at 4 and tested at 10th grade level of reading at 7 years and has always done remarkably well on Johns Hopkins University classes in reading and writing well above grade level etc).  
  
If your friends are weak in English reading and writing, I don't think it is because of their bilingualism at all, but perhaps the parents didn't encourage enough reading and writing in English. I know kids from England in Spain who didn't have one English book or magazine in their homes ( or Spanish for that matter). As a passionate reader, people without books shock me as I think it is rather easy to raise a reader.

My daughter is dominant in English so does most of her reading and writing in it, but she also always spends ( usually daily) time in reading, writing and speaking Mandarin and Spanish too ( and has for most of her life). Just as she does daily piano and violin practice...as she would lose some of her ability without the daily time, study and practice.  
  
I don't think there are ANY disadvantages to raising a bilingual or multilingual child and huge lifelong advantages in starting young...when the brain is most open to learning languages.  
  
That said, I thoroughly agree with you that knowing your child and choosing what you think is right for them is always the best advice! Sorry so long, but clearly a topic I have passion about. The other good thing about language learning is knowing 2 fluently, makes adding others easier and almost all skills in life are about code breaking, ( from reading to math etc) so mastering that skill early makes many things easier. Most Chinese here grow up with 3 or 4 fluent languages...maybe that is their key to success. ;)

    # Dalmatian Coast
    
    Of Croatia's 3,600 miles of glimmering coastline, the most famous (and touristed) stretch is its southernmost region: the Dalmatian Coast. Paralleling it are the rugged Dinaric Alps, whose geology helps make for remarkably clear seawater and hundreds of craggy islands (the most appealing are Hvar and Korčula). Here you'll find Croatia's top tourist town, Dubrovnik, and the big city of Split, with its impressive Roman ruins.

    # Royal Vineyards - a Story That Lasts for Nine Centuries
    
    The historical story of the Kraljevski vinogradi (Royal Vineyards), an impressive stretch of land with 300,000 vines, one of the largest in Croatia, is exciting and almost nine centuries long. It began with a deed of gift from the Croatian King Petar Krešimir IV, by which he donated, among other things, a large piece of land on the slopes above Petrčane near Zadar to the Benedictine monastery of St. Mary in Zadar. 
    
    The monastery was founded by the nun **Čika** (_**Chicca**_), a distinctive, significant and influential person in Zadar and beyond. After the death of her husband **Andrija**, she decided to be ordained, so she had a new monastery built on the foundations of a little old church. As she was of noble birth and born into an influential family, even of royal blood, she was on friendly terms with the then king of the Croats. He even addressed her with "s moja sestro" (sorormea-my sister), supported her intentions and the project and gave her fertile land, on which for centuries afterwards vineyards have been planted. 
    
    The Benedictine nuns of Zadar, the custodians of the priceless [**Gold and Silver of Zadar**](https://zadar.travel/news/gold-and-silver-of-zadar), zealously took care of their vineyards until the middle of the last century, when the government, carrying out the so-called land reform, took away their property. It was returned to them only by the Republic of Croatia twenty years ago, and then they decided to rent it for a long period to interested vine-growers.  Interestingly, these nuns from Zadar still work hard on their property in Smilčić near Zadar, so among other things, they make quality wines, as well as olive oil, liqueurs, jam and similar.

With its white stone villages, lavender fields and sapphire Adriatic water, it’s easy to see why [Croatia](https://www.wineenthusiast.com/region/croatia/) is popular. The country’s history runs deep. Traces of Greek, Roman, Venetian and Austro-Hungarian culture remain intricately woven into the landscape, though the country’s tourism fortunes only recently skyrocketed.

Croatia’s coastline provides the perfect backdrop for a wine-soaked holiday. Viticulture holds a long legacy in this Balkan country. Croatian wine may not resonate in most American households, as producers were only able to export after the country joined the European Union in 2013. But wine lovers should pay attention. Italy’s ascent can be attributed in part to its indigenous grapes. Croatia produces around 40 native grapes commercially, and is the original home of [Zinfandel](https://www.wineenthusiast.com/varietals/zinfandel/).

From north to south, Croatia’s grapes change with both culture and climate. On the Istrian peninsula, the main wines are white Malvazija Istarska and red Teran and Borgonja (Blaufränkisch). Done right, unoaked Malvazija Istarska shows fresh citrus and stony minerality, while Teran pops with iron and rosebush florals atop red fruit. A few winemakers produce a “super Istrian” in emulation of Tuscany’s blends that use international grapes like Cabernet Sauvignon alongside local varieties.

Moving south into Dalmatia, red grape Babić crops up, known for its firm tannins and sour cherry notes. Fuller-bodied, versatile white Pošip, originally from the island of Korčula, appears alongside lemony Debit.https://www.wineenthusiast.com/culture/travel/a-top-to-bottom-tour-of-croatias-wine-soaked-coastline/  
  

Settled between the 8th and 9th centuries B.C., Zadar highlights include its cathedral’s bell tower and Roman ruins excavated after being exposed during World War II bombings. Along the waterfront, two contemporary art works by architect Nikola Bašić—the [Sea Organ](https://morske-orgulje.business.site/), which makes music from wind and waves, and Greeting to the Sun, a collection of 300 photovoltaic cells programmed into a lightshow—are perfect for sunset.

Spend an afternoon with [Zadar Cooking Class](http://www.zadarcookingclass.com/) for hands-on guidance on how to prepare regional dishes and pair with Croatian wines. Pick up wines or cherry brandy from noted producer Bibich Winery at the shop on Ulica Kraljskog Dalmatina. Each day, [Bistro Pjat](https://www.facebook.com/bistropjatzadar/) creates a market-driven menu of traditional foods like brudet, a Croatian fish stew. Two more spots: down a hidden street to whitewashed [La Gavun Food & Wine Bar](https://foodwine-bar-la-gavun.business.site/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral) for stuffed squid, and over to [Pet Bunara](https://petbunara.com/) which features a strong Dalmatian wine list and seasonal dishes made with local ingredients.

Several excellent and beautiful wineries line this stretch of coastline. Outside of Zadar, book a tasting with light bites at [Kraljevski Vinogradi](https://www.kraljevski-vinogradi.hr/en/), which translates to Royal Vineyards. Sea views and lavender bushes greet guests as they pass beneath the stone archway to the property. Owners focus on Pošip and Plavac Mali.

## Nestled along Croatia’s breathtaking coastline lies the stunning Dalmatia region, a paradise for wine enthusiasts and connoisseurs alike**. With its picturesque landscapes, sun-kissed vineyards, and rich winemaking heritage that dates back centuries, Dalmatia has firmly established itself as a premier destination for oenophiles seeking unforgettable tasting experiences.

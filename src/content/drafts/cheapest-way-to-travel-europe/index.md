With 6 years of travel around Europe on just $23/day per person, we've learned lots about how to enjoy a trip to Europe the most, yet quite luxuriously on the smallest budget. We recommend slow travel first as that will save you lots of money and prevent travel burnout.  
  
**WHERE TO STAY**  
  
Hostels can work for singles I hear, if you stay in a large dorm room, but definitely not as good for families or couples traveling Europe.  Hotels can actually be a cheaper option sometimes like we did in [Provence](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/good-morning-pr.html "Provence bargain hotel") and at the best [budget hotel in  London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/top-budget-hotel-london-travelodge-waterloo-review-central-london-lodging-bargain-family-friendly.html "best budget hotel london"). Another option, [Long term vacation rentals like in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "how to vacation rental apartment spain") or [short term vacation rental in London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/10/-roomorama-short-term-rentals-usa-london-budget-hotel-apartments-.html "short term vacation rental in London") can make a great base.  
  
Airbnb and couchsurfing ( like we did in Tahiti) are other great ideas, but popular so you will have to plan ahead.  
  
**CHEAPEST BUDGET LODGING IN EUROPE**  
  
The very cheapest way to travel Europe? Think smart like a European and go for one of Europe's 10,000 campgrounds. Sadly, most  American's miss this and it is the best way to meet middle-class Europeans and most campgrounds are often very luxurious resorts with first class ammenities like pools, restaurants, gyms, and stores. It is a totally different world than camping in North America and campgrounds are available in every city and popular location in Europe.

**FREE LODGING IN EUROPE**  
  
Even cheaper than Europe Campgrounds, is free camping in Europe or "wild" camping that is legal in almost all of Europe. Even easier with a motorhome than a tent, where one can camp overnight in any legal parking spot.

" I would teach children music, physics, and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning" Plato  
  
“Growing up in a musically rich environment is often advantageous for children’s language development” - Mary Luehrisen  
  
  
Pythagorus said "Music is math made audible".  
  
Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline, and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart.

“There’s some good neuroscience research that children involved in music have larger growth of neural activity than people not in music training. When you’re a musician and you’re playing an instrument, you have to be using more of your brain,” says Dr. Eric Rasmussen,( The Johns Hopkins University)

Is "Don't Look Up" the best movie of the year? It's a truly terrifying, yet very funny satire and commentary about our cultural apathy, corrupt government and media and it went super viral on Netflix purely by word of mouth! We haven't had a movie that has captured the zeitgeist like this since "Dr Strangelove" and "Network".   
  
"Adam McKay’s new movie may be the first film in 57 years to equal the comedy and horror of Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece." - Jon Schwarz in Intercept   
  
"Don't judge the movie as a movie. Judge it as a cultural exposé. " Bob Lefsetz

I do not laugh easily at movies & don't remember ever laughing at a trailer before, but even the trailer had me hysterically laughing out loud, not for the jokes, but for how perfectly it portrayed this absurd, corrupt moment in time. I know a LOT of people who were also deeply moved by this surprise satire who just happened upon it. Most people loved it, some people and critics hated it, but it moved people and the masses in a way no movie has in a long, long time.   
  

Yeah, almost all by word of mouth, yet that is one of the hardest things to do in today's society. Netflix reports that people have clocked over 263 million watch hours watching the latest satire since its release on the streaming platform the first  11 days and "Don't Look Up" is one of the streaming giant's most viewed films of ALL time ALREADY! It was the biggest hit by far over the holiday and number one on Netflix in every country.  
  
People don't watch what critics like, or only for stars, people watch what they LOVE and tell their friends they have to watch. And then talk about it with friends online everywhere. That's the hardest thing to do in today's culture...get noticed,  go viral, become a point of public discussion on social media and everywhere. 

 PR campaigns & stars don't matter if the public does not like it.  
  
Best picture of the year, hands down and no other film is getting as much attention and word of mouth ..it is the virtual water cooler star with endless comments and memes on all social media by just regular folks who love it. This film has more real people buzz than ANY other current film for a reason. Not the stars or the critics but just because it fits this moment like no other film has done in a long, long time and people love that!

  
  

In my opinion there were some great acting and writing bits in this film ,but what made it stupendous and what

is making it go viral is that it expressed so clearly the total insanity of this corrupt government/politics & corrupt media/culture moment so perfectly on Netflix at xmas as covid exploded again & nothing the vast majority of people wants a  
  

  
  
  
  
On the surface, [#DontLookUp![](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2025/09/Netflix_DontLookUpFilm_2021.png)](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontLookUp?src=hashtag_click) is a clever satire making fun of dumb ass Republican legislators and their cult-like supporters. But it’s a truly terrifying social commentary about capitalism and our apathy towards climate change. Best film of the year.

"Don't Look up" is the best movie I have ever seen!! "Best picture of the year, hands down.Don't judge the movie as a movie. Judge it as a cultural exposé. We haven't had a movie that's captured the zeitgeist like this since "Network." And that may be a better movie, but it's not as good of a snapshot of life in these United States and the media business."-

Bob Lefsetz (very well said imho)

This movie is going viral for a reason - word of mouth, everyone is talking about

it online everywhere and watching it!! It is meant to wake up all thinking people like no movie ever has and captures the insanity of this moment in time like nothing else !!!! Took me from a deep pandemic xmas blues to laughing out loud so unexpectedly like I never have for a trailer!!

"Don't judge the movie as a movie. Judge it as a cultural exposé. ".

I do not laugh easily at movies & don't remember ever laughing at a trailer before, but even the trailer had me hysterically laughing out loud, not for the jokes, but for how perfectly it portrayed this absurd, corrupt moment in time. I know a LOT of people who were also deeply moved by this surprise satire who just happened upon it.

I am not a film critic, but I was an award winning actress for 20 years who co-starred in movies with Kirk Douglas, Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn, Josh Brolin etc etc and worked with legendary directors & also on Broadway. So I see a LOT of films and know a lot about the business of filmmaking ( I have even directed a few small projects myself).

In my opinion there were some great acting and writing bits in this film ,but what made it stupendous and what

is making it go viral is that it expressed so clearly the total insanity of this corrupt government/politics & corrupt media/culture moment so perfectly on Netflix at xmas as covid exploded again & nothing the vast majority of people wants and needs gets done to save us or the planet. It is a great wake up call movie that suits this moment in time. THAT is what makes it great and why so many are watching it and talking about it. Not the critics, but real people.

I am so so so tired of dark, dreary so called "art" films ( and wrote a review of this one - [https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/.../nomadland-is-the-worst...](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soultravelers3.com%2F2021%2F02%2Fnomadland-is-the-worst-movie-ever-.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3RTAfM990K1m5KgOCrNgWl_7eiRND1AKjSj8mDOSp9K-XgOsWIW9WszaQ&h=AT0edFt2fukx8Z1PbaGEwtAwBDdh0_wqZpRK00Yin5BcdVo6-ZmHss7qBYdiEbgM8xtbowF-qTNC7RlGumAerlzrIcXw-3U7jI4h9-J-I0TFQhlMoiygvfgslv5dhf3D3o0ZlckWP7DHQWFSk9fj2Vc&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT2Qy6WD7CizEU3yde-FRLmWdku6whqY9ZtL0utia8QM8Qdch85wmjh2irWjGRK1P2nAGhP-miOHNethUS180HusLjpWM4ovDA2vUf7I0QgxRd6Antvh4cKU_KwvZIYJi-BpHe4e3KA9ae18g9uD)) that suck, but get high praise from the "bought" PR machine.

Timing is part of what made this so great and why it is going viral and making many think. THAT is what makes it extraordinary. It is the perfect film for this moment in time. Not in theaters ( where no one goes now) but on Netflix where the world congregates right now during this annual

escape and everyone is talking about it!!  
  

Also have you seen many of the other comments in reviews and online like this review, " DON’T LOOK UP” IS AS FUNNY AND TERRIFYING ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AS “DR. STRANGELOVE” WAS ABOUT NUCLEAR WAR

Adam McKay’s new movie may be the first film in 57 years to equal the comedy and horror of Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece."

I do understand your points, as I don't think "Don't Look Up" is a perfect movie and it has flaws like all films, but I DO think it is a masterpiece too and part of that is timing and that it unites us in the current key medium...Netflix.

Even when I see one person who doesn't like it, or see a less than favorable review, I see her/them getting tons of comments from people who love it and rave about this movie. This movie MOOOOOVES people ..flaws and all.

Does the 21st century belong to China as so many predict about this fastest growing super power? "If the 19th century belonged to Britain, and the 20th century to the United States, then the 21st century  will surely belong to China." Jim Rogers  
  
As adveturous monolingual American parents raising a young trilingual daughter who is fluent in Mandarin, we think there has never been a better time to visit this 5000 year old culture and booming, exciting, exotic, warm-hearted country! With over 3 million overseas tourists visiting Beijing every year, it takes no time to understand why, with it's 6 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, scrumptious food, art and shopping.  
  
The brand new, exquisite Four Seasons Beijing was the perfect place to begin our month long independent tour where we mostly stayed with locals for deep language immersion. We arrived on opening day and were very honored to be one of the first guests to be spoiled by the glorious opulance and spectacular service, ( starting with a limo ride from the airport)  which comforted us after a long flight and pampered us as we adjusted to this fast-paced, dramatic city of 22 million people.  
  
One of the things that most impressed us about China, was the generosity, kindness and hospitality of the people that will be treasures in our memories forever. Since this was a self-created language immersion trip for our 12 year old, we requested that the Four Seasons staff talk to her only in Mandarin and that gave her more confidence as we explored the city to approach and talk to strangers in Chinese.

How lucky she was to already be fluent in Chinese on her first visit to China,  which helped so much for all of us to bond in deeper ways with the people and be a bridge between East and West. People lit up in delighted surprise to see a little blond girl able to communicate well, as few on the streets speak English.  
  
The Four Seasons concierge arranged a perfect tour of city highlights with Peking duck for lunch at one of the most famous restaurants in Beijing which enchanted each one of us and gave us a royal start to our China journey.  Here are a few of our favorite photos from this life-changing trip to China which has us wanting to return again for more:

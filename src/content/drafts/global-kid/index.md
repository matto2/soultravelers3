Growing up as a global kid is essential today for 21st century children in our shrinking world, and there are many ways to do that, but travel and learning languages are the best ways to get first-hand experience with the people of our planet.  
  
These kids will need to know how to relate across borders, in different languages, cultures and how to celebrate diversity and difference, knowing we all belong to the family of man. I love Mozart's perspective on the value of travel in this video:

On one trip home, Mozart decided to store these toys she had collected around the world, each with it's own special memories for our travel kid because living a minimalist life as a nomadic kid traveling with just carry-on luggage, "things" are limited as much as experiences are enriched and life lessons come from both experiences.  
  
Everything has a story and these global gifts warm our hearts in reminiscing, so we thought you'd enjoy this  too!  
  
"Providing kids with the experience of travel broadens their horizons and opens up their minds to learning." Dr. William Norman

The lioness she named "Tigress" with a French accent, she got at the Louvre at six, celebrating her birthday in Paris. We returned to this little restuarant we stumbled upon in the rain as well as the Louvre again when she was 10 as it became a very special place in our family vacation lore.

That is where we bought the Pippi doll and tons of Astrid Lingren books ( that you can't buy in the USA) which gives a kid much greater understanding of Swedish culture and she even had the lead characters in a play ( famous in Sweden) sing her happy birthday in Swedish ( totally different song and tune than the one we sing). <br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/R-jwBGqJ9zY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  
  
When we went to the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland, we couldn't resist buying  Mozart a kilt, shirt, tam and Scottish wool knit sweater at a cute shop......

which just added to the whole experience, including that little sheep dressed in  his tradional Scottish plaids and clothing.

Last but not least, is the little aviation bear we got at the [Kennedy Space center](http://www.nasa.gov/home/index.html "kennedy space center") where we  learned all about rockets and going to the moon during our Florida road trip and vacation.  
  
Mozart didn't see much of the USA during her Primary years, but now that she is fluent in Mandarin and Spanish, we be exploring more of North America and USA road trips. This will allow her to focus more on her singing and take community college classes as part of her homeschool...but we will still do international travel.  
  
We are moving this week end and off to a big road trip from Dallas to New York City so Mozart can be the youngest back stage reporter for Fashion Week. Life is full of change!  
  
Have you ever bought your child or yourself something special abroad or in your travels that you cherish for all the memories it brings up?

England is a fascinating destination for children.

Traveling internationally with kids does not have to prove challenging or expensive. With a little planning, some ingenuity, a bit of research and an open mind, you will be able to show your kids the best of jolly old Englandâ€”from the thrill of riding the Tube to the history and adventure of the Tower of London.

#### Step 1

Research attractions suitable for kids. The Tower of London does charge admission but makes an interesting excursion. Kids will love the chance to check out some of the more gruesome features of the Tower compound--such as the courtyard are where Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, two of King Henry VII's wives, were executed. Also on display is the chilling "Rack," said to be an example of the kind of torture once perpetrated at the Tower. On the lighter side, the Tower of London is also home to the nation's vault of Crown Jewels--crowns, scepters and other ornaments fit for kings and queens. Just across the street is the world famous Tower Bridge, worth walking across to complete a full day.

#### Step 2

Plan a day at the museums. One of the best features of the city is its bounty of free museums. With so many to choose from, you will have to assess the best museums suitable for your child's age. Older children will love the British Museum with its massive collection of sculpture, art and artifacts from almost every era of ancient history. Especially compelling and renowned around the world is the museum's world-class displays of Egyptian artifacts spanning several centuries. Mummies, sepulchers, vaults, graves and funerary items of every description provide a fascinating and unforgettable day (or two) at the museum. Younger children might prefer the Science Museum or Natural History Museum featuring live-action dinosaur exhibits.

#### Step 3

Get around town using public transportation. Not only is it highly efficient and economic to use, London's famous subway system and red double-decker buses are a blast for kids. The London Underground (famously called the Tube) is easy to use. Free maps and station announcements make it even easier. Kids under age 10 ride free when accompanied by an adult, while kids over 12 can ride for a discounted rate (tickets are best purchased each day for travel after 9:00 a.m. for the best prices). The red bus routes and Tube system are connected in that they generally follow the same similar routes, but when you travel above ground, sightseeing is enhanced; when you travel below ground, the system moves more quickly. Both are included in your admission, so give the kids a taste of each.  
  
Free museum admissions, huge parks, tons of kid friendly attractions make London an easy and pleasant destination with kids. Though the city is huge and very spread out, most kids will consider riding the tube or red London buses part of the adventure. Most restaurants have high chairs, making it easy to dine out with kids.

[Four Seasons Dallas Resort](http://www.fourseasons.com/dallas/ "Four Seasons Dallas") was a highlight for us on our recent [winter road trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/road-trip-usa-best-of-the-west.html "winter road trip") across America's [Southwest](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/winter-road-trip-americas-southwest-.html "America's southwest") and has something for everyone in the family.

Many think of 400 acre  [FS Dallas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/dallas-luxury-resort-arriving-to-big-d-in-style.html "Four Season Dallas") resort for the summer with it's spectacular 5,500-square-foot (511-square-metre) outdoor pool with movie nights for kids or the two 18-hole championship golf courses or world-class indoor and outdoor tennis courts, but it is truly an all-season resort and is perfect for a winter break.

We had glorious, sunny 70 plus degree days in January when there, but even if the weather isn't as cooperative, the amazing 176,000-square-foot Sports Club, 4 indoor and 8 outdoor tennis courts, and indoor, salt water lap pool are and the spa is perfect in every season.

Our [trilingual new teen](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/celebrating-13th-birthday-in-healthy-ways-at-four-seasons-hotel-sydney.html "trilingual new teen") Mozart loved getting a golf lesson at the Four Season Golf School with well known PGA  pro [Tim Cusick](http://www.timcusickgolf.com/index.html "Tim Cusick golf teacher") , adored her tennis lesson and playing with her dad, plus we all learned a lot of sports history with their museum quality Hall of Champions. The expansive fitness center, including squash, racquetball and basketball courts, delighted the whole family and Mozart loved the indoor jogging track.  
  
Mom and daughter time at the zen-like Spa was sublime from the herbal teas, treatments and hydrotherapy to the largest sauna I have ever seen.

We all loved the healthy food and when I was indulging in the most relaxing massage, the "mouse at play" snuck in a delectable dessert.

Mozart couldn't pass up the scrumptious hot chocolate when ever we were near the lobby or getting around by golf cart.

Big D is famous for shopping, so we couldn't miss that or a chance to do [educational homeschool on the road](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/home-school-science-unschool-and-world-school-tips.html "educational homeschool on the road") by going to the awesome hands-on  Perot Museum in downtown Dallas. 13 year old Mozart was thrilled to do a chromosone dissection in the biolab, experience  an earthquake and race a dinosaur!

One thing we love about Four Seasons Hotels and resorts is how each one is unique, yet service is always impeccable and we found out this first hand on our road trip. We were blown away by the sports opportunities at this award-winning golf resort, which was like nothing else we have seen before.

I have to agree with [Billy Akaisha](https://www.facebook.com/billy.akaisha) ..( who was one of our inspirations when we started this non-stop travel lifestyle in 2005 when we sold our home.  
  
We do have a child...now a fluent trilingual at 13, and we have found this travel life "widened and deepened" our sense of community.  
  
I have always found it fascinating that sooo many travel families are Mormons like this women...and I think that community is a help as I always read about them ( like her in this article) finding church community where ever they go.  
  
Perhaps Mormons in Utah who never travel ( except missions) does give one more a sense of community ( I don't know) or another tight knit community through a church belief system or other commonality.  
  
BUT for most of the US, I don't think there really is any strong community that stays the same over 20 years.  
  
So I think some of her assumptions that it would be different for them grief wise is an illusion. I think that kind of devastating grief is hard and isolating no matter where you have to walk through it as no one can ever really understand.  
  
Also she is talking about an expat life...with a husband often at a distance & the whole family dependent on his companies whims....soooooo different and so much harder than a nomadic like where one is together and totally in charge of where you live and can return regularly to family and friends....at your OWN whim.  
  
Also it seems like much of her expat life happened before the internet and skype which makes a HUGE difference.  
  
With an only child, we very much have always thought/worked long and hard about creating long term community for our daughter as we roam the world and feel we have done a great job of that ( in several languages). She remains close with friends and family at home as well as in Europe and Asia. ...talks to them regularly while enjoying real life friends here ( or where ever we are).  
  
I grew up moving a lot and think it was one of the best parts of my childhood and added so much to my creativity and flexibility. My husband grew up in one town and went to one school system...and although he loves the people "back home", he has never had much contact with them sense he left for college ( even when we were not traveling) and I think that is typical ...even for people who never left.

[Billy Akaisha](https://www.facebook.com/billy.akaisha) My husband and I have been traveling for over 2 decades. I will admit to you right off that we do not have children and with this article in mind, that is a major point. However, I have found that traveling has widened and deepened my sense of community because I am not limited to just one neighborhood. I have close friends all over the world. While I realize that Skyping, emailing and sending postcards isn't the same as doing the dishes together, the sorts of conversations we are able to have due to the preciousness of distance has added a profound appreciation to my life.

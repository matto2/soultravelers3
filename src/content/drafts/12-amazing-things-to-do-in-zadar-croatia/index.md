“Zadar has the most beautiful sunset in the world, more beautiful than the one in Key West, in Florida, applauded at every evening.” - Alfred Hitchcock  

### **1) Don't Miss Sunset &  Greeting The Sun** 

  
We think watching the famous sunset is the best thing to do in Zadar! Like Hitchcock, I have seen amazing sunsets around the world, ( including [Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/world-famous-key-west-sunset.html) repeatedly) but I agree with him that they are the best in the world here. We were really stunned at how every single day we were here, every single sunset was spectacular. 

  
[![ 12 Amazing Things To Do in Zadar  Croatia  celebrate sunset beauty ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2024/02/26bff08b271e75893a32b9019215dd79.jpg " 12 Amazing Things To Do in Zadar  Croatia  celebrate sunset beauty ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3abd090200b.jpg-pi)

World-famous architect Nikola Bašić created this [Greeting the Sun Light construction](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjbJW7kMlGM/) that adds to the unique fun. There is just something really touching about celebrating the sunset with a group of people. Locals and tourist gather together and celebrate. It is very clever how the colors of this creation just adds more magic to the occasion. No other place has this, so adds to Zadar's uniqueness.

### **2) Listen to the Sea Organ  
  
  
**

The unique and special Sea Organ is another wonder created by architect Nikola Bašić . It is the most famous attraction in Zadar. This amazing, clever architectural wonder uses the Zadar Adriatic's waves to  make music 24 hours a day. It is a very haunting sound made by 35 organ pipes that were carved into the seaside promenade.Wind and water play and gorgeous sea views, what is not to love?

### **3) Visit Land Gate with Lion** 

  
We loved this Land Gate in Zadar. One of my favorite attractions in Zadar. This Renaissance-style gate was built in 1543 and it's also known as St Chrysogonus' Gate (Vrata Sv Krševana).You can see the Venetian winged lion and Zadar's patron saint, St Chrysogonus on horseback. As well as the coat of arms the Republic of Venice. It is still used by traffic today and still impresses.

The best place to get photos is the nearby beautiful pleasure garden called the Queen Jelena Madijevka Park.It is Croatia's oldest park.  Although getting closeup and walking through this ancient gate is also fun. Visiting historical gems like this makes Zadar special.

### **4) Climb Bell Tower of St. Anastasia's Cathedral**  

When visiting Zadar do not miss the views from climbing  the Bell Tower! Visiting this part of the Church of St. Anastasia and its Baroque architectural style is a must do. You will love seeing the beautiful 360 degree views of Zadar. It only costs €3 to climb up the tower. There are 180 steps to reach the top of the  bell tower but worth seeing the amazing views over the city and sea. The first few steps are narrow, but it gets better as you climb.

### **5) Visit Charming Foša Harbor**

  
 One of our favorite sites in Zadar is the adorable, ancient Foša harbor! It is very close to the Lion Gate I mention above in the number 3 attraction. You can also see the ancient sea walls best from here. It is a lovely place to walk and this magnificent view is from the Queen Jelena Madijevka Park. The small boat and water adds charm. This area is very picturesque and peaceful.

### **6) Explore Zadar Old Town**

Part of what makes Zadar an increasingly popular city break destination is it combines nature, beautiful coast and a rich history. Most of my list of best things to do in Zadar are  within the fortified walls of the Old Town. Zadar is said to be the oldest settlement in Croatia, dating back 3000 years. The Old Town is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is also all very walkable which we enjoyed.

### **7) Visit The Five Wells Square** 

Another Zadar attraction not to miss is this pretty Square of Five Wells that was built in 1574. It is close by the the ancient  Queen Jelena Madijevka Park. It is also a great place to eat like we did,  at the many great restaurants here. This square was named after the 5 wells that were used to supply Zadar with water in ancient times. Like so much of Zadar it has an eclectic mix of Roman, Venetian, and medieval influences

### **8) Visit Best Ocean View Vineyard in Croatia**

  
 If you love wine tasting and vineyards, do not miss Zadar! [Visiting  Zadar's gorgeous vineyards](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjdRF90DNO0/) is a must see attraction. We were  thrilled to discover the magnificent Royal Vineyards ( Kraljevski vinogradi). I have never seen a more beautiful vineyard location with sea views & 300,000 vines! Paralleling to the Adriatic sea view are the rugged Dinaric Alps, whose geology helps make for remarkably clear seawater and distant islands to view. The Royal Vineyards are located only 12 kilometers from the beautiful, [historical city of Zadar](https://www.roughguides.com/article/why-you-need-to-visit-zadar-croatia/) .The [vineyards](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyAkSWKMNNq/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=05d03adc-4c9e-4bb3-997c-0c7415704a2a) are situated on twenty five acres of land & are almost nine centuries old. Truly, one of the most dazzling locations of northern Dalmatia and the world. We were awestruck before even [tasting the wine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-IOrnUYpPg)!

### **9) See Roman Ruins** 

Zadar, Croatia is known for it's significant historical heritage as a 3,000-year-old city.  Are you interested in [seeing  Roman ruins](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/best-places-to-visit-ancient-roman-and-greek-ruins.html#more)? Zadar might not have the big name of nearby [Split](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cjn3GPrDzsP/), or [Pula arena](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3-mYiYspSz/), but it also dates back to Roman times. Zadar has the largest Roman Forum on the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea. As you can see in this photo, the impressive medieval St Donatis Church of Zadar built in the 9th century stands on remains of the Roman temple and Forum. The same is true for the Church of St. Anastasia and its Baroque architectural style. You can see the Bell Tower I mentioned in my 4th tip on where to go in  Zadar. This mix of history is part of what makes Zadar enticing.

### **10) Stroll The Riva**

  
One of the best things to do in Zadar is just walk on the seafront which is called the Riva. The “Riva” is a term used  in all of  Croatia and it means the promenade that runs along the Adriatic Sea. Dalmatian cities tend to face the sea and they take great pride in their sea walkways. Locals and tourists walk this long stone pier to enjoy the sun, nature,  sea and to meet for gatherings. Zadar's riva is embellished with flowers, ancient trees and lush vegetation. It is much longer than the sea organ area which is mid way. It also goes past Zadar's University which is the oldest in Croatia and founded in 1396. This riva was first constructed in 1868, so has a long history.

### **11) Day Trip Krka Waterfall National Park**

One of the wonderful things about Zadar is it is close to lots of fantastic day trips. There are several gorgeous national parks in Croatia that you must see. Thankfully, besides all of it's charms, Zadar is ideal base for visiting the parks. Zadar drive time to Krka Waterfall National Park is only one hour to 90 minutes ( depending on traffic). It is only 75 kilometers or 46 miles away. This parks key attraction are the beautiful Skradinski Buk Waterfalls.There is easy, enjoyable hiking in nature as well as the historic 15th-century Krka Monastery. I hear it is very crowded in summer, like most of  Croatia and Europe in July and August. But it was perfect when we visited in the early fall. Renting a car is the easiest way, but private transfers and buses are also available.

### **12)** **Day Trip to Unesco Plitvice Lakes National Park**

Looking for another perfect day trip to do from Zadar? One of the most important natural wonders near Zadar is [Unesco's  Plitvice Lakes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/peaceful-pretty.html). It is less than 2 hours by car from Zadar. You can  get to the gorgeous  Plitvice National Park by rental car, bus or private transfer. The sixteen, (often vivid turquoise) lakes, cascading waterfalls, pristine forests , caves and canyons, make Plitvicka National Park one of the prettiest areas we have visited and well deserving of its UNESCO billing.We loved the peacefulness of Plitvicka (Plitvice) park as well as the beauty and we certainly got our exercise there as we trekked the rustic log paths up and down from nine in the morning until almost sunset. It is a well maintained park with trails for all levels of trekking. There were some wonderful bike trails if you prefer that.

###  **Best Time to Visit Zadar Croatia?** 

  
The very best time to visit Zadar and Croatia is early fall and late spring. The Med weather is mostly sunny and warm then, but crowds will be less. Like most places in Europe,  it is best to avoid July and August peak season. Prices are high and crowds are at their worst. Planning a trip to Croatia? Look at my other posts and guides for more tips.

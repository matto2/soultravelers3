**GOOD BYE 2009**

How was your year? As promised, this is our travel photo review! 2009 was an exciting and dramatic year for us. It seems it is the custom in the blogosphere to do a review and perhaps I should have posted it before we began 2010, but it made more sense to me to post this after the holidays.

January began with a first! Our 8 year old watched  [America's first multi-cultural, mixed-race President's Inauguration](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/01/family-travel-photospain-obama-inauguration-09.html#more) live from the BBC from our living room in Spain.

February blew us away because we [got nominated for](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/omg-soultravelers3-got-3-lonely-planet-nominations.html#more) three [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations) Travel [Blog Awards](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations) which was beyond thrilling. I think we were the only ones to get three nominations and I didn't even know about it until a friend from Australia told me on Twitter.

Speaking of [Twitter,](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3) one of our most popular posts this year was [Twitter & Travel 2.0](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/twitter-travel-20.html#more) I'm still amazed at how much the internet & the good friends that we have made through it, have influenced our travels. As I read how 60% of schools will be virtual by the end of the decade, watch the "economy reset" continue, witness the continue increase of digital nomads & 4HWW types, I'm more convinced than ever that the world is going through a huge change/shift like during the industrial revolution. We are living in [exponential times](http://soultravelers3new.local/education.html). I thought 4000 followers on Twitter was a lot last February and now we have about 24,650 and growing daily!

In March, we celebrated my birthday in Granada, listened to a left handed guitar playing gitano, explored the Alhambra at night, soaked in a divine Arabic public bath, had yummy food and then took Mozart skiing in the Sierra Nevada mountains before heading home to the warm Med sea beach. Not too many get to ski both Sierra Nevada Mountain ranges ( California and Spain) by 8 years old, but the whole long weekend was so grand, we might do it again this year!

April meant another spectacular Semana Santa in Spain! There are no words to describe the exotic and elaborate Easter week celebrations in Spain, so I try to share them in pictures. Seville is the star of Semana Santa and I'm so grateful we saw that, but I also really so appreciate it in our little village, where we know everyone. Oh and [we won two](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/soultravelers3-won-2-lonely-planet-travel-awards-thank-you.html) of those Lonely Planet Travel Blog Awards which made our decade!!

In May, I won my first contest and 200 dollars worth of clothes!  We were packing up and completing our winter in Spain, so I still haven't ordered the clothes because my mom has to pick them up and have a place to send them to, but we will get to that part soon.

In June we headed out on our six months on the road! One of our first important stops this year was Portugal again, so that Mozart could swim with the dolphins. It was a breathtakingly stunning experience that none of us will ever forget and I will blog all the details soon!

We celebrated the fourth of July in gorgeous hidden beaches in the Costa Brava and then the rest of the month in heavenly Cinque Terra. Both are beyond compare so I really must have two pictures for this month.

August was divine and started with two operas at the ancient coliseum (2nd largest after Rome) the Arena in Verona and we stayed at our favorite agroguismo and ate all the delicious fruit and grapes off the vine that surrounded us. Then we sauntered through Slovenia, swam in one of the worlds largest pools in Graz, met a family of long time readers of our blog in Vienna, and visited the trumpeter in Krakow where we also had a blast eating dunplings at a peirigi festival!

We thought we really had found total August bliss when we discovered that we had a huge, park-like campsite to ourselves right on the Danube in Melk, Austria for 20 euros a night. It was Nervana as we explored this wine region by bike and boat, but alas as we were about to leave, I ended up in a bike wreck that changed our lives forever.

Thus, most of September was about hospitals, pain and recovery, as we all dealt with and continue to deal with a right handed mother who has no right hand or arm. Luckily it is healing, but the nerve damage makes for a very painful and slow recovery. I couldn't even get in our RV, so we got an apartment in Melk just accross the street from the hospital. Then, I read that some dear friends were gathering in London for a movie screening and book launch and I knew we had to go..some way, some how!

So in late September we made it to London and had a great time thanks to Roomorama, DaVinci's hard work, and lots of handicap wheel chair services at airports and train stations which made it possible in my weakened condition. In October we headed out to Budapest to take advantage of the baths for my arm and Bratsvailia in Slovakia, but the weather had turned very cold and rainy, so we didn't stay long. We wanted to get to Barcelona to the sun, warmth and an indoor pool, sauna and Jacuzzi to help my arm. Instead our RV died in the middle of no where, but luckily in Austria, next to a McDonald's and 500 meters from a Ford dealer!

November brought blissful days in Barcelona, just relaxing, healing, swimming and locating our winter rental in southern Spain. Then more blissful days in the healing waters (from Roman times) at a spa that is our stopping point between Barcelona and Granada.

December has us back in

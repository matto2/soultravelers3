One recurring complaint that I hear from my friends about their international school experience was that they all felt they missed out on what their host country had to offer.  Some even have regrets and bitterness because they were not able to enjoy the beauty and the uniqueness of their host culture.  
  
Sometimes they feel ashamed because they cannot speak the local language or master the culture even though they have spent decades in the host country.  
  
What they call the "bubble" in which they float in for the years spent in international schools, have kept these people secluded from the outside world.  
Depending on the area they live in, whether or not they use public transportation or if they take part in activities outside school, some children might never get the slightest contact with locals and the respective culture.  
  
Very often children pick up the languages they use at school with their friends and by the time they reach teenage, influence from friends become a major factor in the way they build their identity.  
  
Choice of school is then a major dilemma and can be very strategical.  
  
They come from upper-middle class to upper class families.  
  
The cost is a determinant factor in keeping lower-middle class families from enrolling their children in international schools.  
  
As a result, our children might end up thinking that everybody in the world travels to paradise destinations three times a year, have a pool, and live in a 300 meters square apartment. It can be hard to teach them the value of money or the importance of hard-work in such environment.  
  
All the sad but unavoidable realities of our world will barely ever cross path with our children.  As they float in a bubble, away from these harsh truth of life, they stay naive or self-centered longer than other children.  
  
it is easy to imagine how easily our children can loose touch with the real world and hold a distorted view of basic concepts like work, money or generosity and contribution.  
  
Once they go to international schools, they will never feel they belong to one specific culture, and one only.  Instead they will identify themselves to other people with multicultural exposure and global skills. As they grow their ability to understand and appreciate diversity and inclusiveness they also build an international capital and become "third culture kids".  
   

> In summarizing that which we had observed in our cross-cultural encounters, we began to use the term "third culture" as a generic term to cover the styles of life created, shared, and learned by persons who are in the process of relating their societies, or sections thereof, to each other. The term "Third Culture Kids" or TCKs was coined to refer to the children who accompany their parents into another society.

This means that there is no going back, our choice as parents has a major impact: it catapults them in a community of people who hold several passports, speak many languages and travel all over the world every year.  
Most likely they will pursue an international career and might marry somebody from a different culture.  
  
If your plan is to settle down in a nice place in few years and re-become "local", be ready to see your children fly away as soon as they can. They will seek places and people they feel they belong with and it will certainly not be a mono-cultural place with "locals" only. 

A special thank you to Remi Iijima who kindly shared her master thesis ( BECOMING CULTURAL MEDIATORS: GLOBAL CULTURAL CAPITAL OF INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL ALUMNI IN TOKYO ). Thanks to her research I could understand better some subtle aspects of the subject

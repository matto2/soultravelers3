Penang is often called "The Pearl of the Orient" and the center of the pearl is Georgetown which is a UNESCO Heritage Site. Penang has a rich history,  with connections with China before the 15th century and being a British colony for over a century. It was originally named Prince of Wales Island and Georgetown was named after King George III ( as it was the first British trading post in the Far East).  
  
It has the largest population of Chinese than any other state in Malaysia and a large Indian population, not to mention Malays and many other nationalities ( primarily Asian). Thus walking around Georgetown is always an entertaining adventure with lots of unique eye candy to catch your attention or to  grab a photo.  
  
DaVinci has started a collection of rickshaw photos to capture and keep a record of some of the sights that delight us. Have you been to Penang? What was your favorite part?

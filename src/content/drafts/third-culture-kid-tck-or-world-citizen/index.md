Is TCK or Third Culture Kid a myth today? Does a term coined in the 50's for military brats, missionary kids and diplomats have any bearing at all on today's  globetrotting, world schooling, multilingual world citizen kids?  
  
"My country is the world, all men are my brethren and my religion is to do good." Thomas Paine"  
  
"To us all towns are one, all men our kin"  Poongundran  
  
For many reasons I think  there is no comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges. Today, thanks to tech and global culture,  we live in a very different world and a free spirit life or a permanent vacation, led by following one's bliss with many "homes" to repeatedly return to,  is TOTALLY different than growing up in the military, foreign service, missionary or large corporation funding and controlling the world travel.  
  
There is even much doubt about the term and research about TCK's. some international sociologists are critical of the research that "expects there to be one unified 'true' culture that is shared by all who have experiences of growing up overseas".[\[3\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid#cite_note-Hymlo196-2) through self-identification, [scientific sampling methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method") on adults may contain [bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascertainment_bias "Ascertainment bias") due to the difficulty in conducting [epidemiological](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology "Epidemiology") [studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological_study "Epidemiological study") across broad-based [population samples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28statistics%29 "Sampling (statistics)").  
  
  
TCKs are highly adaptive and develop excellent interpersonal and intercultural skills due to their ability to observe and human behavioral norms.

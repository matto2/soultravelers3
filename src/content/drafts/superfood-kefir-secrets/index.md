## **What is A Second Fermentation?**

The first fermentation takes place when you add your milk kefir grains to milk and allow it to culture for 12-24 hours. You then strain off the grains, add them to new milk, and are left with milk kefir.

Since you have removed the mother culture (the grains) you can now play with the cultured milk kefir without risking harm to the original culture. So a second fermentation is when fresh milk kefir is cultured for another period of 8-12 hours with possible flavoring additions.

Simply pour your fresh kefir into a sealable jar, add whatever flavorful additions you wish, and allow to culture for another 12-24 hours before refrigerating.

## What are the Flavor Benefits of a Second Fermentation?

Some people perform a second fermentation on their milk kefir for the health benefits, which we will get to in a minute. Others do it for the improvement in flavor.

Fermenting the kefir a second time, no matter the additions, mellows the kefir and takes away some of the sharp acidic flavor milk kefir is known for. Not only that, but with the addition of other flavorings you can spice, sweeten, or savor-up that kefir even more.

## What are the Other Benefits of a Second Fermentation?

There is no denying the “good feeling” one gets when drinking milk kefir. In fact, the name kefir literally means “good feeling”. But many people are finding that the benefits are increased even more when a second fermentation is performed.

B vitamins are said to increase and the minerals calcium and magnesium are said to become more bio-available to the human body when a second fermentation is performed.

## What Flavor Additions Can I Make in the Second Fermentation?

The good news is that the sky is the limit! Because the kefir grains are removed before the second fermentation there is no risk of a contaminating or harming your kefir grains in any ways.

**Here are some ideas:**

- Citrus fruit peels
- Vanilla + cinnamon
- Cocoa powder
- Garlic or onion (for use in savory kefir dip)
- Pumpkin pie spice
- Chopped fruit

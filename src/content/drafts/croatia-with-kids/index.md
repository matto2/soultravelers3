Croatia is a fantastic place for famly travel and the kids and the parents will both love it. We spent several months there one summer during our open ended family world trip and had a ball.  
  
Recently someone asked me for advice about a vacation to Croatia with children and I thought I should pass the Croatian tips onto you too.

DUBROVNIK

Â We stayed at an amazing place there for a month...that both parents and kid loved. We stayed at a place near the center that had 4 hotels, a campsite and rentals with every convenience from beaches, pools and kids club. A heavenly spot for every taste and budget

Dubrovnik is by far the prettiest city in Croatia loaded with history, Walking the walls is a must and fun for the whole family:

DAY TRIP TO MONTENEGRO

Also you can take a day trip from there to Montenegro which is fabulous:

VISIT SPLIT FOR HARBOR AND DIOCLETIA PALACE  
  
I also wasn't as thrilled with Spit, but the harbor is nice and the Diocletia palace unique:

NEARBY TROGIR IS A BETTER PLACE TO STAY  
  
Nearby Trogir is a better bet for families in my opinion and the Old Town is another UNESCO World Heritage site.

ISTRIA, DON'T MISS ROVINJ  
  
Rovinj is also a must see:

Plitvice Park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site not to miss :

I would also do some island hopping which gives one a real feel for the culture and easy to do by Ferry from Split or Dubrovnik ( Hvar and Korcula are both special in different ways):

You will run into some crowds as it is the busy season, but the warm weather season is short, so a good time to go if you plan carefully.

Lascaux & Prehistoric Park

<!--more-->

What kid doesn't love Prehistoric stories and caves? Family travel is at it's best when it combines education along with  fun in nature and the prehistoric opportunities make this area of the Dordogne a perfect spot to explore. Some of the world's most impressive cave art were discovered here in 1940 and the area where we stayed is called "the cradle of mankind". Archeologists have found dozens of prehistoric cave paintings and living sites in this area.  
  
Unfortunately, just like Alta Mira in Spain,  bacteria and algae from visitors started to destroy the paintings, so the original Lascaux cave is closed. The good news is they have a wonderfully done replica called Lascaux II and they do excellent  tours in many languages.  I only got a 2 pictures of the tour before I was told cameras were not allowed, but you can see more here and I have some of the outside.  
  
One can go to the Muse National de la Prehistoire , Musee de Speleologie and the Prehistoric Museum.  We found several books for Mozart including  "Nun the cave boy" and "gumbi and the time of polished rock" ( bought one at Alta Mira and one at Lascaux) which she enjoyed.

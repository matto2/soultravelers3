Shhh, don't tell anyone, but this is one of my favorite family low-budget secrets in Europe during high season. This is one of the cheapest campsites in Europe during July and August when even camping resorts can get expensive and most of Europe is on vacation.  
  
As you can see, there are no crowds and plenty of shades, two things much needed in the heigth of summer in Europe. Plus there is a restaurant, free wifi, near good transportation, great bathrooms and showers etc.

In my post [_Tiger's Nest in Paro, Bhutan_](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html#more "Tiger's Nest in Paro, Bhutan"),  a reader asked, "So is [Bhutan the happiest place](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-travel-bhutan-nomads.html "family travel bhutan") on earth? In the Geography of Bliss it leaves one eager to find out!"  
  
I loved this 60 minutes show on [Bhutan and the pursuit of happiness](http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/stories/liambartlett/574370/the-pursuit-of-happiness "Bhutan and the pursuit of happiness") and think it answers some of the question and gives a nice [glimpse of Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/bhutan-travel-mother-and-child-photo.html "glimse of Bhutan") and that vast changes going on there now.  
  
This photo was taken while my husband and 10 year old child climbed to the top of the Tiger's Nest with our beautiful-hearted  guide. I toured nearby areas with our sweet driver that I will write about soon.  We don't usually travel with a guide and driver, but they were a truly wonderful part of our journey.  
  
I snapped this top photo spontaneously and candidly as our driver came upon  a friend on our trek and they stopped to chat. I think you can see how the happiness shines out from them in this simple every day moment.

**Our driver and guide taught us much about Bhutan, Buddhism and happiness.**  
  
We spent a lot of time with this driver and our guide, two wonderful Bhutanese young men and we were deeply  touched by their ferocious devotion to their religion and how that resulting compassion and kindness spilled out and affected everything they did.

Is Bhutan the happiest place on earth? I don't know, but I think the whole world could learn a lot from the Bhutanese and their wise king who said "Gross national happiness is more important that gross national product".

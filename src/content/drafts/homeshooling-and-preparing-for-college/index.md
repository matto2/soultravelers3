More than half of Americans are [dissatisfied with American public education](http://www.gallup.com/poll/156974/private-schools-top-marks-educating-children.aspx?utm_source=alert&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=syndication&utm_content=morelink&utm_term=All),

easier for homeschooled children to earn college credit inexpensively using online community college courses and CLEP/DSST Examinations. My three oldest homeschooled children all had over one semester of college when they graduated from homeschool; with one of them earning an AA when she was 17  
  
Stanford, Northwestern, U. Miami, and U. Nebraska all have accredited online high schools that cater both to HSers, and to kids pursuing time-intensive paths in the arts or sports.  
  
teens rack up massive amounts of college credit instead of waiting for high school graduation  
  
Most teens are more than smart enough to pass CLEP exams or other college credit options. Leaving high school with your first, second, third, and even ENTIRE college degree is possible,  
  
I couldn't have differentiated myself from the rest of the high achieving seniors if I had stayed in the petri dish with them. There are as many valedictorians as there are high schools, but how many high school kids can write an essay about their solo round-the-world trip and show three years of A's in college classes  
  
The best advantage to being home-schooled is that the parents can make the school day so efficient, engaging, interesting, and fun, the day could end at 12 or 1 pm and the students can simply maximize their learning without a school bureaucracy.  
  
I don't have all the answers, but I do know her heart is what is most important to us

deeply concerned for my daughters growing up in a culture where 25% of women aged 18-34 would rather win "America's Next Top Model" than the Nobel Peace Prize, 22% would rather lose the ability to read than their figures, and half consider "becoming famous" their first or second most important life goal. Yikes!

They know how to self-organize and trust their analytical abilities because they never 'failed' when they made mistakes - they just learned to self-correct and move on, fearlessly. They trust their intuition because they trust themselves, because their environment/home has trusted their choices. Above all, they are relaxed and delightfully creative in their endeavors, again because they have not been judged/evaluated and graded by someone who probably couldn't have accomplished what they did in any case.

"There is no separation between living and learning. Life is just the curriculum. Learning is our path through it." Joyce Reed  
  
What really matters is far beyond the three Rs.  educational, emotional, psychological, spiritual, and cultural aspects of what we desire for our children’s future as contributing members of a community and society.  
  
homeschooling (and all its variations and subsets) is not really a method of education – or, it is, but it’s also much more. There are no standardized step-by-step guidelines or rules for doing it the right way, because every child and every family is different. Homeschooling is a way of life, a way of looking at the world and at children. It is about self-direction, about learning from life and throughout life. It is about kids, families and communities regaining control over their days, their learning, their money, their resources and their ability to direct and manage themselves

American universities are the best in the world—22 out of the world’s top 30, according to the Graduate School of Education at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am concerned about young students who are being prodded to find and focus on what they are going to do to earn a living five, eight, even ten years down the road. A

Another thing being lost in our society today is kids having time to figure out who they are and what their passions are in life. I love how she shows that the kids can pursue their own interests and figure out what they love to do and what their gifts are because they have the time to do it.  
  
Have you heard the old proverb which says that if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day, but if you teach him how to fish you feed him for a lifetime? That same principle applies to education in general. Either we can spoon-feed kids facts which will last until they regurgitate them on a test or we can teach them how to learn on their own.  
  
Didn't poet William Butler Yeats say that education is not the filling of a bucket but the lighting of a fire? This is an idea that many homeschooling parents have learned and seek to implement in their home education  
right conditions--supportive parents, self-motivation and a thirst to pursue new interests- 
self-mastery, then a mastery mindset, and finally self-teaching  
  
Since 1999, the number of children who are being homeschooled has increased by 75% Although currently only 4% of all school children nationwide are educated at home,  
  
Any concerns expressed about the quality of education offered to the kids by their parents can surely be put to rest by the consistently high placement of homeschooled kids on standardized assessment exams. Data shows that those who are independently educated typically score between 65th and 89th percentile on such exams, while those attending traditional schools average on the 50th percentile.  
  
Recent studies laud homeschoolers’ academic success, noting their significantly higher ACT-Composite scores as high schoolers and higher grade point averages as college students. Yet surprisingly, the average expenditure for the education of a homeschooled child, per year, is $500 to $600, compared to an average expenditure of $10,000 per child, per year, for public school students.  
  
Homeschoolers are actively recruited by schools like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Stanford University and Duke.n  
  
Dartmouth College admissions officer recognizing, "The applications \[from homeschoolers\] I've come across are outstanding. Homeschoolers have a distinct advantage because of the individualized instruction they have received."  
  
Research and probability indicates that homeschooled students typically do very well in college, not just academically, but socially as well. Skills learned in homeschooling translate very well to the college campus, with strong self-discipline and motivation. Colleges recognize this advantage, including Brown University representative Joyce Reed, who shares, "These kids are the epitome of Brown students." She believes they make a good fit with the university because "they've learned to be self-directed, they take risks, they face challenges with total fervor, and they don't back off."  
  
Homeschooled students are able to work at their own pace, and as a result, students have the freedom to move significantly faster than those in a traditional classroom.homeschool students typically earn more college credits before their freshman year than traditional students ( averaging more than twice as much).  
  
In the fall of 1999, Stanford University accepted 27% of homeschooled applicants. This doesn't sound like a lot, but it's an incredible number when you consider that this rate is twice the acceptance rate experienced by public and private school students admitted in the same semester.  
  
fact, homeschoolers are now in over 900 different colleges and universities, many of them with rigorous admissions. Some of these colleges include Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, Dartmouth, Brown, and Rice University.  
  
more structured academic environment  
  
Among homeschoolers who end up at Stanford, "self-teaching" is a common thread. Parents usually teach in the early grades, assigning and correcting work, but later shift to a supervisory role, spending more time tracking down books and mentors. Stanford-bound homeschoolers typically take several college courses before they apply. The admission office encourages this, both to help with evaluation and to give students a taste of classroom learning before they arrive on the Farm.  
  
Stanford's current homeschoolers aren't the first to reach top-tier institutions. The poster children of the movement were the sons of Micki and David Colfax, two former teachers who raised their children on a goat farm in Northern California's Mendocino County. During the 1980s, three Colfax boys headed off, in succession, to Harvard. Their admittance created a national media sensation.  
  
believes the very nature of homeschooling--requiring kids to be self-driven and to handle the details of their own education--can give these students an edge as freshmen  
  
"It's not, 'I'm free now--I'm going to go to college and party,'" Dobson says. "These kids know what it's like to handle responsibility."  
  
any public school teacher has a class of 20 or so students on average, and does not have time to work with individual children. This means that some move ahead quicker than others. The inevitable effect is that some children do not achieve mastery. If the children are learning arithmetic, some of them get it quickly and become bored, and others struggle.  
  
Regardless of where the individual students are, the whole classroom of 20 must move forward according to the day's curriculum. This results in frustration for those who haven't mastered the subject, and boredom for those who master it quickly. The frustration compounds itself because most subjects are cumulative. In other words, if you have not mastered double digit addition, you will be unable to do double digit subtraction; the processes are related. The deficit accumulates until the kid gives up and says "I'm not interested in math; I can't do math."  
  
My husband and I desire to train our children's hearts first and foremost, and then the educational pieces of the puzzle will fall into place." And the results? "We've raised our young children with a distinctive worldview that will enable them as adults to hold to those values and thrive amidst a culture which tends to make destructive choices."  
  
Even if not any smarter than the average kid in public school, they're smart enough to learn at a faster pace than the public schools. Public schools have a tremendous amount of wasted time built into the day: time to transition between classes, time traveling to and from school, and time in the classroom at the end of the period when the slower students are finishing work, as the quicker students are sitting bored, chatting, giggling and fiddling with whatever electronic gadgets they have smuggled into the classroom.  
A homeschooling education is vastly more efficient in its use of time.  
  
Functional, effective adults are people who continue to learn, on their own, without anybody to correct them as they go.  
Once the children are in the habit of teaching themselves, you find that they can teach themselves things that you the parent don't know. In fact, to your delight, you can probably let them teach you things that you wish you knew  
  
empowers the child to do their own research. To look for mentors, to build bridges into the adult world. They are not trapped into the passive role of the students when they should be coming should be growing into the role of active, results-oriented adults.

" A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both." Chateaubriand

_triple forces of demographic change, economic globalization, and technological innovation toward ever more demanding requirements for educational improvement in our schools.

More than 2 million U.S. students in grades K-12 were home-schooled in 2010, accounting for nearly 4 percent of all school-aged children, according to the [National Home Education Research Institute](http://www.nheri.org/). Studies suggest that those who go on to college will outperform their peers.  
  
Students coming from a home school graduated college at a higher rate than their peers­—66.7 percent compared to 57.5 percent—and earned higher grade point averages along the way, [according to a study](http://i.bnet.com/blogs/homeschool.pdf) that compared students at one doctoral university from 2004-2009. 
  
ut a lifetime of "unschooling" can make it hard to embrace a structured institution like Stanford. a worry often cited by critics of homeschooling. Can these students learn to live with the rules of the larger world? Are they properly socialized?  
  

Backing her up is a 1999 survey organized by Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute. Ray found that the typical homeschooler takes part in at least five social activities outside the home every week--from dance classes and sports teams to scout troops and community theater. He also collected previous findings by educators and psychologists suggesting that children taught at home are actually socially and emotionally healthier than those in schools. They are more comfortable interacting with adults and less likely to pin their self-esteem to the fads and whims of teenagers, Ray says.

The way these youngsters learn social skills--modeling themselves after adults rather than peers--is more consistent with the way children have been socialized through most of history, Esther Baruch asserts. "Until about a hundred years ago, the rich kids learned from adult tutors, and poor kids went to work early," she says. "Now, \[kids in schools\] model themselves after the other kids, who model themselves after tv characters--and the results of that are clear."

  
  
showing all the kinds of things that colleges are looking for—curiosity, confidence, resourcefulness, ability to deal with challenges—you name it. That's a part of being a home-schooled student."  
  
Home-schooled students often spend less time in class, Kelly says, giving them more opportunity to get out into the world and engage with adults and teens alike.  
  
"The flexibility that home-schooling gives you, you can leverage that into getting all sorts of opportunities," he says. "Seize the day by using home-schooling as a springboard to college admissions." Orlowski ( MIT physics student who was homeschooled)  
  
discussing current events, what's going on in the world, a problem that needs a creative solution or an article you have read. Do this when you're with the kids in the car, standing in lines, sitting in restaurants waiting for food, or while you're on the way to Grandma's house.

Our children will enter jobs that don't even exist today. They will use new technology. Many of today's jobs will be outsourced and automated. What will allow our kids to compete in this uncertain future? Developing habits of mind, innovative thinking, communication and math skills is a good bet. They should be able to read critically, evaluate information, know where to find answers, solve problems, and collaborate with others. These skills won't be outdated.  
  
•You stay on top of your child’s educational needs!  
• With a good knowledge of your child’s abilities, you will be able to better counsel them on  
their plans!  
• Your student will stay SAFE!   
• You control peer group!  Psychologists say that peer influence increases from 20%in  
elementary school to 80% by the high school year  
• You control the moral and religious education!

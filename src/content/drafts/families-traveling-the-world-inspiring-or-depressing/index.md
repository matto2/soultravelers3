<!--more--> It is an understandable point of view, but I find it sad that she finds this post depressing instead of inspiring.  
  
One person working hard, overcoming much to live their dream does not mean that should depress others, but instead excite the possibilities for  ALL. ( Not just for travel or minimalism).  
  
“Those who say it can't be done are usually interrupted by others doing it.” Baldwin  
  
"The only rules and limits are those we set for ourselves" - Tim Ferriss  
  
Travel and minimalism may indeed be a privilege for much of the world, but the opportunities have NEVER been greater. Not everyone wants to do either, but for those that DO and value experiences, relations, time over "stuff"...MANY today are showing the way.  
  
Tech has made a HUGE change so that one can live, work, school ANY where today.  
  
One no longer has to buy the myth that travel is expensive and one has to be rich to live a rich life. When we sold everything and  started our open ended ,non-stop world travel in 2005/6, few resources were out there, now there are a  ton...including many families.  
  
We have been traveling the world as a family ( and very green, minimalist style) to 43 countries on 5 continents on just $23/day...going on 6 years now! (Yes, even expensive places like Bora Bora, Bhutan and Europe). I wrote this popular post on how to do extended travel full of valuable links and info:

We travel the world for MUCH cheaper than we lived at home. We are monolinguals raising a fluent as a native trilingual/triliterate ( Mandarin, Spanish, English) kid who speaks bits of many languages.  
  
We even tour the world with a piano and violin and are proponents of slow travel, slow living, sustainable living.  
  
In the last 12 months alone, we stopped in 26 airports, completely circumvented the globe with only one small carryon luggage each. Yet we happily experience most of the world at ground level by foot, bike or mass transit.  
  
It's true we are middle class folks, but we sacrificed and risked much to live this dream life. We lived well under our means for most of our lives.  
  
If you WANT to travel, almost any one can do this and truly if there is a will there is a way.  
  
My own brother traveled the world for many years without ANY money ( and he is not the only one to do that). True in less comfort and more risk than I would do ( like jumping on trains, sleeping outside) but that was his choice for freedom and extreme minimalism. He lived a happy and blessed life.  
  
A family with 8 kids on a low income managed to save for years for a 15 month tour of the world.Yes, they ate a lot of beans and rice,  but well worth it to them.   
  
A young Canadian woman who was inspired by our travels ( and who has adopted 5 mixed raced kids) saved and prepared for years and is now loving her travel lifestyle around Europe...kids,working online and all.  
  
The examples are endless...I have lists on my blog.  Look at FOTR ( families on the road) the Location Independent or Nunomad websites to begin.  
  
We're featured case studies in the mega hits 4Hour Workweek and Art of Non-Conformity and I suggest those and Ralph Potts Vagabonding or Maya Frost's New Global Student to open your mind to a new way of thinking.  
  
If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing, you're right.

"Time=Wealth. By far the most important lesson travel teaches you is that your time is all you really own in life."- Rolf Potts

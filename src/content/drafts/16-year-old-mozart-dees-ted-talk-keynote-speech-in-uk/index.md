Teen actress, songwriter, singer Mozart Dee was asked to do a TED Talk in the UK in December from an educator in London, Drew Buddie,  who has been fascinated with her traveling the world education and how growing up global has affected her. She was also filming a songwriting segment on MTV with Bebe Rexha at the same time, so she did it via Youtube and it was shared full screen with the TEDX audience in London.

Being raised around the world traveling as a world-schooled global nomad to 48 countries for the last 11 years, literally using the world as her classroom. has given Mozart a unique perspective. Thus she has been a popular and award-winning keynote speaker for a variety of audiences and international venues from Beijing to Barcelona starting at 8 years old, including being the youngest reporter at New York Fashion Week at 13, a speaker in Dallas, the youngest Keynote Speaker at the [Global Education Conference](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "Mozart Dee youngest speaker at Global Education Conference") and the youngest [Keynote Speaker at the NAACE Educators Conference](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2015/05/teen-singer-mozarts-speech-at-naace-conference-to-uk-educators.html "youngest keynote speaker at NAACE Educators Conference ") at 14.

We took a [day cruise](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html) there last year and loved the sights along the way like this castle. It is fun because you can bring your bikes with you on the Danube river cruise ship and get off at various places and explore. So many great places like the famous [abbey at Melk](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/prettiest-church-in-the-world-melk-abbey-austria-european-golden-beauty-on-danube-in-wine-country-.html) and the [beautiful](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/family-travel-photo-austria-melk-joy-in-water.html) grounds there.  
  
I've got lots more to share about this area, but thought you'd love this photo. I've forgotten what the name of this castle is as there are many castles along the route  and although they told us about each one as we went by, there is no way to remember them all. We saw some close up and in detail, but just viewing this one from the boat was enough pleasure.

  Psssst. We know the best family travel secret in Bordeaux! Forget about a hotel and have a ball in this enchanting,  luxury campsite set in the middle of beautiful Bordeaux vineyards just a short bike ride or walk from St Emilion. This was one of our favorite [campgrounds](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14855324) so far.

Not as fancy as [Chianti hills](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html), or as big as [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html), [Venice](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/italian-memoria.html#more) , [the Algarve in Portuga](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/beauty-and-nake.html)l or [Florence,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/02/snow-in-florenc.html#more) but with every convenience and endless charm. It is called [Domaine de la Barbanne](http://www.select-site.com/campsites/overview.cfm?mc=590&regionID=869) and they have 150 camping sites, along with cabins for those who don't camp, a lovely restaurant and store, plus 2 pools, tennis courts, a small lake with ducks, fishing, playground, mini golf, rental bikes and more. We were there in late June and early July and there were no crowds, but the weather was pleasant.

If you do camp in an RV or Caravan, the pitches are large and private. DaVinci enjoyed doing a little barbeque and Mozart was happy to meet a new friend from Scotland who she played a lot with. The kids absolutely adored the ducks in the lake, swimming in the great pools ( one had a fun slide ) surrounded by vineyard views and biking around the campsite and the small vineyard roads all around.

It really was a [Bordeaux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux) family travel fantasy come true and I can't recommend it high enough. I think [our video of our time there](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jYiqGE2VjQ&feature=channel_page) says it all, but I'll add some more pictures. We heard the restaurant on the property was excellent and good value, but we never got around to trying it out. I really can not imagine that any place, no hotel or rental, could compete with all this place had to offer for families. To top that off, the prices were excellent and a bargain compared to anything else near by.

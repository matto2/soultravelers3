Do your kids love math? I think parental influence makes a huge difference in things like reading, math and sciences and [many studies](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080527123852.htm "studies show parental influences child's education") show that.Â  I think it is a good sign, when your kid makes a heart on her math notebook on her own violition, so this made me smile.  
  
Mozart has always loved learning and besides teaching herself to read at two, she had an interest in math and was extremely good at puzzles as a baby. I know she was not yet two when we visited a local Montessori school and they were quite amazed that she  
  
Interestingly math is a bit different in Spain and also different in Asia...different from each other and with the USA. Funny, but kidlet adjusts quickly as it is not that different and she is gifted in math, so it all comes easy to her. ( My brothers were fab at math too, but I am not, so I found Singapore through research..VERY popular with gifted kids because it doesn't have a lot of rote ..but hubs teaches it because he is also a whiz at math).  
  
I think most of the math instruction in USA schools is very poor compared to Asia ( and other countries) and one can see that with international test scores.The USA tends to use too much drill-and-kill curriculum..so most kids never learn the important conceptual part...even good students tend to just learn tricks for the test, but often don't have good real world problem solving abilities...because drill and kill doesn't do that.  
  
Singapore students are almost always at the top in mathematics in every international competition, so I figure their curric is the best...at least for our kid.  
  
The emphasis in Singapore is on deep conceptual knowledge of mathematical concepts, rather than learning by rote..that makes all the difference for us. Unlike American math books, the Singapore textbooks and workbooks are thin and lightweight ( cheap and portable) and address fewer topics per year with depth and coherence. They are also very kid friendly with simple cartoon drawings that highlighted important mathematical ideas  
  
They don't waste time with mind-numbing repetition...essential for a kid who grasps concepts quickly and doesn't need the drill. Singapore math does not repeat concepts. You learn a concept, then move on or build on it.  
  
Singaporean fifth grade textbooks, for example, are comparable in rigor to U.S. sixth, seventh, and even eighth grade (or so-called "Algebra I") textbooks.  
  
Singapore math also encourages students to do problems in their heads, to talk them out, and to draw visual representations of the problem..building the foundation for higher math from preschool on..they start doing some algebra in 4th grade. Word problems are introduced from the beginning and get gradually more sophisticated.  
  
Unlike the "spiral approach" used in most US math books, where only one concept is used at a time, then dropped for a year until it is done in almost exactly the same way again, the Singapore books use what has been previously learned continuously. The multiplication sections will have multi-step word problems that require addition and subtraction as well as multiplication.  
  
She has always been far ahead of the math in her schools in Spain and here as well ( despite the 3 year skip) so we continue with the singapore even while in school...but slower..mainly just a bit on weekends. It is harder here than in Spain ( but a higher grade as well).  
  
She enjoys math and is good at it, but it is not one of her passions. Like most things, we just wanted to give her a good foundation and think this does it welll..but hubs also does other things with her in math and they discuss it, play games etc ( and i have always bought her fun math books to help as well like the number devil or phantom tollbooth etc  
  
How one teaches math is probably up to the kid..but this works well for us and tends to be a great program for gifted kids in math.  
  
A funny side note is when we first started doing singapore math ..when she was 3 I think and ready for their early books...we would laugh at the funny kids names in the books word problems ( they were actually used in Singapore schools).  
  
NOW we KNOW kids with these odd names! ;) AND that seems perfectly normal. ( Some of the kids here have English names and then their real names in Chinese, Korean etc but most go by their unusal to our ear, Asian names.

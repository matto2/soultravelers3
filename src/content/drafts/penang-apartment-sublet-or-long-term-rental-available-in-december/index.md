**GREAT APARTMENT AVAILABLE IN PENANG**  
  
We've been wintering in Penang for a few years for kiddo's [Mandarin fluency](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "Mandarin fluency") and love the tropical weather, friendly people, [organic food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/where-to-buy-organic-food-in-penang.html "organic food in Penang") and [cheap cost of living](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "cheap cost of living Penang"), but we are leaving now in Mid - December. Would you like to sublet our place?

**ONE OF THE BEST AT GREAT PRICE**  
  
We've lived in a few different places in Penang and have looked at tons from Batu Ferringhi to Geogetown and this has been one of our favorites because it feels like a home and like a quiet oasis, but within walking distance to all services.

**IN TANJUNG TOKONG - CLOSE TO EVERYTHING**  
  
It is very centrally located in Tanjung Tokong ( our favorite area)  and just 2 blocks walking distance to a new Tesco store, and Island Plaza in the other direction. There is a very popular restaurant next door if you love the local food and many others nearby, plus a bus stop just outside the gate. It's just ten minutes bus ride from the big shopping mall at Gurney Plaza,  walkable to Straits Quay and the beach and about 10 minutes drive by car to downtown Georgetown.

**SEA VIEWS FROM EVERY ROOM**  
  
The apartment is bright, beautiful, clean, modern and has been extremely well kept. It has Andaman sea views from every room. I love it that one can see both the sunrise here over the sea from the bedrooms ( dark curtains if you are not early risers)  as well as the sunset over the mountains from the kitchen area and front door with balcony, every evening.   
  
Two large master bedrooms, plus a smaller one we use as an office, (great for kids or guests too), comfortable big beds, lots of storage space, high end kitchen things, good linens, washer, water filter, hot showers, bath tub, utility room and more.

It has a stunning night skyline view of Penang in the evening. I have so enjoyed the big kitchen as they are hard to find in Asia and kiddo has loved the flat screen TV and DVD player for family movies on the weekends.

The apartment is on the 16th floor, which allows for a cool breeze all of the time, keeps things quiet and no worries about mosquitoes. There is air conditioning in all the rooms, but we almost never use it.  
  
[![penang apartment for rent - night view](http://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a95078833019b01d6af29970b-800wi "penang apartment for rent - night view")](http://soultravelers3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a95078833019b01d6af29970b-pi)  
  
  
The apartment building is very, very quiet  and well maintained. The grounds are nicely landscaped and well kept. There is a pool, fitness center and squash court. There is security 24/7 and the management is very responsive.

The owner of this unit is very kind and responsive as well and keeps her tenants happy. It is a priority with her. She is a Christian and local who is a lawyer, married to a doctor and has two children who are doctors. Most of the people in the building are similar professionals.

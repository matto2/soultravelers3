<!--more--> Can world travel be the best education? Based on 7 years of non-stop travel, I think so and I've written about the benefits of travel, learning while traveling, and xxxx. Certainly, as monolingual parents,  raising our child as a fluent multilingual through travel is one of the great lessons.  
  
But, I am amazed at how much we, and especially our daughter has learned from travel just through different transportation methods. Is it surprising that during these 7 years to 44 countries on 5 continents, that we have walked more than any other mode? We love seeing the world at ground level and cherish the benefits of  slow travel, ( which means no travel burnout)  but every method has taught us important things.

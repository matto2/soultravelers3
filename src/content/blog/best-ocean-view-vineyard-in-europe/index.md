 We loved our first months long [family road trip to Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/we-love-dubrovn.html) in 2007.So we were thrilled to do a month long empty nest [couples road trip in Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/10/road-trip-croatia-montenegro.html#more) last fall. Fantastic to see again the places we loved and find new places and vineyards to [explore in Croatia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/croatia/index.html).

I finally have the time to write about these wonderful experiences in [Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/croatian-island.html). I will be doing a whole series on [vineyards](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/06/santorini-wine.html) and [wine tasting](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/wine-roads-bacc.html) in Croatia.

We were thrilled to discover the magnificent Royal Vineyards ( Kraljevski vinogradi). I have never seen a more beautiful location with sea views & 300,000 vines! Paralleling to the Adriatic sea view are the rugged Dinaric Alps, whose geology helps make for remarkably clear seawater and distant islands to view.

The Royal Vineyards are located only 12 kilometers from the beautiful, [historical city of Zadar](https://www.roughguides.com/article/why-you-need-to-visit-zadar-croatia/) and just 20km from Bibinje where we stayed on the beach.The vineyards are situated on twenty five acres of land & are almost nine centuries old.

The history began when the Croatian King Petar Krešimir IV, donated a large piece of land on the slopes above the [town of Petrčan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrčane)e near Zadar to the Benedictine monastery of St. Mary in Zadar. One of the nuns in the monastery decided to convert the land to a vineyard.

Visitors can find delicious wine tasting inside and outside. Plus a tavern with Croatian food with stunning views of Zadar, the picturesque town of Petrčane and 22 islands of the thrilling Zadar archipelago. Truly, one of the most dazzling locations of northern Dalmatia and the world. We were awestruck before even tasting the wine!

Perhaps we are a bit prejudiced because we had our own organic  [Pinot Noir vineyard](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "our pinot noir vineyard") that we grew from scratch and hubby  [Designer Gar Reyna](https://www.garreynadesign.com) has long been a wine connoisseur. We enjoy vineyards as much as the wine. He was friends with [David Bruce](https://www.davidbrucewinery.com) and did design work for their winery. Like our daughter [Heavenly](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com), Gar grew up on a vineyard, so that fond memory was planted early.

"Although all of the wines from the Royal Vineyards, both red and white, have won over wine lovers, the Pošip grape variety from this winery charms true wine connoisseurs the most. This variety is widespread throughout Dalmatia, and it is a dry wine with a unique taste and aromas of apricot, fig, and a liquid image of the Mediterranean and Dalmatia, which has gained a new face in the Royal Vineyards. It is an ideal accompaniment to fish dishes, white, lighter meat, and cheeses."

So that is one of many ways to enjoy this vineyard. They also do special cooking classes and allow people to participate in the harvest.

They also do weddings here. I think perhaps one took place shortly before our visit as there were still decorations on the vines. What an amazing spot to do a destination wedding or family gathering.

One can adore the daily mind-blowing sunsets at this vineyard. Or bring a bottle and enjoy in Zadar. Or in Bibinje. Every evening we were there, the show was astounding. It was my favorite part of this area. Which is saying a lot as there is so much to enjoy.

Leave the time to really soak in this special place. Whether you go during the day, or sunset,  by bike or car or tour, you will be impressed.

Willow tree, the color red, misty morning and shimmering reflection of [Beijing houses](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/real-beijing-hutong-nights.html#more "beijing houses in hutong") on a still river makes an idyllic oriental scene as peaceful as a painting.  
  
This view caught my eye in a parking lot and I had to stop to take it before jumping into a cab. Between the hustle and bustle of high rise, [modern Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/yum-loving-the-food-in-beijing.html "modern Beijing food "), there are little pockets like this that remind me of [old Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/china-bridge-summer-palace.html#more "old beijing") and [life in China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html#more "life in China - travel ") before all the growth.  
  
They make me smile, how about you?

There is sooooo much to love about the Luberon and many call it the most beautiful part of Provence. It so appealed to us that we talked to a real estate agent and got her card and a magazine with beautiful homes for sale to look over. We will be back here for an extended stay to know it better, probably spend a winter here at some point as our friend Kathy Woods of the Luberon experience did with her family. We have always wanted to spend more time in Provence and their experiences have inspired us and given us some solid been-there-done-that advice.

We are sorry we did not connect with two people we know who live in this area or see all the sites that we would have liked to,but we know we will be back. We were glad to see it off season and thrilled that the weather was sunny and sublime for our short visit. We just got a little taste this time, but more than enough to know that we will be back. Visions of this beauty continue to dance in our heads and will stay with us forever.

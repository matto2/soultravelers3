Ah, the greens of Ireland! I love this photo that DaVinci took when we visited the famous sacred spot, [Rock of Cashel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_of_Cashel) when we were in Ireland the last summer. We were amazed that July and August in the four [British Isles](http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/britain_01.shtml) were colder than the winter in [Andalusia Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/01/white-xmas-sort.html), but you sure can't beat the green colors all around. As we enjoy the leisurely sunny days in [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/top-10-costa-brava-secret-gems-spain.html) and Italy this summer, we are reminded about how diverse the weather can be in Europe.

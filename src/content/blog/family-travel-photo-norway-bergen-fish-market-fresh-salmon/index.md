Have you ever tried smoked whale? Family travel is sometimes about trying new foods in exciting places and the [colorful fish marke](http://www.bergen-guide.com/40.htm)t in [Bergen, Norway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen) did not disappoint! We splurged on some scrumptious natural smoked salmon and tasted the whale, but decided a taste was more than enough for us.

Norway is the [most expensive country](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-92633816.html) in Europe, but it is possible to do on a small  budget. It is a beautiful country and the [fjords are spectacular](http://www.fjords.com/), so well worth seeing. Bergen is one of the prettiest small cities in Europe and the fish market is a popular spot. This fellow was very friendly and we took our goodies and had a divine picnic nearby, charmed by the sailboats in the harbor and lovely architecture. 

We'll be writing more about our [travels in Norway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/family-travel-norway-in-a-nutshell-norwegian-fijord-photo.html) from last summer, but thought this "taste" would suffice for those waiting. What is the oddest thing you have eaten while traveling? Whale and [ox tail](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/el-caballo-rojo.html) are near the top of our list.

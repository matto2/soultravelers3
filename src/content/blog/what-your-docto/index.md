What Your Doctor May NOT Tell You  
About Children's Vaccinations  
Written by an MD who is an expert on pediatric  
vaccinations, this is an excellent book to help one  
make this very important and difficult decision.  
It is essential to get informed, even more so for  
families that travel. Travel clinics have a vested  
interest, so unlikely to give you the whole picture.  
This book is a good starting point. Sometimes the  
vaccine can be more harmful than theÂ  disease and  
there are many precautions a parent can take to  
make this a safer choice.

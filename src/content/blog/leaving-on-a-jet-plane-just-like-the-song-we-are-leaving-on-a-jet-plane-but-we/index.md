Just like the song, we are [leaving on a jet plane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_on_a_Jet_Plane "leaving on a jet plane"), but we know when we will be back. We're scheduled to fly out of Barcelona on Tuesday and we head to exotic and beautiful [Transylvania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania "transylvania") to find [Dracula's castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran_Castle "Dracula's castle") and explore the region with friends we met online.  
  
We've been invited to a baby christening in [enchanting Sibiu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibiu "vacation  Sibiu, Romania") and are looking forward to also exploring the [painted monasteries of Maldavia and Bucovina.](http://www.romanianmonasteries.org/bucovina/all-bucovina-monasteries "painted monasteries of Romania") I think we will soon have some amazing photos, videos and stories of rarely seen areas as well as [Unesco Heritage sites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Romania "Unesco world heritage sites in Romania").  
  
Then we are excited to celebrate our 20th [wedding anniversary](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "wedding anniversary Paris") at the end of August in [Budapest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/family-travel-budapest-hungary-family-friendly-fun-and-educational.html "budapest holiday"), one of the most beautiful cities in Europe at the amazing [Four Seasons Gresham Palace](http://www.fourseasons.com/budapest/ "Four Seasons Budapest").  
  
We had a fabulous time visiting in Barcelona with our [Swedish friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/funniest-kids-soultravelers3-family-travel-best-funny-youtube-global-kids-hilarious-sweden-trumpet-v.html "swedish friends"), well worth paying extra for high season here as that was the only time they could take off. Photos and stories coming.  
  
Alas I am still dealing with some digestive health issues and will write up the whole story soon and what I have learned along the way. Luckily I found an Acupuncturist here in Barcelona who seems to be helping. Keep us in your prayers as well as my Dad in Arizona who is in the hospital. Thanks!  
  
We will [return to Barelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "Barcelona  luxury camping") at the end of September to pack up and visit with our [Barcelona friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "Barcelona friends"), then store the RV here for the winter. We start our [USA road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "USA road trip") in Miami on September 14th, so we will have limited time online until November when we reach [Santa Cruz](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/homeaway-santa-cruz-beach-house-vacation-rental-review-best-family-friendly-lodging.html "santa cruz beach rental ").

We head back for another [winter inÂ  Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "winter in Asia") for more [Mandarin school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Mandarin school in Asia") the day after New Years, so you will probably see most of our Romania, Budapest, and American road trip stories after that date. I will get up what I can on the move.  
  
What are your travel plans?

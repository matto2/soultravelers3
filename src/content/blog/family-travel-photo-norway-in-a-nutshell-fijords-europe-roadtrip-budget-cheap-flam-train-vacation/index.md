[Family Travel in Norway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/family-travel-norway-in-a-nutshell-norwegian-fijord-photo.html) means not missing the [Fjords](http://www.fjordnorway.com/en/), famous [Flam](http://www.visitflam.com/default.asp) and [Bergen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-norway-bergen-fish-market-fresh-salmon.html) Railway and breathtaking scenery while doing [Norway in a Nutshell](http://www.norwaynutshell.com/) on a [bargain budget](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html). We are big proponents of [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html), but [Norway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-norway-oslo-vigeland-sculpture-park-mother-child.html) is the most expensive country in Europe, so one way to keep to a [tight family travel budget](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) while there is to see a lot in a short amount of time.

Thankfully, the  fantastic bus, [train](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/12/bergensnanen-free-download/), and [ferry](http://gudvangen.com/) connections between Oslo and  Norway's stunning, pristine fjord country make this [easy to do](http://www.ricksteves.com/plan/destinations/scan/fjords.htm). We found early September to be the perfect time to do this as the crowds are gone, but weather is still nice. 

We took this beautiful photo out our window while taking the fantastic, kid friendly and fun [Flam Railway](http://www.flaamsbana.no/eng/) and have much to share yet on this topic. [Writing our book](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html) and my [still paralyzed, slowly healing arm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html) has slowed me down a bit on the blog, but I will get to it as soon as I can.

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway):

"The west coast of southern Norway and the coast of northern Norway present some of the most visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world. [National Geographic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic "National Geographic") has listed the Norwegian fjords as the world's top tourist attraction."

Don't miss it!

What has been some of your favorite and impressive sceneries on your travels?

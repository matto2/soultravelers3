[Isn't this an adorable photo of two kids on a bike? One of the fabulous things about](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330177443b7012970d-150x150-1.jpg) [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "RTW world travel") is the serendipity that happens just wandering around a new place. This one was discovered [walking Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/walking-in-asia.html "walking Asia ") and [exploring Georgetown](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Exploring Georgetown, Malaysia") as we do our many errands and as we get to know typical [life in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "life in Asia").  
  
Living in our [rental vacation home in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "rental apartment or condo in Penang") is luxurious and the [malls are big](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/tropical-christmas-abroad-in-asia.html "mall in Penang") and almost [first world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/weird-asia.html "first world mall in 3rd world asia"), but when you see [Asia at the ground level](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "Asia local style") via walking and local buses, it's quite a sensory overloading gauntlet between the noise, wild traffic, no sidewalks or cross walks to speak of, [big rats](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/big-rats-in-asia.html "Big rats in Asia hawker stands"), cooking outside, [stores on bikes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/awesome-asian-coconut-rickshaw-photo.html "coconut store on bike asia"), smells, [cute funky restaurants](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/cutest-restaurant-in-asia.html "cute, funky restaurants") and [crowds](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/asian-local-cafe-style.html "Asia crowded cafe").  
  
I just discovered that this street art was done by a 25 year old Lithuanian named Ernest Zacharevic and he has a few works around [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "penang").  
  
This work of art, made us smile. What surprise have you stumbled upon during travel that gave you joy?

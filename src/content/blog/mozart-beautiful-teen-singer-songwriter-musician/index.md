As the beautiful young teenage girl named [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/kid-world-citizens-inspiring-speech-at-global-education-conference.html "Mozart teen speaker and singer"), began to sing, I swooned, fell totally in love and got goose bumps!  
  
**TALENTED TEEN SINGER WITH 4 OCTAVE RANGE**  
  
Okay, this [talented teen singer](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/tween-is-a-talented-singer-songwriter.html "talented teen Pop singer named Mozart") is my 13 year old daughter, an "only" and long-awaited child, so you know I am a shamelessly proud mama, but the audience seemed to have the same reaction and one of the tops in the business remarked on her outstanding charisma and 4 octave vocal style.  
  
The show had an 80's theme, (thus her curly, Pop-star big hair and look), that perhaps added to my partiality. Plus, this is my way of sharing a bit of the show, our process and news with family and friends.  
  
**WORLDSCHOOLING SUPPORTS PASSIONS**  
  
One of the advantages of [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool and travel") or [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "worldschooling best education unschool around the world"), and a [travel lifestyle,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "travel lifestyle") is a [child can follow their passions](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "TRAVELING KID TELLS WHY TO TRAVEL "). So one of the reasons for our [being in Dallas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/best-extended-stay-hotel-in-dallas-hawthorn-suites-addison-galleria.html "Hawthorn Suites - best extended stay hotel in Dallas") now is to allow [trilingual Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "trilingual Mozart travel kid expert") to follow her [passions in music](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/mozart-plays-mozart-and-more-violin-and-piano-performance.html "Passion in music for teen Mozart musician") and singing/songwriting.  
  
[![Mozart glowing with joy after she sang and performed - happy kid!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcd1ee3c970b.png "Mozart glowing with joy after she sang and performed - happy kid!")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcd1ee3c970b.png)  
  
This "[world's most traveled child"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "WORLD'S MOST TRAVELED CHILD"), is most at home on the stage and thrives on performance, be it [singing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "singing"), [playing music](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "travel teen Mozart playing music around the world -violin"), [public speaking](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "Mandarin ted talk speech by travel kid Mozart") or [acting](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/mozarts-film-de.html "travel kid Mozart film in Croatia japanese TV").  
  
**WAYS TO SUPPORT MUSIC TALENT**  
  
Last week ( besides her school work and teaching language jobs), she performed a Pop song onstage at a popular venue in Dallas, auditioned for a world-class conductor and Mandarin-speaking violinist for a Youth Orchestra, and started learning contemporary songwriting techniques from a classically trained expert. So we are very busy and in a music "bootcamp" exploring phase.  
  
**CHALLENGES FOR PARENTS SUPPORTING KIDS IN MUSIC**  
  
I must admit this is all exciting AND intimidating....even overwhelming and scary for her parents who are still trying to figure out how to support her talents AND protect her. It's like she has moved into a new realm now that she is a teen that makes me often feel over my head.  
  
I am really happy to have [College Goals](http://www.collegegoals.com/ "College Goals") on our team with their homeschool experts to help guide us through the maze of teen to college and career so will be writing more about that.  
  
**NEW ROADS ON LIFE AS AN ADVENTURE**  
  
She may be precocious, but she is young, so we have time.... yet her destiny seems to be calling. When I said, "[Watch out Shakira"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCvS6gBG-Y "watch out shakira") when she was barely six in Spain, I was joking. Now, I am not so sure ( and she loves Shakira's international bilingual example).  
  
Despite Mozart's considerable talents in [science](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/home-school-science-unschool-and-world-school-tips.html "homeschool science") and math, her heart seems to be in the arts and singing at the moment, so we will see where this takes us.

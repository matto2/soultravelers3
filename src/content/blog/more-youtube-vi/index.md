We thought we would share some exciting new videos that we are proud to finally have up on Youtube! We really enjoy the process of making them, ( which is primarily done by DaVinci so far, although I tend to find the music and we all decide on final take) but it is time consuming, especially on the move. We have tons of great video footage and keep taking more, so they will keep coming as we find time to fit them in.  

We will eventually get them all in their proper place on our website, but thought we would put a few of them up here on the blog to make them easy to access. You can go to [our channel on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3) if you want to see all ten of the new ones ( or all 22 total thus far) , but here are a few of our favorites.

We are having a hard time finding decent internet connection for uploading, so we will keep writing posts and uploading them in batches when we can. Don't forget to look in the archives in case we have uploaded more than what shows on the first few thumbnails if you see lots of new ones. You can also just click on our Twitter link as I try to put a current picture link or update as I can because it is often easier to get into Twitter to do something fast even if the internet cafe is expensive or not up to par. You do not have to join Twitter to see what we are up to and you can click on the links to see the pictures which will give you a small taste of what is to come!

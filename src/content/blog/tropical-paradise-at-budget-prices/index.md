Looking for a [Valentine's Day](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/happy-valentines-day-omg-its-illegal-in-malaysia.html "valentines day") or February Getaway? There is something about this time of year that makes me want to run away to a tropical paradise...especially when I lived on the East Coast or Midwest. The first snow was always exciting in November, but the cold, and dreariness got really old by February or March making me dream about an escape.  
  
We will soon be headed to [tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical asia penang"), but this photo was taken at a favorite spot of mine in the [Florida Keys](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "florida road trip") near Key West. This is [Bahia Honda](http://www.bahiahondapark.com/ "bahia honda"), one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It's a favorite spot with locals, but most tourists miss this gem.  
  
I once flew from New York City to this little heaven, abandoning the snow and rush of city life, for a cheap, glamping stay in my tent, right on this world class beach. They also have cabins available with kitchens if that is more your style.  
  
Dreaming of a beach holiday on a tiny budget?

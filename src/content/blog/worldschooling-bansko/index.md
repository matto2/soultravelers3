As a [worldschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html), [vanlife](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/01/americans-van-life-in-europe-2022.html), [digital nomad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) [pioneer family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html) who started [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html) in 2005 in 48 countries on a tiny budget, we are thrilled to see [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html) blossoming now! When I [swim for exercise](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/09/weight-loss-journey-update.html#more) here in [Bansko](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/08/-europes-cheapest-digital-nomad-haven-bansko.html#more), for my [weightloss journey,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/03/i-lost-100lbs-best-weight-loss-tips-.html)Â I have the pool all to myself in the cold water. What are the odds that I ended up swimming with boys from Holland, France and Bulgaria & they told me they are part of [Worldschool Bansko](https://www.facebook.com/groups/worldschoolingbansko/about/)! Luckily, I met the Dutch mom Â Emmy later & interviewed her about this [amazing worldschooling hub](https://arcticterns.global/worldschooling-bansko-2022/) she has created with her teen daughter. What an amazing opportunity for [worldschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html), [roadschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/learning-while-traveling-travel-homeschool-road-school-abroad-5-best-reasons.html) and [homeschooled kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html) from [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/05/travel-memories-from-around-the-world-roadschooling-.html)! I didn't even know there was such a thing as [worldschool Bansko](https://parentingpassportsandprofits.com/worldschooling-community-bansko-bulgaria/) until I happen to meet these boys!

Perhaps, even stranger & kismet, when I explained to the boys that we were [worldschool pioneers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html) & my daughter was [trilingual pop singer](http://soultravelers3new.local/2021/11/heavenly-reyna-releases-winter-wishes-trilingual-ep.html) [Heavenly Reyna](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com), the 12 year old Bulgarian boy was beside himself with excitement because he watches [her on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/heavenly) and is a big fan, so he was as shocked as I was that we connected by chance in this tiny Bulgarian town! There are more than 8 millionÂ [Twitch streamers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2021/07/heavenly-reyna-releasing-new-single-exit-july-21st.html), so against all odds!

You can read more about [Worldschool Bansko](https://arcticterns.global) [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1242977499373225) and [here](https://www.worldschoolingpopups.com/events/626429adb3014e01ffa17d5e). They started it in 2020 and just like the Bansko Â [Digital Nomad Festival](https://www.banskonomadfest.com), it keeps expanding every year ( and it is not related to the festival, but they both show the potential of Bansko). This worldschool "pop up" or "hub" takes place in the winter high season, so attracts families from around the world that love to ski! As more get involved, they may start it all year long.Â

No one was doing [worldschooling](https://purelypacha.com/a-directory-of-worldschool-hubs-for-nomad-families-and-life-long-learners/) Â [hubs](https://worldschoolinghub.com) or [popups](https://www.worldschoolingpopups.com/events) when we were [traveling as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html) ( there were so few of us then), so it is exciting to see these family travel communities come together like this. I have to give Emmy and her gifted 15 year old daughter Derisha much credit for their hard work on creating this community. Emmy and I had a lot in common as we discussed the challenges of [raising a gifted child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/curriculum-vitae-for-a-gifted-child-world-schooling.html) & how well travel assists that & [social issues for globetrotting location independent kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html) Â Her 8 year old son was also adorable and part of their team.Â

It has worked so well with Bansko, that they have expanded it and are doing a [Netherlands worldschool pop up](https://arcticterns.global/worldschooling-netherlands/) this November. Contact them soon if you are interested or pass it on to friends who might be.Â

They are also doing a cool, worldschooling teen program called [IQ Teen Camp](https://arcticterns.global/iq-teen-camp-netherlands/) in both Netherlands and Bansko.Â

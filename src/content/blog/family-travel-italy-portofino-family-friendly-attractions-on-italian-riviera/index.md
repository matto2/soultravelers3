[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is sometimes about dressing up in fancy clothes and leaning into the lifestyles of the rich and famous, even on our 23- dollar-a-day per person tight budget.  I want my child to see all of the world,  from [a Berber tent in the deep Sahara](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html) to [high tea in a posh hotel in London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330120a63c19fb970c). Today, [Portofino on the Italian Riviera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portofino), is not the rock star it once was, but it is still very beautiful and attracts some amazing yachts. Mozart put on her best sun dress (that [Grandma in California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/worlds-best-mot.html) had sent to her [in Spain](http://2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html) before we set out on our [European road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html)) as we left our [base in Cinque Terre](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/7-best-reasons-to-travel-cinque-terre-italy.html)  for a day of explorations.  
  
It had been over  twenty five  years since I last [visited Portofino](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photo-italy.html), but it hadn't changed that much and luckily it was not busy at all even though [we visited it in high season](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html) last year. It was fun just to wander around and do lots of people-watching, including those on the fanciest huge yachts. Perhaps the gelato served in crystal at the outdoor cafe made a bigger impression on our eight year old as they were not as big as the [gigantic trans-county overnight ferries](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/06/adriatic-birthd.html) that we have taken. You don't have to be rich to live a rich life!

The castle and wine area route on the Danube between Melk and Krems is a wonderful [family friendly area of Austria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/family-travel-photo-austria-melk-joy-in-water.html "family friendly austria") perfect for family travel. Many pay big bucks to do it by cruise ship, but we found out that doing it on your own can make it one of the cheapest and least crowded places in Europe even in high season.  
  
We were there in August and only paid 20 euros a night with our [campsite right on the Danube](http://www.campings-camping.com/campings/melk/melk-campings-a99.html "camping melk on danube") and basically had the whole campsite to oursleves which was like one huge park. Many Europeans like to do [this area by bike](http://www.mayq.com/Best_european_trips/Danube/Danube.htm "melk by bike") and it is easy and very enjoyable bike riding even for families with young children.  
  
The area is rich in history including the famousÂ  [Melk Abbey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/prettiest-church-in-the-world-melk-abbey-austria-european-golden-beauty-on-danube-in-wine-country-.html "Melk abbey") a UNESCO World Heritage Site where we did a [family Museum tour.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html "family museum tours") Instead of taking one of the expensive overnight cruise ships, save a bundle and take the same cruise as a day trip and bring your bikes with you. We had an idyllic August exploring this area, but alas I had a [freak accident](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "freak accident travel ") just before we were scheduled to leave so got to also explore their hospitals intimately which was not part of our plan.  
  
This photo is one of the many beautiful castles along the Danube that I took on one of our day cruises around sunset. Have you been to Melk or done any bike riding in Europe?

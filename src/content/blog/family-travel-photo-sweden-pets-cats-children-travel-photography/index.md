Pets can even be a part of family travel! Seven year old Mozart took this picture of our friend's cat last summer in [Sweden](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html) where we had a spectacular time staying in their cottage in the countryside. She just adored that cat and she sometimes misses our cat [Desiree](http://twitpic.com/pwym) that ran away [right before we left](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/more-chocolate.html) on our world tour.

It has been amazingÂ  how many kittens, [puppies](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/tunas-tradition.html), dogs and cats that she has found to play with, not to mention [baby goats](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/cheese-farm-fac.html),lambs, horses,[ducks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jYiqGE2VjQ&feature=channel_page) cows, birds and even camels! Quite a few [campgrounds](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/05/second-campgrou.html) even have small petting zoos as free amenity!  
  
She also really likes [using her camera](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/new-cameras.html) and it is enlightening to get a [glimpse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography) into her world view through them. She has had her own camera since 5, but she first took pictures when she was about 2 with those throw away cameras. What age do you think is the best age to start [a child interested](http://www.youthlearn.org/learning/activities/multimedia/photo1.asp) in [photography?](http://digital-photography-school.com/13-lessons-to-teach-your-child-about-digital-photography)

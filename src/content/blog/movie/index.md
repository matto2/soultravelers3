This is a clip from an award winning show on NBC, San Francisco, “Wine Country Living” that featured our home, vineyard and gardens as well as the process of creating it. We found the execution and completion of this dream to be an extraordinary transformative experience for us as well as the house as we turned it  into our idea of heaven on earth. We hope to put the same kind of passion, appreciation for beauty, fearlessness, determination and creativity into our open ended road trip around planet earth. Hoping once again to nourish and be nourished by all that we touch.

which I can not do,  
in order that  
  I may learn how to do it.”

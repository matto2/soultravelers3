This Mango Clafouti fits that bill whether you are [eating paleo](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/best-paleo-pizza-recipe.html "best paleo pizza") or vegetarian and it's a [popular treat](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/05/easy-healthy-homemade-ice-cream-no-machine-.html "homemade ice cream healthy and no machine") for our family that allows us to keep to our [curing cavities naturally](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "curing cavities naturally") [healthy diet](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/best-fresh-raw-goats-milk-penang.html "healthy diet").  
  
Clafouti or Clafoutis (pronounced klaw-foo-TEE) is a classic, rustic-style French country dessert from the Limousin region and traditionally uses cherries like this famous [Clafoutis recipe by Julia Child](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/JULIA-CHILDS-CLAFOUTIS-1270672 "recipe julia child clafoutis") , although people make them with many different fruits including pears, nectarines, peaches or raspberries.

We don't have it often, because we [aren't eating much fructose](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/03/13/richard-johnson-interview.aspx "dangers of fructose"), eat no sugar, no grains,  [avoid phytic acid](http://www.westonaprice.org/food-features/living-with-phytic-acid "avoid phytic acid") and even curtail our raw organic honey to minute amounts, but my best beloveds get a hankering for cobblers and this is close, somewhere between custard and cake. This dessert is almost guilt free!

I actually got the idea for this from [Mark Sisson’](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/ "mark Sisson")s Primal Cookbook as he had a recipe for Peach Clafouti in it, but since peaches and maple syrup are hard to find in [tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "how to find an apartment in tropical Asia penang"), I gave it my own little twist.  
  
Mangoes, coconut flour and [coconut milk](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconut milk") are SUPER cheap and available all year here at the markets, thus it's logical to use them here and it is extra scrumptious. I also didn't want to waste my [raw milk](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/04/raw-milk-fast-and-cure.html "raw milk fast") when [coconut is so cheap](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/awesome-asian-coconut-rickshaw-photo.html "coconut cheap asia").

This tends to go very quickly in our family so it's been hard to get photos!

Next I will have to give you my banana bread recipe which is probably the most popular one I do every week.

Have you ever had a clafouti before? We even love the new word! Who doesn't like mangoes, eh? Will you try this recipe or maybe substitute a compatible fruit bountiful in your area?

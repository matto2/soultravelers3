**These are the 15 Cheapest Beautiful Countries in Europe to Visit!**  
  
  

## **1\. Bulgaria**  
  
![15 Cheapest Beautiful Countries in Europe to Visit!  bansko bulgaria ski and hot spring resort ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

[Bulgaria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/bulgaria/) is one of the cheapest and most beautiful countries in Europe. We discovered Bulgaria because it is a [digital nomad](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/08/-europes-cheapest-digital-nomad-haven-bansko.html#more) haven & was out of Schengen zone. (This is no longer the case, as of 2024). We rented a large [one bedroom furnished apartment](https://www.fourleafclover-bansko.com) with balcony,  pool, sauna, fast internet, washer, great hiking, walkable to all needs, for 260 euros a month! There are lots of apartments like that available. [Bansko](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/08/bansko-ryanair-delay-traveling-keto-bread.html) is a lot cheaper even than our [rental apartments in Southeast Asia and Malaysia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html)! Bulgaria also has some of the best beaches in Europe as well as beautiful mountains and charming cities. The best places & bases in Bulgaria are Sophia, Varna, Burgas and Black Sea areas, [Bansko](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/09/worldschooling-bansko.html#more) and Plodiv. Bansko is cool, cheap and not crowded in off season and feels like budget Switzerland! The photo above was taken on our walk to the grocery store. We spent the last two summers in Bansko for July and August...best bargain in Europe summer! Plus only a 3 hour [drive to Greece](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwqAag3M5LU/). Bulgaria has some of the best food in Europe.

Bansko is located in the UNESCO world heritage Pirin mountain range and is famous for being fantastic for [winter skiing](https://thevanabondtales.com/skiing-bansko-bulgaria-cheapest-europe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=skiing-bansko-bulgaria-cheapest-europe) and for the seventh consecutive year topped the list for the [cheapest ski resort in Europe](https://ski-europe.com/resorts/bansko/) and North America! The town is walkable from end to end, there are plenty of great restaurants with food delivery widely available, good grocery stores, endless hiking, [mineral spas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/09/where-is-the-best-hot-springs-in-bansko-.html), mountain biking, horseback riding, river rafting, mountain climbing  are all popular activities. In 2016, a digital nomad called [Matthias Zeitler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mzeitler/?originalSubdomain=bg) ( from Germany) co-founded [Coworking Bansko](https://coworkingbansko.com/), which started the trend of making Bansko a [digital nomad haven](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/09/vacation-vs-full-time-travel-digital-nomad-lifestyle.html#more). He started the summer annual [Bansko Nomad Fest.](https://www.banskonomadfest.com/)This is a wonderful European country that most miss. Bulgaria offers all the charm of more popular European destinations at super low bargain prices! 

## **2\. Albania** 

  
  
![15 Cheapest Beautiful Countries in Europe to Visit!  albania soultravelers3 digital nomads travel albania riviera saranda ksmail corfu  ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
Albania is another gorgeous and super cheap country in Europe. With its awe-inspiring beaches and spectacular  mountain ranges  Albania is not only one of the cheapest European countries, but it’s also a magnificently beautiful one. We were stunned by the beauty of Albania's riviera last September and October, especially Ksamil. This photo shows Ksamil which is by far the most beautiful beach we have ever seen in Europe. And we have seen tons of [gorgeous beaches](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/yummy-beach-lun.html) in [Europe](https://www.instagram.com/p/CynxYmeMazo/). Surprisingly, it looked more like [Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/04/bora-bora-dream-vacation-on-a-low-budget.html), [Tahiti](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/the-ultimate-tahiti-vacation-on-a-backpacker-low-budget.html) or Bali with it's white sand, clear azure sea and mountains. Nearby [Saranda](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/11/meeting-a-rock-star-jazz-musician-traveling-.html) was our base and also beautiful with a wonderful walkable, long beach promenade. Saranda is only a half hour ferry ride from Corfu, Greece or a bit longer [to Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/greece-italy-cr.html). Corfu is a fantastic day trip, but, prices are so much cheaper to base in Albania. We booked a large apartment with sea views, 2 terraces, near the beach with 4 beds in Saranda for about 845 euros total for almost 2 months in the fall. I  will be writing more about this European well kept secret paradise that makes Thailand look expensive!

We also discovered Albania as a digital nomad Schengen shuffle country. We like it so much, that we are returning to Albania this summer! U.S. citizens may stay up to one year in Albania without applying for a residency permit. Best areas to visit in Albania are the capital and largest city of Albania, Tirana, the gorgeous Albanian alps like Theth, beach Ionian Sea areas like Ksamil and Saranda, Unesco Berat, Shkodër & Lake Shkoder, Vlore, Gjirokastër and near the iconic Lake Ohrid. It is truly shocking that an undiscovered beach paradise could be found in Europe today, much less that it would be so cheap! We have not tried exploring Albania by van yet, but I read and hear that one can free camp all along the gorgeous Albania riviera. If you like to avoid crowds, I would skip this beach area in high season July or August, but it is perfect in fall or spring. Even the winters are mild, but too cold for me.

[Montenegro](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/montenegro/) is a spectacularly stunning beautiful country, a cheap Europe destination and one of my favorite counties on this planet. When we first visited it in 2007, I wrote a blog post called ["Montenegro ....Who Knew?"](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/montenegrowho-k.html#more)    
It was so impressive then and still impressive on our [recent visit](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/10/top-instagram-photo-locations-in-kotor-montenegro.html) long [stay in fall](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/11/awesome-fall-colors-in-europe.html#more). I just booked an exquisite apartment in [Montenegro](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/10/road-trip-croatia-montenegro.html#more) for September and October on the beach in a new area. This cheap country  is so special that I have even looked at buying a home or apartment there. Hostels, hotels and apartments are cheap to rent in spring, fall and winter. We splurged on a luxurious, new,  very large home with killer sea views of Kotor riviera for about 400 dollars for ten days one recent October.

[Kotor Riviera](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0xAdt_MsZE/) is one of the [most beautiful places on earth](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3h0NdPMpze/). Cruise ships have ruined it a bit, in the old town, so be careful to avoid those crowds, especially in summer. The weather is still like summer in the early fall and late spring , but without the crowds or higher prices. Even the locals tend to take off in summer. But this is typical of most beautiful places in Europe since everyone and Europe takes their long summer vacations in July and August. This is when most tourism sites and beaches make their money. Some tourists do a one day road trip from Dubrovnik, Croatia to visit or a fast stop on a cruise. My advice is [explore Montenegro](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3h0NdPMpze/) deeper and stay as long as you can. My lead photo for this blog post is also in [Montenegro](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/kotor-riviera.html) and it is the private island of Sveti Stefan on the Budva Riviera. It is a famous resort visited by many celebrities, including Orson Welles, Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Kirk Douglas, Princess Margaret, Carlo Point, and more. So much beauty and available to all of us at bargain prices!

## **4\. Croatia**

We were blown away when we first visited Croatia by camper van in 2007. George Bernard Shaw said Dubrovnik was “paradise on earth” and after twenty five days budget camping there one August in 2007, we must concur, as we fell in love with this most beautiful and romantic “pearl of the Adriatic”.It becomes clear almost immediately why UNESCO has declared it a World Heritage Site. We did a slow travel [road trip all over Croatia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/10/road-trip-croatia-montenegro.html)

 You can find cheap budget lodging in Croatia. We found bargains in high season summer, but shoulder season bargains are easier. Croatia is the most popular beautiful budget European travel destination in the Balkans. We loved [luxury budget van camping Croatia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/heavenly-holida.html#more) in our vintage camping van on a budget in high season summer. We also loved staying at this [bargain budget airbnb in Dubrovnik](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/04/the-best-stunning-airbnb-in-dubrovnik-low-budget-.html#more) for just 33 dollars a night and just paid $23 dollars a night for an airbnb apartment in Split. They are saying Montenegro is the new Croatia and Albania is the new Montenegro. In my opinion, everyone should do deep dives in all 3 of these countries! They may not be as slick as some western European countries, but they make up for it with extraordinary beauty and low prices.   
  

## **5\. Cyprus**

[Cyprus](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/02/larnaca-travel-tips-.html) is another fairly recent discovery for us because of our Schengen Shuffle long stay [years of traveling Europe cheaply](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html).  It has some of the [warmest winters in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/12/top-8-warmest-winter-places-in-or-near-europe-for-digital-nomads-travel.html), so that interested me. [Cyprus](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn4hcEUMaY5/) is a very popular [holiday/vacation](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/08/secrets-for-a-permanent-vacation-travel-tips.html) destination, with 300 days of sunshine, but primarily in summer and [winter is "off season"](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoU57ukst_1/) although temps are usually in the seventies and it is a mostly [sunny beach](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoFYhmXsgXw/) location. So for cheapest costs, you  will do best by traveling there in the off season.There is no heating or insulation inside the homes in Cyprus, so be aware that nights can be cold in January and February inside, so make sure you have heat. Larnaca, Limassol, Paphos, Troodos Mountains and Nicosia are all great places to stay on a budget.

I loved being able to [walk every day on the beach](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/03/health-benefits-of-sun-barefoot-beach-walk.html#more) in [Larnaca](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/02/slavaukraini-ukraine-memorial-in-cyprus-.html#more). The European Environment Agency’s ranks Cyprus first among the European Union’s 27 nations for having the cleanest swimming waters. [Cyprus](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnkMjRYMSU7/) is Europe's sunniest island, set in the Mediterranean Sea near Turkey. The winters are similar to [Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html) and [California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/california-winter-beach-escape-.html), so mostly short, sweet and early spring & warmer temperatures arrive in March. All 3 are near [beaches](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2018/12/best-beach-in-los-angeles-el-matador-in-malibu-.html) yet also have [mountains for snow skiing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2016/07/driving-to-mammoth-from-los-angeles-plus-photo-essay.html) if one likes that. We stuck to the beaches in Cyprus, but great to know one can do both in the winter. We stayed in an airbnb large, furnished home with 2 bedrooms and huge terrace for 3 nights in January for 100 dollars total. We stayed in a beautiful, new one bedroom airbnb apartment in Larnaca that was a 5 minute walk to the beach, for $640 per month from January through April. Larnaca is a small town so all of it is very walkable.The early-10th-century Greek Orthodox cathedral of St. Lazarus is a lovely, magnificent stone church and incredible example of Byzantine architecture in Cyprus.  
  
  
  

## **6\. Poland**

There are lots of cheap European countries to visit, but Poland is a surprisingly delightful & affordable destination for travelers, digital nomads and expats. Krakow, Warsaw, Lodz, Katowice, Lublin, Gdansk, Tatra National Park are the top places to visit.  [Krakow](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/04/family-travel-krakow-poland-photo.html "Krakow travel tips") or Cracow in Poland is a UNESCO World Heritage site, fairy-tale ancient city and a popular, [cheap city break holiday](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-cool-krakow-bb-poland-best-budget-hotel.html "cheap city break holiday in Krakow - best hotel") destination for many Europeans. Sadly, most Americans miss this gem which is the prettiest city in Poland as it is the only one that escaped WWII bombings. All costs are very low to moderate and will vary depending on the city, with major cities having higher rental prices compared to smaller towns.

It's enchanting, fairytale-like, rich in history and with a thriving arts community. It's atmospheric Old Town and it's famous Jewish District, Kazimierz, as well as it's close proximity to Auschwitz, makes it well worth a visit. Krakow is a world-renowned college town, so crammed with creativity, flavor and life. Author Wihelm Feldman wrote at the turn of the century that to find the soul of Poland, you must seek it in [Krakow](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-photo-poland-krakow-dumpling-festival-pierogi-value-of-vacations-for-kids-world-peace.html "krakow") and that remains true today.

It also had excellent wifi in your room, and a very good breakfast included. Depending on your Poland location and time of visit hotels run about $25 - 45  a night and hostels less at $15- 25 a night.  
   
  

## **7\. Greece**   
  

![15 Cheapest Beautiful Countries in Europe to Visit!  greece corfu islands holiday paradise budget trip ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  
  
Like many of these beautiful, cheap European countries, [Greece](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/greece/) is in the Balkans. But unlike most,  it is also a Schengen country, so low budget more like Spain, Portugal and Italy. We love Greece and have done many long stay trips there in [Athens](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/acropolis-parth.html#more), [Rhodes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/rhode-city-old.html#more), [Santorini](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/heaven-on-earth.html#more), [Crete](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/chania-crete.html#more), Mykonos, Olympia, Mycenae, Peloponnese, [Delphi](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/delphi.html#more),Samos, Lindos, Palace of Knossos, Chania. This past summer and fall we visited  [Meteora](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwsqu9UsnOb/), Thessaloniki and Corfu. We [pioneered world schooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/curriculum-vitae-for-a-gifted-child-world-schooling.html) our child for a decade and she loved Greek history and Mythology, thus our extended stays in Greece. We saved a lot of money traveling Greece cheaply as a family by using our vintage van. Or a combination as sometimes we left the van like in Santorini and used ferries and other housing.

We spent over a month on beautiful Santorini in Greece and had it all to ourselves in June. It's unique and breathtaking geological position on a volcano plus 4000 year old history along with it's stunning beauty makes it a "must see" on everyone's list. We loved [Santorini camping](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/santorini-campi.html) which has everything you need including bungalows for those without a tent or RV, plus a great pool, good internet pool side, fab restaurant and lovely people! June or September are great months for Santorini but do NOT go in July and August.

This past Sept we drove ( with a driver) 3 hours from Bansko, Bulgaria to Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki and then paid 92 dollars total for 4 days in a quiet airbnb there ( Sept 1-4). We also visited Meteora as a day trip and then flew to Corfu and ferried then onto the Albanian riviera. Our itinerary was a perfect example on how to cut costs but enjoy luxury travel.   
  

## **8\. Czech Republic   
  
  
![15 Cheapest Beautiful Countries in Europe to Visit!  prague at night soultravelers3 budget travel czech republic ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)** 

  
  
The Czech Republic is one of the cheaper countries in Western Europe and it is beautiful. It has a large, thriving digital nomad and expat community. Low costs and beauty attracts. Prague is spectacular and even prettier than everyone says. Most agree that it ranks high in the ranking of the most beautiful cities in Europe. No crowds in October, so always know that when you go is key,  as that affects prices. Prague of course will be more expensive than other places in this country, but it is still much cheaper than London or Paris etc. Prague, [Český Krumlov](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/10/czech-ing-cesky.html), Brno, Pilsen,  & Moravian Karst are the most popular spots. When we first traveled to Prague in 2007, we saved a lot of money [by camping](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g274684-c3-zff29-Czech_Republic-Hotels.html) in our vintage van.   
  
The campgrounds in Prague are different than we have seen anywhere else. We picked one amongst many in a northern suburb just ten kilometers from the center of Prague on an easy bus and tram route. What was strange is they were in peoples backyards of quite nice suburban homes. They have parking space for about five or six small RV’s an even a couple really tiny “zimmers” or rooms to let for those without a tent or RV. It was all very neat and well cared for and the showers, bathrooms and dishwashing sinks (known as sanitary facilities in European camper-speak) looked new. We stayed at one on a street filled with house after house with camping in the backyard and the family was very nice and helpful. They even did laundry for you for a low cost so we took advantage of that. It was late in the season, so there were only two or three RV's during our stay. I have forgotten the name, but it is the one next to autocamp Trojska ([www.autocamp-trojska.cz](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/10/www.autocamp-trojska.cz)) which is the one we had planned to go to, but it was closed for some reason. Another advantage for kids is it is only two bus stops away from the Prague Zoo.

Don't miss this amazing Mozart puppet show for all ages.! It is a "must see" if you go to Prague.   
  
Also, don't miss the  lovely, cheaper, authentic Cesky Krumluv, one of the prettiest towns in the Czech Republic (and another Unesco World Heritage Site), It is very close to the Austrian border and we especially loved it and Prague. Today hotels run about $30-50 per night and hostels for less of course. You will save money also if you stay longer and get the monthly rates on airbnb apartments.   
  

## **9\. Portugal**

Portugal is a diverse, beautiful and popular country that can also be very cheap if you know when and where to go. We first [traveled all over Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/portugal/) in 2008 and fell in love with it. We also just did a winter road trip by car from Barcelona to the Algarve, Sintra and Lisbon, very cheaply. We've been to Lisbon, Algarve, Sintra, Obidos, Porto, Vianado Castela, Douro Valley, Vigo, Nazare, Alcobaca. Cabo de Roca, Evora, Cabo De Sao Vicente, Salema,Olhao, Portimao, Lagos and more. We did them all cheaply. The prices of course will vary depending on when you go and where you go.

You can save a lot on lodging this way, although trains are also very cheap in Portugal.

We spent 221 dollars for a cute budget lodging in the Algarve near beaches & Portimao recently for 12 days dec 26 through Jan 6th. We stayed in a beautiful sailboat in Lisbon for 35 dollars for a night. We've paid 8 euros  a night for a great place with our [camper van](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/arriving-in-alg.html). A rental bungalow there costs about 18 dollars a night in winter now, but they book up fast.  We've [been to Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2024/01/winter-sun-camping-europe-snowbirds.html#more)a [few times](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/portuguese-day.html), so know the best secrets.

Another cheap European country gem is [Slovenia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/slovenia/)!  Like most Americans, we knew little about [Ljubljana](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/10/lovely-ljublija.html#more) or Slovenia, other than it was part of the former Yugoslavia like Croatia and Montenegro. It gained its independence in 1991 and is very popular with European tourists. Slovenia is richer than most central European nations and uses the euro. It is called the greenest country in Europe with lovely countryside and the Julian Alps (named after Julius Caesar). Ljubljana is a pretty small city and the largest in Slovenia. Some call it a mini Prague and it has lovely pedestrian bridges, willow-lined streets, imperial Austrian and Slavic architecture. We stayed cheaply with bargain fall rates  at Camping Jezica in a northern suburb because it has easy access by bus to the Old Town. Both Ljubljana and Lake Bled are must sees and Piran, Koper and Maribor are bargains too. Camping is cheapest and hotels run about 40- 60 dollars a night and hostels much cheaper.

[Lake Bled](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/10/beautiful-lake.html#more) is in Slovenia near the Austrian border, just 45 km northwest of Ljubljana, so it is an easy drive. Lake Bled  has special charms including its magical island with a church in the center and castle looking down from a nearby hill. It is a popular tourist spot in summer, but was not busy in late September, despite the good weather and beautiful harvest colors, much to our delight. Picturesque and peaceful,Lake Bled is a delight in the fall with bargain prices. Don't miss it!

 [Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html) is one of our favorite [places in Europe.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/12/rv-in-europe-road-trip-europe-camping-european-style.html) We have been visiting this [Barcelona  luxury camping resort](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html) since 2006. I wrote about how to winter in Spain in our popular classic post "[How to do Extended Travel & Mini-retirements"](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) that is filled with links. I think Andalusia in the small villages, is the perfect combination of exotic and modern with wonderfully accepting people and fascinating culture with a rich history. We also have spent many years visiting Barcelona area on a budget. We store our vintage van there when we travel other methods.   
We have become accidental [trail blazers in extended family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) with tons of varied experiences in digital nomad  living (and [roadschooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/hanging-out-roa.html)) on our open ended world tour since 2006, so grateful we could help others, since 70% of families dream about extended travel.  
  
At our luxurious Barcelona beach resort, we pay 17€ a night in our vintage van and  43€ a night, 294€ for a week, 756€ for a month to stay in a 3 bedroom bungalow. ( Not in July and August when prices sky rocket). We cook our own food mostly & buy in local farmers markets and stores like Spaniards On our recent winter road trip we stayed in budget bungalows, hostal  and hotels for under 38€ a night but would pay much less for a long stay.   
  
**12\. Turkey**

![15 Cheapest Beautiful Countries in Europe to Visit!  turkey cappadocia istanbul budget beauty hospitality ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/7ef6f71052fbaca5084daa8842dcc264.jpg)  
  
  
[Turkey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/turkey/index.html) straddles Europe and Asia and is another beautiful cheap European destination for budget travelers and digital nomads. Istanbul is a very beautiful city somewhat similar to San Francisco or Barcelona at first glance since it is a sunshiny busy port. It is a huge, sprawling city of fourteen million people. Home to three [mighty empires in the past](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/best-places-to-visit-ancient-roman-and-greek-ruins.html#more), I was surprised to find it to be such a familiar and inviting modern European city. Some how the name Istanbul conjures up exotic imagery, and that is there if one hunts it down, but it was more like Rome or Paris than the Moroccan cities we visited.Turkey offers so much on a low budget, from Mediterranean coastal towns to rural areas to city living. We have visited most of Turkey and highly recommend [Istanbul](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/topaki-palace-b.html#more), Fethiye and the [Turquoise Coas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/turkeys-turquoi.html)t, [Cappadocia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/cappadocia-cave.html#more), Antalya, Ankara, Bodrum, Izmir, [Pamukkale](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/pamukkale-and-h.html#more) and more.

Fethiye is considered the crown jewel of the Turquoise Coast and the cliff-side, rock cut Lycian tombs and grand sarcophagi are awe inspiring.  Fethiye on Turkey’s Riviera is a European-like atmosphere popular with digital nomads. We found it to be more like Spain, France or Greece, yet it has its own special flavor and beauty. Again, also in Turkey,  you will find your cheapest prices in smaller cities, off peak season summer,  camping or long stay apartments or hostels. Food costs are low.  In Istanbul the cost of a one bedroom apartment with utilities is $225 per month. Hotels run from $10 per person in a 2 star hotel in Turkey to  $40-$45 for 4 star high end hotels. Hostels are cheaper of course. Turkey has the best hospitality we have ever encountered.   
  

## **13\. Hungary**

Hungary is another amazing one of our cheapest countries in Europe to travel to! Budapest is the capital of Hungary and many call it the "Paris of the East". [Budapest](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/family-travel-budapest-hungary-family-friendly-fun-and-educational.html "Budapest travel"), the "city of baths", is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. We were charmed by this world class city at first glance in 2010. The beautiful Danube River  divides Buda and Pest. [Family  travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is about exploring exotic places together.  For us, [Budapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest)t seemed like an exotic place, but we found it to be a [world class city](http://www.budapestinfo.hu/en/general_information) and very charming. The drive from Vienna was pleasant and on excellent roads. We went by van & saved money that way. This is a photo of the [Hungarian Parliament Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Parliament_Building),  one of the most famous buildings in Budapest. It is the 3rd largest Parliament building in the world. Budapest is a popular, bargain city for tourists and digital nomads.

We so loved the friends that we met in [Denve](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/03/castle-marne-trip-advisors-1-bb-in-denver.html)r and his parents were from Hungary so that experience, discussion about their travels in Hungary and sharing a traditional Hungarian meal with them added to our excitement. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment will vary between 400 and 700 dollars per month. Campsites are cheap and convenient if you do van life or rent a car. Budapest is most popular but also visit Eger, Pecs and Sopron. Late fall is often very cold and rainy so be aware of that.   
  

## **14\. North Macedonia   
  
![15 Cheapest Beautiful Countries in Europe to Visit! ohrid lake beauty budget fish ancient ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)** 

Don't miss North Macedonia as it is one of Europes cheapest countries and a beautiful hidden marvel! North Macedonia is famous for it's  Unesco Lake Ohrid area, budget prices, mountains and idyllic villages. Lake Ohrid is on the North Macedonia–Albania border in the Balkans and southeastern Europe. We will be writing more about it soon as we are renting an apartment on this famous lake this summer. It is a wonderful spot for sightseeing, nature and relaxing and not too hot. We have rented a lovely, large, new apartment steps from the Lake and near a National park for 640 dollars a month ( on the Albanian side). Hotels run about  25 to 40 dollars a night and hostels much cheaper.

  Lake Ohrid is one of the oldest and deepest fresh water lakes in Europe. The hoards of tourists have not discovered this area yet, but they will. I already hear a lot of raves from digital nomads and full time travelers.  The best places to visit in this area are Lake Ohrid & Ohrid, the capital Skopje, Pelister National Park, Bitola & Tikves Lake.

Are you surprised to see [Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/italy/) in  our list of cheapest beautiful  countries in Europe? If you skip the tourism hot spots in Italy, Portugal and Spain, you can see them on a low budget! Travel to Italy does not have to  be expensive if you are smart. We’ve [visited Rome](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-rome.html) & [Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/italy-with-kids-travel-tips.html) many times ( I lived in [Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/family-travel-italy-verona-opera-carmen-aida-domingo-zeffirelli-family-friendly-educational-travel.html) in my early twenties when [I modeled with Ford Models)](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/how-my-almost-teen-became-a-model-.html), so know the budget tricks. Big cities tend to be intense with crowds, tourists & traffic, so we tend to like to stay in more relaxed areas (cheaper too) & go into the city ( like Rome) for the day as day trips and most of Europe makes that easy with great mass transit. We have loved visiting  Milano, [Florence](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/the-uffitzi.html#more), [Venice](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/venetian-violin.html#more), [Verona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/romeo-juliet-in.html#more), the Italian Riviera like Portofino, [Cinque Terra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/7-best-reasons-to-travel-cinque-terre-italy.html), Capri, Pompeii, Umbria, [Tuscany,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html) Pisa, Bari, and more on a low budget! There are tons of cheap places to visit in Italy. When, where and how you travel counts a lot. We've done both camping van travel in Europe very cheaply as a family as well as using airbnb apartments. Hostels are another cheap lodging option.

Love these beautiful tropical greens! Are you wearing your green for St. Patrick's Day? As I lazed about in my jacuzzi [in tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "tropical asia penang") today, I thought that this doesn't feel a bit like St. Paddy's day. No one here seems to be celebrating, although there is an Irish bar a few blocks away and they probably have something going on.  
  
I didn't wear green, but I drank a green smoothie for breakfast and admired all the lush greenery around me. If you are in an Irish frame of mine, here's a few Emerald Isle posts to please you:

Meanwhile, I will go back to the pool and more lazing about as the tropics seem to do that to me. Happy St. Patrick's Day and top of the morning to you!

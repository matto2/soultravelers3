Family travel is about learning  
to appreciate different cultures,  
even when it is in your own country!

[Family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is about learning to appreciate different cultures, even when it is in your own country! Thanks to the amazing people at Hawaiian Tourist Board ( HVCB) and Kauai Visitors Bureau , we are in gorgeous [Kauai, Hawaii](http://www.kauaidiscovery.com/) right now, having an absolutely blissful experience. I will be telling you much more about it, but we are [traveling fast now](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/want-to-meet-us-in-london-sf-or-singapore-soultravelers3-travel-meetups-.html#more), so I will just have to do short photo posts until we slow down.

I will tell you that after sailing along the spectacular 3000 foot cliffs of theÂ  [Napali Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81_Pali_Coast_State_Park), seeing 5 or 6 blissful pods of dolphins, turtles and snorkeling with [Blue Dolphin Charters](http://www.kauaiboats.com/) for breakfast and lunch the first day, we headed to a [Luau at Kilohana Plantation](http://www.kilohanakauai.com/) for dinner and we were wowed by many things including a wonderful theatrical dance show that taught us much about [Hawaiian history and culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Hawaii). As you can see by our faces, we have definitely caught the aloha spirit....more details coming soon! Hawaii is the top dream destination for Mozart who has been begging to visit Hawaii since she was five, so super thrilling for all of us to finally get here.

Have you been to Hawaii? What were your favorite moments?

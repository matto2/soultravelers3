Peeking into new world's of wonder is what family travel is about! Here seven year old Mozart explores a hidden forest behind a rock wall door in Blarney, [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) last summer. She had just kissed the [Blarney stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blarney_Castle), we did one of her [violin vignettes](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3) in front of the castle and we were off wandering around the beautiful park-like grounds.  

We spent quite a bit of time in Blarney and met some great people there because [our RV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/questions-answers-about-soultravelers3-family-travel.html#more) was rear-ended in France on our way to catch the [ferry to Ireland](http://www.brittanyferries.ie/). Luckily, we found someone there to fix it well enough to last until we returned to [Spain for the winter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/grace-gratitude.html#more), thus we had lots of fun getting to know this area. We also happened to run into the teacher we liked best from our [gulet trip in Turkey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/sailing-away.html#more), the summer before. He just happened to walk past us on an empty street. Small world!

I will be posting much more about our big tour all around Ireland last summer. After two and a half years of traveling the world in non-English speaking countries, it was quite a profound and surprising culture shock to finally be in our first country where English was the dominant language!

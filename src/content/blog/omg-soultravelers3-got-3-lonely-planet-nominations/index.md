We are jumping for joy here in Spain! Yep, that's  Mozart at our local playground in our 15th century village. Thanks to our friend [Peace Mitchell](http://twitter.com/peace_) in [Australia,](http://www.cairnsfamilyholidays.com.au/more_info/about_us.htm "blog") we found out this morning that we have been nominated for three, yes THREE different [Lonely Planet travel blogging awards](http://lplabs.com/2009/02/25/voting-open-for-the-2009-travel-blogger-awards/)!

I am hacking away with my first cold of the year, feeling like I am in a fog and this wonderful news woke me right up! What a difference a day makes, eh? I am stunned. I think we are the only ones who got three nominations, although a couple of our friends got two nominations. When I first looked, I thought we did not get any, as we are far down on the page.

I have been discouraged by these voting contests in the blogosphere because it often seems based on how many votes you can get from friends. Recently we were one of the top travel nominees in the [Shortyawards](http://www.knightfoundation.org/news/press_room/knight_press_releases/detail.dot?id=339653) , but I did not even blog about it. I was very disappointed in the cheating and buying votes that was reported on the wildly popular [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/20/people-paying-good-money-to-cheat-pointless-twitter-competition) and [Pistachio](http://pistachioconsulting.com/shortyawards-gaming/) .Nevertheless, [the press](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/the-scene-at-the-twitter-awards-chatter/ "NYTimes") had a [hey  day](http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/02/12/twitter.shorty.awards/index.html "CNN on shorty awards") with it , including our [local home  paper](http://www.mercurynews.com/centralcoast/ci_11736671?nclick_check=1) the Mercury News!

I didn't even tell family or friends about this [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/) contest, even though I have great respect for Lonely Planet guides and we would really like to win it. I am busy just trying to catch up here in Spain , so I never dreamed we would be nominated for one, let alone three categories.

I was shocked when I read Lonely Planet's [Mathew Cashmore](http://twitter.com/lplabs) say on Twitter that " I haven't counted the number of blogs entered yet but it's well over 500. The top nominated blogs all got over 100 nominations". All I can say is, thank you, thank you, thank you to the people who nominated us.  
  
I am honored to be  amongst some amazing blogs like [National Geographics Intelligent Trave](http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/intelligenttravel/)l, [Elliottdotorg](http://www.elliott.org/) and [TravelRants](http://www.travel-rants.com/) plus many other friends, too numerous to mention.  
  
The nominations were done strictly by votes, but Mathew Cashmore also said " nominations however was based totally on public nominations - no judges - I think we may change that next year it was a mistake I believe."

I think I have to agree with him and my friend [Nomadic Matt](http://twitter.com/nomadicmatt) who said on Twitter "i havent heard of half of the travel blogs nominated for the LP awards". It is true, I have not heard of half of them either and this is typical of award contests in the blogosphere, because this voting thing can be gamed and fixed. Even if someone has a bad blog  they can win if it is based on votes.

Some great ones get through, but there were also some great ones missed. Perhaps that is just the way of life. I am not sure if there is any way to do a contest and make it really fair. I think a lot of bloggers feel frustrated by these things.

That is why I was completely shocked. I had written these off as I just did not want to play the game of asking for nominations  only to be disappointed again in a rigged contest. There were many really wonderful travel blogs that were left completely out. It is always the case. That makes me sad and I hope they do change the rules next year because Lonely Planet is a prestigious name that any travel blogger would like to be associated with.

The good news is that the voting now only counts for 50% and judges count for 50%, so I am hoping against hope that we get a fair shot. By some how miraculously getting 3 nominations, maybe we will actually get to win this one! I feel as excited as if I just got three oscar nominations.

Actually 3 different things we do are nominated.

\* First is for Best Microblogging that I do on Twitter ( we now have over 5000 really cool followers there).

\* The second is for Best Video which DaVinci mainly does and our "little movies" have proven to be very popular with over 1.2 million views so far on our [Soultravelers3 Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3)

\*Third is Best Themed which is this blog on family world travel

We work hard to bring the joys of our travels to you and give you the information we are learning along the way, so it is really rewarding to be acknowledged. I am thrilled to be nominated, tickeled pink that we some how got three nominations, so would really love your votes!

It is an easy one to do and you can see the results as they go which makes it exciting ( or maddening).

 [VOTE HERE!](http://lplabs.com/2009/02/25/voting-open-for-the-2009-travel-blogger-awards/ "Lonely Planet voting")

Luckily, the three we are in are all together. You just click on Soultravelers3, which fills the little circle next to our name, then just below the nominees in each category you will see a vote button. You click on that. Do it once for each of our categories and you are done!

Look at the other categories too as there are  probably many other blogs that you would like to vote for. Thank you so much for nominating us and thank you so much for voting for us! I am overwhelmed with gratitude!  I have heard so many congrats from people on Twitter and Facebook and appreciate them all.

 I also came across this [wonderful post](http://www.myseveralworlds.com/2009/02/24/soultravelers3-traveling-with-soul/) by Carrie Marshall, a Canadian who has a great blog called My Several Worlds about her travels over the last six years. How sweet!

Tell all your friends, because this is going to be a tight one. It closes at midnight on March 20 which is fitting as that is just a few days after my birthday! Hopefully, it will be a fun birthday surprise for the absolutely oldest person in the whole contest! Grin!  At least we will always have bragging rights on three nominations! Life is beautiful!

The poverty in Asia  
can be shocking despite  
this being the Asian century

The poverty in Asia can be shocking despite this being the Asian century and the fact that we are staying in one of the most prosperous countries in [South East Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "south East Asia"). It's partly the contrast in [Malaysia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "Malaysia travel") that stuns.  As you might recall, we are [renting a luxury condo in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "renting a luxury condo in Penang") and this is one of the buildings across the street from us. All the construction near us has these shanty towns filled with the workers and their families.  
  
There seems to be plenty of work here and the contruction business is booming, in stark contrast to  what we have witnessed in [Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Europe vacation") and [California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California") lately. But it is shocking that this is how the workers, who are out all day, 7 days a week in this hot sun, live. I am not sure if they are locals or foreigners, but there is no running water and the most primitive conditions.  
  
Not everyone lives like this of course, many local families live in our luxury building and there are plenty of brand new _Mercedes_\-_Benz_ and [high-end cars](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/yellow-lamborghini.html "high end luxury cars") that go by as we wait for the bus with poorer locals or [doing businesses on bikes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/awesome-asian-coconut-rickshaw-photo.html "Asia business on bike"). There are many luxury buildings in this area, but also modest row houses and some other primitive row houses that are poor, but a big step up from this.  
  
[Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Asia travel Georgetown") is definitely a land of contrasts. When you feel unhappy with your life and problems, just look at these families and know how truly blessed you are.  
  
"As long as there is poverty in the world I can never be rich, even if I have a billion dollars. As long as diseases are rampant and millions of people in this world cannot expect to live more than twenty-eight or thirty years, I can never be totally healthy even if I just got a good check up at Mayo Clinic. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This is the way our world is made. No individual or nation can stand out boasting of being independent. We are interdependent." Martin Luther King Jr.

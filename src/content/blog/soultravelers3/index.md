### WHO

We are a family of three from Santa Cruz, California. Mom and Dad are in our early 50's and our "nina" is 5 years old.   [MORE DETAILS>>](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/genisis.html)

### WHAT

An epic odyssey: open-ended, years long slow trip around the world as a family adventure, unschool, spiritual journey and lifestyle.

### WHERE

The first two and half years in Europe with southern Spain as the winter base following the good weather and our inner whims including trips into Russia,Africa and Egypt. Later bases will probably be Buenos Aires for South America and Thailand for the Far East, Australia and New Zealand.  [MORE DETAILS>>](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/genisis.html)

### WHEN

September 2nd 2006 is the take off date when we take a non stop flight from San Francisco to Amsterdam which starts our European leg of our world tour.

### WHY

To see the world and know it more deeply, connect deeper with ourselves as individuals, as a family and with others and experience freedom, bliss and peace in new and profound ways with time to bask in it and breathe it all in and serve the Lord with every step.

“Earth's crammed with heaven.”

Our goal  for our marriage that  was in our wedding vows and lives in our hearts was to “co-create heaven on earth  together” and this seems to be our next step in this process for us.  [MORE DETAILS>>](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/genisis.html)

### HOW

We will do much of the European leg via small motorhome and have purchased one already and will purchase a larger one after we finish living in a rental home that we have secured in Andalucia, Spain for this coming winter. We thought we would start with a smaller one at first since we had the rental. So we will be using a combination of things as we travel and like the idea of using a “homebase” for each continent to give us a home away from home. We picked Spain for Europe because 2 out of the 3 of us are bilingual in Spanish and its the home of their ancestors. We have satellite for 24/7 connection (starting Nov.1st), webcam, Skype and quad band phone to stay connected with family and friends as we roam. We recently sold a beloved home and most of our belongings to retire early, lighten up and take this journey so will be traveling on a budget and making much of it up as we go. We will be putting many of the answers on this website and blog as we have time.  [MORE DETAILS>>](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/genisis.html)

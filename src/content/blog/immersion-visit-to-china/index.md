If you want to be [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent in Mandarin how-to"), an [immersion visit to China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "immersion visit to China") is very important.  
  
**LEARNING MANDARIN IN CHINA**  
  
[Learning Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "learning Mandarin in Beijing") at the [best school in Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/learning-mandarin-in-beijing-china-best-school.html "learning mandarin in Beijing best school") was a great help to Mozart, even though she was already fluent from her [Chinese school in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "chinese school in Asia").

**BEST SCHOOL AND HOMESTAY IN BEIJING**  
  
Doing a [Beijing homestay](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/best-homestay-living-with-a-family-in-china.html "best beijing homestay") combined with her boarding at the school during the week, added a lot of exposure to the language. [Living with locals](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/homestay-china-living-with-locals-whats-it-like-.html "homestay China - living with locals") makes a huge difference in learning the language, understanding the culture and making friends for life.

**RAISING MULTILINGUAL GLOBAL KIDS**  
  
We've written before about the importance of immersion in our [Raising a Multilingual Child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "raising a multilingual child") series and [How and Why to Raise a Global Kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "why raise a global kid").[

**ANCIENT CHINESE CULTURE**  
  
Exploring the many [World Heritage Sites in China](http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/CN/ "world heritage sites") in cities like [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "best of Beijing travel"), [Shanghai](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/shanghai-with-kids.html "Shanghai with kids") and [Xi'an](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/making-friends-in-china-.html "Visiting Xian and making friends in China") with ancient places like the [Terra Cotta Warriors](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/terracotta-army.html "terra cotta warriors") makes a life long impact on one studying Chinese.  
  
![Chinese festival - Immersion visit to China to learn Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcd3ceaa970b.png)  
  
**CHINESE FESTIVALS AND TCM**  
  
Don't miss any of the festivals and Chinese celebrations if you get a chance, like this one that we saw which was fascinating and filmed live on Chinese TV all over China as we watched.  
  
Also experiencing [Traditional Chinese Medicine travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/traditional-chinese-medicine-travel-in-china.html "traditional chinese medicine travel") while in China is like no where else in the world.  
  
![Great Wall - Immersion visit to China to learn Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcd3ceca970b.png)  
  
Or a trip to see [the Great Wall](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/the-great-wall-of-china.html "the great wall of china"). We were lucky to experience it without the crowds.  
  
![Trilingual Mozart Walking city wall in Xi'an - Immersion visit to China to learn Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcd3cf03970b.png)  
  
**LEARN MANDARIN AT HOME AND ABROAD**  
  
[Learning Mandarin at home and abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/mandarin-chinese-learning-at-home-and-abroad.html "learning mandarin at home and abroad") is a great combo. !3 year old Mozart continues her daily practice on Chinese as we roam the world whether we are in [Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "Petra family travel"), [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "spain travel tips"), [Southeast Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/stunning-kek-lok-si-largest-buddhist-temple-in-se-asia.html "southeast Asia"), the [USA](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-nyc-usa-metropolitan-museum-of-art-egyptian.html "USA travel NYC Met") or where ever. Skype helps her talk to friends in Chinese living in China.  
  
**MANDARIN AND TRAV EL**  
  
We are happy that we have found a friendly Mandarin-speaking Chinese expat community here in Dallas for our [short stay base](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/best-extended-stay-hotel-in-dallas-hawthorn-suites-addison-galleria.html "Dallas short stay base"), but the time in [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/family-travel-beijing-tiananmen-square.html "family travel beijing") and China immersion was invaluable.Â   
  
**MORE TRAVEL AND IMMERSION**  
  
We are exploring North America now and then onto [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best europe family vacations") and likely South America and South Africa, but we will return to China for more immersion in the future, exploring and connecting with friends.  
  
Have you done an immersion visit to China or plan one?

Having [spent the last 8 years](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "traveling 8 years"), (all of her primary school years) [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "traveling the world") ( 45 countries on 5 continents so far) and becoming [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent in Mandarin") and [Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/best-classes-or-tutor-for-spanish-english-or-mandarin-in-penang.html "best tutor for Spanish"), she has much to offer about the experiential value of becoming a [global citizen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "global citizen") early in life.

**MOZART'S FIRST WORLD WIDE SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT**  
  
This is her first world wide speaking engagement so she is excited and a little nervous, so I hope you can join us. It is free and open to everyone with time for Questions and Answers at the end.Just-turned 13 year old Mozart has a passion about wanting to make a difference, so this conference aligns with our goals. The video above is the easiest way to watch her inspiring speech now.

**GLOBAL EDUCATION CONFERENCE GOALS**

If you go to the [main page](http://www.globaleducationconference.com/ "gec main page"),  click on ATTENDING + [SCHEDULE link](http://www.globaleducationconference.com/page/2013-sessions-and-schedule "schedule") in the left side panel and then go all the way to the bottom and click on YOUR time zone under the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) section, you will be able to find the correct time in your time zone. Once you find your time zone, then it will take you to the [presentation page](http://www.globaleducationconference.com/page/globaledcon-schedule-gmt-5 "presentation page") where you can use the little scroll arrows ( that say "next period" when you touch them and move forward in time) to find Mozart's presentation called,"13 year old Trilingual Pioneer in Global Education - World as Classroom- LITERALLY".

It will also be archived, so if you can't make it "live" you can catch it later, but Mozart hopes she has a good and interested audience.  
  
This is the [direct link to her presentation](https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/launch/dropin.jnlp?sid=2008350&password=GECPart223 "direct link to GEC presentation"), but if you haven't used this blackboard collaborative system or are on a Mac,iPhone, iPad, or Android device you might be better off going to the main page or Schedule link above to make it easier as it is a little complex, so leave yourself time to familiarize with the system.

If you have any problems, there are volunteers and moderators on the site in the main room chat that can help you.  
  
Looking forward to this exciting adventure and meeting you in this new medium for us. Looks like there are some amazing presentations this week with a huge global audience doing good things.

 [Heidelberg, Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg "Heidelberg, germany") is a picturesque  small city about an hour from Frankfurt with a University and located along the Neckar River. Heidelberg is part of the German "Castle Road" and I so loved it long ago that I wanted to share it with my family and see it again.  
  
With it's romantic, evocative castle ruins and colorful streets, it's perfect for family travel or anyone who enjoys history and pretty smaller towns. I still have so much to write about our time in Germany but here are a few posts that you might like on this topic:

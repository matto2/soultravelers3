"Noble fathers have noble children." - Euripides  
  
As someone who just lost my father last month, and recently loss my [step-fathe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "losing a father")r and my [father-in-law](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/good-bye-dad-grandpa-family-death-afar-while-traveling-abroad.html "loss of father and grandpa"), this is a poignant Father's Day for our family. Love and appreciate your dear ones while you have them and know they stay with you always even after they pass as they live in your hearts.  
  
I am so very grateful that my sweet husband has so much time with my lovely daughter and watching their relationship nutures me. It is one of the main reasons we took this big gamble of [retiring early](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "EARLY RETIREMENT") to [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "TRAVEL THE WORLD") and have more time together. She has had more time with her father ( and mother) than most kids ever get and I will be forever grateful for that.  
  
"A child looks up at the stars and wonders. Great fathers put a child on his shoulders and helps them to grab a star."  
  
Wishing you many happy memories on this Father's Day! It is not Father's Day here in Asia, but we are celebrating it here anyway. What are you doing to celebrate? What is your favorite memory or lesson from your father?

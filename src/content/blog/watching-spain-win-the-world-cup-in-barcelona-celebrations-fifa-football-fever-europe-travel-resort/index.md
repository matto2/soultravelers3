Where was the very best place to be last night to [watch Spain's historic win of the World Cup](http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/how-theyre-celebrating-in-spain/)? [Barcelona!](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2010/article-1293966/Catalans-crazy-Barcelona-beat-Dutch-World-Cup-final.html) One of our fantastic things about [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html?cid=116576936) is sometimes being at the right place at the right time. We purposely changed our plans to skip South Africa now because the World Cup was there ( to avoid the craziness), but found ourselves [catching the football ( soccer) fever from our European friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/world-cup-football-soccer-in-europe-with-friends.html) during our [camping stay](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html) at our beloved [Barcelona beach resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html).

We stayed longer  just to see this final game here and have never seen so many people in the main square of this resort packed in to watch the [final world cup game](http://www.fifa.com/) on a huge big screen set up outside. The fireworks, anticipation, gross [vuvuzela](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuvuzela) sounds, cheers for both Holland and Spain started early in the day and was already deafening even from our motorhome at a distance,  as the game began. Watching it with Europeans from many countries in this beautiful Catalonia location is something we'll always remember! DaVinci really got into, but Mozart and I joined many of the mom's and kids watching the [movie "UP' on a big screen outside](http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/up/) that started near the end of the game nearby, yet we all celebrated the spectacular Spanish win and crazy celebratory atmosphere. It was impossible not to.

Here are a few photos to share the excitement and fun with you! We are off to France this morning, so quickly getting this up before we hit the road again on our [Grand Tour road trip of Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html)! We have Dutch plates on our motorhome and my sister-in-law is from Holland, so we would be happy no matter who won, but we were rooting for Spain as it has become a home to us. Enjoy!

_"It was sensational, an historic moment for Spanish football. We're not aware of what we've done. We will after some time. It's what we've wanted since we were little. It's a special moment, much more moving than the European championship... It wasn't easy but with luck we managed to win."_ \- Goalkeeper **Iker Casillas**

_"It's incredible. What a joy especially when you see how we won it. There aren't the words to describe what I am feeling. After my goal, I thought about my family and all the people who I love. But the victory is the fruit of a lot of work."_ \- Goal-scorer **Andres Iniesta**

_"We are world champions, it's marvellous, We are absolutely thrilled._" \- **Spanish Queen Sofia**

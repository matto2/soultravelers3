The blazing autumn colors of the [Alsace region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace_wine "wikipedia on Alsace wine") of [France](http://www.infohub.com/TRAVEL/SIT/sit_pages/5419.html "self guided walking tour of Alsace") were such a delight this past fall and thankfully, most of the tourist had gone by the time we arrived, but the [grape harvest](http://za.franceguide.com/maps/france/regions/alsace/The-Grape-Harvest.html?nodeID=144&EditoID=23823 "information about Alsace grape harvest") was in process! This was one of the many [picturesque villages](http://seniortravel.about.com/od/planningyourdreamtrip/a/FrenchWine_3.htm "about.com tour guide info on Alsace Region") along the [Route du Vin](http://www.wein-plus.com/france_guide/Alsace_A4055.html "wine information & history of Route du Vin").We picked a bunch of grapes off these vines and they were the sweetest we have ever tasted!

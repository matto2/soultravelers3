 **PARIS WITH KIDS**

Bringing the kids to Paris? For families considering a [trip to Europe with children](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "trip to Europe with children") ( from toddlers to teens), the City of Lights is a fabulous choice, we highly recommend. Paris is often thought of as an adult destination, but it is perfect for families with no shortage of things to do and activities for children.  
  
One of the best enchanting, educational and free things to do as a family in Paris, is just wandering about, enjoying this beautiful, very walkable city. The Metro subway system is easy, as are the buses and educational and entertaining themselves as you people watch, learn French basics, and grasp the underground Parisian culture on your way to different areas (arrondissements_)_ around the city.  
  
We've spent extensive time in Paris when our daughter was five ( she celebrated her 6th [birthday in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "birthday in paris")...the first of a long trend of [unusual birthdays](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "celebrating birthdays while traveling") on our 6 year non-stop [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world trip")) and again when she was 10 as it is a place we love and we will return again.  
  
I've written many Paris stories like  [Madeline, Linea & d'Orsay](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/madeline-linea.html "family trave paris Madeline, D'Orsay, Linea"), doing [3 Museums in a day](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/3-museums-in-a.html "Paris 3 museums in a day") , plus [Giverny - Monet's Garden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/giverny-monets.html "Giverny monet's garden day trip from Paris"), [Paris Chocolate & Arc de Triumph](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/sun-arc-de-triu.html "Paris chocolate arc de triumph"), and [Sacre Couer & Montmarte](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/sacre-coeur-mon.html#more "Paris with kids Sacre Coer & Montmarte")  from our  Parisien visits.

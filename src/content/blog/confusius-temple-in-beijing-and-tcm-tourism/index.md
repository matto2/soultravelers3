Confucius, Lao Tzu, Taoism and ancient Chinese philosophy and wisdom is alive, well and thriving in China today!  
  
"Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart." Confucius  
  
Perhaps it is a coincidence, because these thoughts are like our own world-view and beliefs, but [all the people](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "local people in China - american learning Mandarin") we met i[n China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-parks-and-martial-arts.html "china travel"), just like the people at our [Mandarin school in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "learning Mandarin in Asia- reasons why"), have a deep appreciation and passion for this ancient wisdom. One of my favorite books, written by one of my dearest friends and teachers is called ["The Tao of Spirit "](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Spirit-John-Roger/dp/0914829335 "Tao of Spirit") a book i[nspired](http://community.beliefnet.com/go_within/blog/2008/05/10/the_tao_of_spirit__peace_theological_seminary "inspiration lao tzu and john roger") by the [Tao Te Ching](http://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&id=LCJfZ4PElmUC&dq=the+tao+of+spirit&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=RNJmGQLdf3&sig=Q_ckqsBfmc5GWYlIH2od0zGGqv4#v=onepage&q=the%20tao%20of%20spirit&f=false "the tao of spirit").

This photo was taken at the [temple of Confucius in Beijing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Confucius "temple of confucius china") ( (北京孔庙/北京孔廟). Thanks to our dear friend Winser Zhao from [China Travel 2.0](http://www.chinatravel20.com/ "Travel to China independently like a local") we met new great friends from [TCM travel health tourism  
](http://en.healthtourism.cn/ "TCM travel health tourism in China")who gave us an amazing two day tour that included this gorgeous temple and the [Beijing Guozijian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guozijian_%28Beijing%29 "Guozijian (Beijing)")  (北京国子监) which is the Imperial College, the central institute of learning in ancient Chinese dynasties and they were built in 1302 and 1306 respectively.  
  
I will be writing much more on this topic, but due to this sacred season, I am taking a Living in Grace retreat online with my church and participants around the world this week, so I will  be spending my time  mostly in meditation, thus will continue with short posts.  
  
What are your favorite Confucius or Lao Tzu or inspiring quotes? Here are a few of mine to add to your holiday spirit:  
  

### “Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.” Confucius  
  

### “At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are and you know what you want.” Lao Tzu  
  

### “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” Confucius  
  

### “Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.” Confucius  
  

### “To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.” Lao Tzu

###   
Ask yourself, “Am I bringing peace and harmony to  
the world? Am I part of the problem, or part of  
the solution?” - John-Roger  
  

### Peace is present right here and now, in ourselves and in everything we do and see. Every breath we take, every step we take, can be filled with peace, joy, and serenity. The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment. ― Thich Nhat Hanh

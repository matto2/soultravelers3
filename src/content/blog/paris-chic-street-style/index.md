Fashion wise, you see a bit of  
everything in Paris. I love just  
wandering the streets

Fashion wise, you see a bit of everything in [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/paris-france-travel-guide-by-mozart.html "Paris family guide"). I love just [wandering the streets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/paris-for-families-walking-the-left-bank.html "Paris for families, walking the streets with kids") and many different neighborhoods of Paris, people watching and [architechtual gazing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/-family-travel-paris-france-louvre-photo.html "Louvre at sunset architectural gazing").  
  
We tend to wear a lot of black, even our [world traveling fashionista](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "world traveling fashionista"), so we always feel at home when we [visit Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/paris-travel-with-kids.html "visit Paris with kids"). Black is a good year-round basic for most cities in Europe. I've been wearing the same black travel "uniform" for 6 years now and love how this [minimalism](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "living a minimalist life with travel") makes my life easy and lets us [pack ultra light](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html "pack ultra light") on our [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world famly trip").  
  
I think the three guys in the photo are tourists, but the girl looks like a Parisian and the shop looks adorable, don't you think? So French! Do you recognize which neighborhood it is? What do you shop for in Paris? We mostly browse for fun or buy a few [souvenirs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/souvenirs-what-do-you-buy-.html "souvenirs") for kidlet.  
  
I've actually been mistaken for a Parisian several times in [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "Paris celebrations"), which always shocks me. People asking me for directions in French. Oh my. Perhaps they need glasses. At any rate, it stroked my ego a bit, even if it did seem strange. How flatterning to be mistaken for a Parisian.  
  
[Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/family-travel-paris-notre-dame-photo.html "Paris travel") on a beautiful day is a remarkable place and one of our favorites on this planet. How about you?Â  Are you a Francofile or Paris lover?

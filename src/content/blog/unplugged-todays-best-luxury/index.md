In this age of digital overload with 24-7 technology that can separate us from the beauty around us as well as friends and family. the peace and serenity of being "unplugged" is perhaps the most valuable luxury today. People are even willing to pay a premium for an ideal opportunity to decompress and escape the endless chatter while traveling. Why?

Despite the wonders of tech today and being a [world traveling digital nomad family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "world traveling digital nomad family"),  some how it saddens me to see people so disconnected from one another on mass transit around the world, lost in their own world, oblivious to the person right next to them or that they are even on a bus or train or plane. Where ever we go we see people plugged into their smart phones and hand held devices

Perhaps the most astonishing example was a traditionally dressed woman in the middle of no where on the one road deep in [Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/family-travel-bhutan-nomads.html "Bhutan") who was dressed in traditional clothes, carrying a handwoven basket on her back filled with fresh picked greens and was talking on a cell phone!  
  
"Technology...is a queer thing. It brings you great gifts with one hand, and it stabs you in the back with the other." C. P. Snow  
  
  
  
"Technology...the knack of so arranging the world that we don't have to experience it."  Frisch  
  
  
**HOW TECHNOLOGY HARMS**  
  
A new survey from Pew Research Center  found that 58 percent of all adults use the internet as a diversion from daily life and that is "vastly higher" than in the mid -2000s. Another survey showed 66% of people are so addicted that they are [afraid to be without their cell phone.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/08/nomophobia-cell-phone-addictio_n_1500670.html "afraid to be without out cell phone") Are we headed in the right direction or just more addiction?  
  
Even more tragic is how many people totally [miss thier kid's childhood](http://www.handsfreemama.com/2012/05/07/how-to-miss-a-childhood/ "Miss your kids childhood through cell phones and tech")  and [neglect their children](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/9280194/Mobile-addict-parents-guilty-of-child-neglect-warns-psychologist.html "neglect their children due to technology") due to this cell phone and tech obsession. I worry about the science that says [cell phones are particularly bad for kids](http://www.internationalparentingassociation.org/BrainDevelopment/cellphones.html "cell phones bad for kids") and teens. Or scientific research that suggests parallels between screen dependency and alcoholism and an association between high levels of screen use with both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  
  
There is plenty of evidence that [too much technology time is harmful to kids](http://www.examiner.com/article/too-much-technology-for-kids-is-bad-for-development-says-new-study "too much technology harms kids") development and we see it first hand when we lapse occasionally and see a huge difference in behaviour without tech limits. Not to mention, I think it is all but impossible to [raise a book reader](http://www.ehow.com/list_6026924_effects-internet-reading-skills.html "internet makes hard to raise a book reading kid") if they are exposed to [too much time on tech](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/ "too much time on tech makes us stupid").  
  
We purposely avoided kidlet ever owning a [Nintendo DS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS "nintendo ds") despite them being very popular with her peers around the world, [she made one herself](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/02/creative-projec.html "creative child makes own nitendo ds") instead which I think is far more creative  and she is a passionate bookaholic. We're not fond of many [video games and their addictive](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/15/news/la-heb-video-games-brain-addiction-20111115 "video games and addiction") and brain altering properties. I find many parents use these things as "babysitters" like the TV, just to keep kids quiet and I prefer my kid has her nose in classic books instead, where she learns effortlessly without the razzle dazzle distractions.  
  
**BENEFITS OF UNPLUGGED KIDS**  
  
I love it that top technology execs in Silicon Valley from Apple, Google, and Hewlett-Packard send their kids to a Waldorf school with no tech according to the [New York Times](y officer of eBay sends his children to a nine-classroom school here. So do employees of Silicon Valley giants like Google, Apple, Yahoo and Hewlett-Packard.  "new york times on tech and kids"). Even as a world traveling digital nomad family who is dependent on tech, we agree wholeheartedly that one must be careful with tech, especially with kids.  
  
We purposely do not even own a smart phone and almost never use a cell phone ( have it only for long stay bases, primarily so friends can call us if necessary). I am such an ungeek that I don't even know how to use a cell phone and hate them, forget about texting, typing with two thumbs seems totally insane to me. Perhaps it's my age or not living a "normal" life, but I like it this way.  
  
One of our dumbest moves was to buy a top of the line  ipod touch last year,  which we hate and still don't know how to use. I thought it would be useful for our around-the-world family trip, but I keep trying to do less and less time online, so it's probably doomed to be a very occasional ( and VERY expensive) toy for kidlet ( hopefully for educational purposes like language learning on the move). I just don't see the need for a handheld device and refuse to be tethered to it or one of the millions sleeping with it.   
  
**WHAT IF YOU CAN'T TOTALLY UNPLUG 24/7/365**  
  
It may seem odd that someone with over 30, 000 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/soultravelers3 "twitter soultravelers3") followers ( started in early 2008) and over 5000 friends/fans/etc on our various [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187?ref=ts "soultravelers3 facebook page") pages, would be an ungeek and worried about the problems with technology today. Most of our tech has begun because of our lifestyle,  but maybe it is because we ARE paperless, long term, world digital nomads with a tween that I can see the many disadvantages as well as the advantages. [Travel 2.0](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/02/twitter-travel-20.html "travel 2.0") has taught me a few things along the way.  
  
I am not sure if one needs to totally unplug 24/7/365,  but sometimes I am tempted to do just that. I do think it is valuable to have many totally unplugged days and many unplugged hours every day.  
  
I do LOVE the advantages of technology and it certainly has been a huge ( and unexpected)  benefit to [our travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "our travel lifestyle"), but it is also a time suck and addictive tool that one has to use very carefully. I don't think I have mastered that yet and perhaps never will, but I hope to teach my child the evils and harms of tech as well as the wonders. Just like junk food, junk tech can be an addiction that destroys life. It can seem harmless in small doses, but it is a slippery slope, getting even harder for the 21st century information-age generation.  
  
We try not to do tech while she is around or awake unless we are doing purposeful pursuits for a limited time ( like her doing school work while I blog and hubs works on finances together in the same room etc). Unlike some [unschool](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "unschool homeschool and travel") parents, we put strong limits on her time online. When she is online, I want her doing valuable work, not learning how to waste time or falling into addictive patterns.  
  
What is your view of being unplugged more? Despite all the wonderful thi ngs about tech, does it cause harm and how can we make less of  the downsides in this information age?  Do you adore the luxury of unplugging?

Meet Samantha  
Mozart started reading these when she was four and  
still really enjoys them!  It is a great way to introduce  
historical fiction to a young reader (most read this in  
the 9-12 year old range). We brought the mini dolls  
with us and a pile of books, but Mozart would love to  
have them all. This is a lovely series and yet another  
way to educate in a fun way. Samantha is  her  favorite  
American girl at the moment and she loves introducing  
her European friends to these books and dolls.

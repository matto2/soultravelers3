When I look at the many sailboats  
in Asia  or watch them sail  
by on the Andaman Sea

When I look at the many sailboats in [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang") or watch them sail by on the [Andaman Se](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/serene-azure-andaman-sea-1.html "Andaman sea")a from my [rental condo in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/penang-apartment-or-condo-rental-plenty-of-choices.html "rental condo Penang vacation home"), it makes me want to go on a sailing adventure like we did in [Turkey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/sailing-away.html "Sail in Turkey") or exploring [islands in Croatia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/croatian-island.html "sailing island hopping croatia") or [sailing Hawaii](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/sailing-the-stunning-napali-coast-of-kauai-hawaii-with-dolphins-snorkeling-fun.html "Sailing Hawaii").  
  
I don't know why, but I also think, like [learning languages](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "learning languages how to raise a bilingual kid") and [playing instruments](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "playing instruments kids"), sailing is something that one should learn in childhood. Perhaps it is because I didn't do these things as a child ( although I did do lots of boating).

Alas, I am still [healing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/health-and-travel/ "travel health")  and we are [working on Mandari](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Learning Mandarin in Asia")n for our daughter, planning a tropical garden for our terrace and more, so haven't gotten to this yet. Sometimes we dream about buying a boat and using that to sail away, but we also dream about building an off the grid cob home somewhere for part of the year with organic gardens and a few animals.  
  
Something to ponder and dream about and wait for the proper time. What do you think? Do you like sailing adventures or would doing it full time be taking on too much for neophyte sailors like us?

We love [traveling the world slowly](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "traveling the world slowly") and experiencing things from the ground level, thus driving our motorhome is a [fabulous way to see Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "fabulous way to see Europe"). We also do a lot of biking, walking and using mass transit and sometimes we use trains, buses, ferries.  
  
Because [Europe is very dense in amazing destinations](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Europe amazing destinations for vacation") to see and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, we tend to usually drive just short distances and park our RV for a few days to a month or more to relax and explore at a leisurely pace. [Campsites usually have pools](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "Europe campsites have pools and luxuries") , [kids club](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "kids clubs europe")s and [exercise](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/exercise-and-travel-how-to-stay-in-shape-while-traveling.html "exercise and travel") rooms for family entertainment when one is not touring, plus it's [easy to meet European families](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/international-kids-water-fun-european-style.html "easy to meet european families camping").

Loved these houseboats in France and one of these days we wil do some French barge travel.

[![Beautiful French architecture](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133f2f6f375970b.jpg "Beautiful French architecture")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133f2f6f375970b.jpg)

The photo's taken in this particular [European Grand Tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "European grand tour") was the section around France to re-explore some areas more deeply that we had seen before, see some travel icons and discover some new hidden gems off the beaten path. Most of these were taken from Provence to [Dordogne](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/darling-dordogne-vacation-holiday-for-families-in-france.html "dordogne vacation"), but we also did the Loire Valley and [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/paris-france-travel-guide-by-mozart.html "Paris guide by kid"). ( Still need to get those photos and stories up, but it's helpful hopefully, to get a sense of what a [Europe road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/rv-in-europe-road-trip-europe-camping-european-style.html "Europe road trip") is like.)

Our style of [European road trip plannin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-europe-plan-then-improvise.html "European road trip planning")g includes LOTS of improvising. Often we travel a very short distance like we did between [Nimes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-nimes-france-.html "Nimes, france") and [Arles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/arles-france-vacation.html "Arles, France Vacation or holiday"). Sometimes we stay longer because we like an area like we did with the [amazing Camargue](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html "amazing camargue, France") and while visiting Agde because of the kids clubs there. Our biggest goal that year was to return to Paris because Mozart hadn't been there since we [celebrated her 6th birthday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "celebrating birthday in paris") there at the beginning of our family world trip in 2006. 

[![French country living](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134861a7a1b970c.jpg "French country living")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134861a7a1b970c.jpg)

Thus, sometimes, we do faster travel and we had basked long enough in the [south of France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beach-fun-french-riviera-style-france-family-travel-bucket-and-spades-provence-south-of-france.html "south of france") that year.We got up early in [Avignon](http://twitpic.com/2hr5oh "Avignon, France beautiful photo"), Mozart did a little artwork project  while we packed things up and headed out to Rocamadour. We missed beautiful Rocamadour last time in the Dordogne, but it is to the far east of the region, so perfect on our central run up the middle of France towards the Loire and Paris.

[![Dordogne a popular vacation destination in France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134861a7aed970c.jpg "Dordogne a popular vacation destination in France")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134861a7aed970c.jpg) 

[![yes, they have windmills in France too!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134861a7bbe970c.jpg "yes, they have windmills in France too!")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134861a7bbe970c.jpg) 

[![beautiful ancient towns in France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133f2f700da970b.jpg "beautiful ancient towns in France")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133f2f700da970b.jpg)

Alas, perfect plans sometimes go astray. After seven hours of driving and ready to rest, we found the tiny, cliff side roads to Rocamadour too scary for our old, very heavy ( weighted down with homeschool books and a full sized digital piano) RV. We have done our time on scary roads in [Santorini](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/hello-goodbye-s.html "santorini"), [Delphi](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/delphi.html "delphi, Greece"), [San Sebastian](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/seaside-resort-san-sebastian-spain-donostia.html "San Sebastian") and more, so didn't want to do it again. 

  [![French country side](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133f2f70ed1970b.jpg "French country side")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133f2f70ed1970b.jpg)  
  

We tried a few different routes in, but then finally decided to add another few hours and head to Limoges further north which has a good campsite open all year. The good news about a long drive is I got to do some work on photos and some writing while DaVinci drove and I took these photos along the way. 

[![beautiful Carcassone Castle in France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134861a86a9970c.jpg "beautiful Carcassone Castle in France")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134861a86a9970c.jpg)

It was especially fun to see [Carcasonne](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/carcassonne-med.html "visiting carcassonne, france") from the road as we had been there in 2006 and discovering Carlucet was a treat. The road tolls are small when one is doing short trips, but they are painful for DaVinci when we do these long drives.  
  
I actually wrote most of this post while doing this trip, but just discovered it again, so thought you might enjoy it now.  
  
Have you done a [European or French road trip?](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "European road trip in a camper van") Or would you like to? We look forward to doing many more as the next language that our 11 year old wants to learn in French and we adore Europe.

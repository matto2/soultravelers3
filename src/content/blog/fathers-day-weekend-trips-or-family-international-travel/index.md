On [Dad's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%27s_Day "fathers day"), lets make a [tribute to all the traveling fathers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/happy-fathers-day-traveling-dads.html "fathers that travel ") who do family travel... be it a weekend getaway , a week's vacation, two week's holiday, a year's [family world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "family world trip") or an open ended [family travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family travel lifestyle") ( like we have been living these past 5 years...almost into our 6th year of non-stop travel).  
  
In today's busy world, just having time together to explore the world with one's children means so much to both the father and the child/or children. Some of my happiest memories of childhood were family trips...so they last a lifetime.  
  
"The father who would taste the essence of his fatherhood must turn back from the plane of his experience, take with him the fruits of his journey and begin again beside his child, marching step by step over the same old road. " Angelo Patri  
  
One of our primary reasons for choosing our [free travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel lifestyle") was so my husband and child would have more time to bond and be together. As older parents we are well aware of how fast childhood passes and neither one of us wanted to miss a second of it.  
  
She is 10 now, soon to be 11, and it seems like only yesterday that [she was born](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/leap-of-faith.html "leap of faith in travel"). She was 5 when we began our world tour and although that also seems like yesterday, I am often shocked when I see the [photos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/goodbye-paris.html "family vacation paris with kids") of her at the [beginning of our world journey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/windmills-insid.html#more "holland kids and windmills") to see how small she was.  
  
Our open ended journey  has proven to be one of our best decisions ever and we are grateful that we are constantly together and she has such a rich relationship with her father, blessed with more time together than most humans get.

I love how this inspiring  story tells about the great things a father's love can accomplish.  
  
I am grateful to my own father who gave me the gift of loving travel, curiousity, adventurousness  and life long learning. He taught us to camp, do distance travel, take calculated risks, do things our own way, not follow the crowd.  
  
"My father didn't tell me how to live; he lived, and let me watch him do it."  Clarence Kelland  
  
This photo was taken in [Wadi Rum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi_Rum "wadi rum") on our recent [trip to Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "trip to Jordan"). We were doing a thrilling 4X4 trek deep into the desert and following running wild camels as I took this. We watched the serene sunset and the full moon rise in a Bedouin camp there and later ate a delicious  traditional meal cooked under the sand.( More coming about that soon).  
  
"A child looks up at the stars and wonders. Great fathers put a child on his shoulders and helps them to grab a star."  
  
What are your happiest memories of travel or exploration or learning with your father?

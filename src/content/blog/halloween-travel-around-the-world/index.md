We had an enchanting [Halloween in Umbria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/ahhhumbria.html "Halloween in Italy") when Mozart was eight among all the colorful vineyards with a costume we bought earlier in [Turkey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/sirince-charms.html "turkey travel") ( that she also wore to [tour Ephesus](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/ephesus-stellar.html "touring ephesus with kids") to add to the excitement for a young one and it's a [sweet souvenir](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/souvenirs-what-do-you-buy-.html "souvenirs and travel")).  
  
![Halloween travel around the world - decorated skulls in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0865a1f970c.png)  
  
 If you are looking to scare yourself silly, you might like the [decorated skulls at the “Beinhaus” in Austria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/10/salt-mine-iron.html "decorated skulls austria") or the [bone church in Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/book-fairwifi-b.html "bone church portugal") or maybe one of the [torture museums](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/11/more-santillana.html "torture museums Europe") in Europe, like this one in Spain.  
  
![Halloween travel around the world - torture museum](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0865ab2970c.png)  
  
  
Mozart actually loved these sites and found them fascinating as most kids do, but they were too much for my taste. She also adored the [buried alive bodies from Pompeii](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/pompeiiburied-a.html "buried alive body Pompeii") which is another possible Halloween themed getaway if your kids like Horrible History kind of books.

During the last nine years on our [world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family trip around the world - long term travel"), we have had some fascinating [Halloweens, celebrating them around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/halloween-around-the-world.html "celebrating Halloween around the world").

Even in places that don't [celebrate this holiday](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/halloween-jack-o-lantern-fun.html "Halloween and pumpkins") ,like Mozart did last year with a [DIY Halloween costume](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/10/easy-cute-cheap-diy-halloween-costume.html "DIY halloween costume cheap and cute") in [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/asia/ "Asia travel tips").

If you are traveling with a kid on Halloween, there is always a way to celebrate.This will be our first year of celebrating Halloween in Texas and Mozart is going to be her favorite [Greek](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/greece/ "Greece travel tips") [Goddess, Aphrodite.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/hugging-aphrodi.html "Aphrodite greek Goddess best ruins to visit")

It is going to be hard to beat the Halloween in [California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "california")  while visiting grandma,(the first Halloween at home in 6 years), but this year [Mozart will be singing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/10/mozart-sings-at-the-house-of-blues.html "Mozart singing at the house of Blues - talented teen") / performing, so that will be a new thrill.  
  
![Halloween travel around the world-catching candy at the Halloween parade](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6fc54bc970b.png)  
  
When I was very sick in 2011, we went home for 5 months, so  Mozart  got to celebrate with old friends and relatives in the [beach parade](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/enchanting-halloween-california-style-1.html "halloween california beach") (that she did for the first five years of her life and still remembered). I think she got to cherish it more than if we had done it every year and was the perfect age for it.  
  
![Halloween travel around the world-celebrating Halloween at the beach](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb07a18c09970d.png)  
  
  
Combining sun, sea, beach and too much candy like only a lovely [beach town in California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "california beach town - capitola") can do.  
  
![Halloween travel around the world-pumpkin display in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6fc54d4970b.png)  
  
  
Our first [European travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/best-places-to-visit-in-europe.html "best places to visit in Europe") year's [Halloween while on the road](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/happy-halloween.html "Halloween in Europe on road trip")  was quite different in coastal [Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/10/what-to-do-in-spain-the-ultimate-checklist.html#more "Spain - best tips checklist"), but fun too.

One of her [favorite Halloween](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html "favorite halloween in NYC")'s was when we were in New York City to meet the disadvanted kids in Harlem, Bronx, Queens etc. that we were taking with us [around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world") virtually.

We connected with Conde Nast travel writer [Wendy Perrin](http://www.wendyperrin.com/ "wendy perrin") and her family for a Halloween we will never forget. That year she went as her heroine Hermione from Harry Potter, a costume we purchased at [Hogwarts in England](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=FSB7Gictlag "flying with harry potter at hogwarts in UK").  
  
![Halloween around the world - dracula in Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6fc55b3970b.png)  
  
The next year she tweaked that costume in [Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "barcelona") to turn it into a vampire theme as they scurried around one of our [favorite campsites](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "beach resort campground barcelona") trick or treating.  
  
![Halloween around the world - Bora Bora hula girl](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6fc55d1970b.png)  
  
We seem to have a [world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "world trip") habit now of buying costumes in one place and using them in another. When we discovered that we would be in [Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora vacation") on Halloween, we bought a hula girl costume in [Kauai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html "kauai, Hawaii") on the way there. It was the perfect costume to trick or treat in [Tahiti](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/the-ultimate-tahiti-vacation-on-a-backpacker-low-budget.html "tahitit travel tips")!

Like her unusual [birthday celebrations around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "celebrating birthdays around
the world"), Mozart is going to have some wild and crazy Halloween memories. And that doesn't even count her other opportunities of dressing in costume for celebrating things like [Carnival in Spain.

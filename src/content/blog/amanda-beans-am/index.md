Amanda Bean's Amazing Dream  
Mozart has long loved this book and it is a fun way to help kids to understand multiplication and the and joy of math. A good mathematical story! Paperback and skinny, so easy to take along and allows effortless math education that a child can self select.Unschooling is served well by books like this that teach without a child even knowing that the fun thing she is doing is learning.

Mmmmm...we had one of our best meals in Europe at Botin. It was a splurge for us, but we were starving by the time we got there and very much in the mood for the exquisite, simple and delicious food that they serve. We had loved the food in Morocco, but we had ten days of mostly tagines and were ready to eat a salad and such without excess worry.

Botin is the oldest Restaurant in Madrid and has a spectacular reputation, so we had to try it. Their most famous dish is suckling pig which is called “Cochinillo”in Spain and is very popular. We don’t eat pork, so had to pass on that, although I have heard so many raves, it was tempting. DaVinci went for their second and almost equally adored baby lamb (“Cordero”).

Mozart had been drooling over salads all through Morocco, so that is the first thing that she wanted. We also got her some chicken and potatoes and I got the steak. We started with their gazpacho which was the best that I have had in Spain (and I have had some great ones). It was all melt-in-your-mouth scrumptious and the service was divine. To top it off we loved the Spanish red wine and the flan and mousse desert was out of this world.

Like the place we ate in Burgundy that was a wise splurge, this one just seemed right. We have a really low budget for food and usually live pretty simply, cooking most of our own food, but once in a while you just need to eat like a king.

Even though we could not eat them, the little pigs really fascinated us. They had a little room with a fire oven just below the dining room and next to the kitchen with shelves full of little piggies. I have never seen anything like it, so of course I had to take some pics to share them with you. Gee, I hope they don’t serve them with their heads on and all.

Afterwards we were strolling along headed for the Plaza Mayor, when we noticed a barber shop with an old fashioned chair outside next door. Some people were taking their picture in it, so perhaps it is a landmark. All I knew was Mozart desperately needed her bangs cut and DaVinci needed a haircut, so I said why not. We are getting good at finding great spots around the globe for haircuts and this one worked really well. In five minutes time they looked so much better.We were ready for more sight seeing and onto the Prado!

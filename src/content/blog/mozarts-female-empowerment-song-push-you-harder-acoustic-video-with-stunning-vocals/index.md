Mozart premiered the pared down acoustic version of ["Push You Harder"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2018/10/-mozart-dee-smashes-the-patriarchy-in-girl-power-song-push-you-harder.html#more "Mozart girl-power song \"Push You Harder\"") on [CelebSecrets](https://celebsecrets.com/mozart-is-smashing-the-patriarchy-with-stripped-down-version-of-push-you-harder-premiere/ "CelebSecrets  mozart push you harder premiere") and then released on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpZ1d3XgqoL/ "Teen singer Mozart on Instagram MuzicbyMozart ") ( where she is an Influencer) and [Youtube](%20https://bit.ly/1VsHSZp "MuzicbyMozart Youtube ").  
  
 “As much as I love the music video we made for this song, I  wanted to do an acoustic version to show the raw, artistic side of the song and haunting lyrics. Sometimes paring everything away to the ultimate simplicity helps shed more light on a topic,” Mozart states. “Just me and the piano touching one on one to my fans and viewers telling this familiar tale we live and providing inspiration for change. To get that change women and young people must use their power to vote and stand up to injustices. So I think the timing is perfect.”

“I wrote ‘Push You Harder’ a few days after I turned 17 last fall when there was a lot going on with the beginning of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements,” Mozart tells _Celeb Secrets_. “I care a lot about these issues and want to do my part to make our world a better place for everyone, so I wanted to write a girl power anthem that had an important message but was also fun, edgy and uplifting.”

In the "Push You Harder" Official music video above you can see Mozart paying homage to Lady Justice, the Suffragettes, Amelia Earhart, Rosie the Riveter, Rosa Parks, Wonder Woman, Maya Angelou, Frida Kahlo, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Women’s March and even Mother earth.  She wrote/directed/edited/produced the video as well as writing and singing the song. She wanted to include some shocking images to match the lyrics like "Don't shoot me in my chest, and tell me to stop bleeding" but she also wanted it to be about transforming the pain into something positive.

We love Europe, so we are planning to do more extensive travel there soon. We still have our camper in covered storage in Barcelona, so we are looking into doing a cool budget revamp!

I love this budget renovation of a similar camper ( although ours is 1994 European one and this is a 1979 American one) that I found on [Live a Wilder Life](https://www.liveawilderlife.com). They did it all for under 650 dollars! Both of these campers are bigger than ours, but gives you the idea we are going for. This second photo is from [Poverbs31girl](https://proverbs31girl.com/my-500-camper-remodel-that-i-did-all-by-myself/) blog & it is closer to our set up where our table is directly across from our kitchen area ( and was done for 500 dollars) with 2 small beds in back near bathroom ( but a little different set up)!

We are making plans now and will blog about the process as we do it here and on Youtube and social media.

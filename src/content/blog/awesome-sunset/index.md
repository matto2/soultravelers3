One of the great pleasures of life and our [trip around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html#more "trip around the world") is viewing [amazing sunsets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/family-travel-photo-spain-family-travel-sunset-on-road-trip-in-europe-andalusia-4hww-rolf-potts-tim-.html "amazing sunsets") and [sunrises](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/beautiful-sunrises-and-sunsets.html "sunrises and sunsets") in so many different locations. The ones here in [our Penang apartment](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Our penang apartment"), give me joy almost every day. I have taken so many photos of them that I think I could almost do a blog just about sunrises and sunsets.  
  
We are wishing our American friends and family a wonderful [Memorial Day Weekend](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/italian-memoria.html "Memorial day weekend"). We've had some fun ones [roadtripping Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "road-tripping europe") and [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "Spain vacation"), now this is our first in Asia. It feels like a holiday here too because Mozart just finished her exams at her [Mandarin School](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Mandarin school") and now has two weeks off and DaVinci's birthday always falls near this holiday.  
  
We thought about doing a little trip, but my [travel health](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "travel health") issues remain and I am on such a restricted diet, it would be too hard right now, but hopefully soon. We will make it to see Men in Black 3 and Mozart has loads of plans with her friends, including many karoke get-togethers at the mall.  
  
What are your plans this weekend and holiday?

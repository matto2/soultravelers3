 We love [libraries, reading](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/10-tips-to-raise-a-reader-book-lover.html "how to raise a reader") and how much both have helped us on our travels and Mozart's [world schooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/curriculum-vitae-for-a-gifted-child-world-schooling.html "world school CV for Mozart") education. So we were delighted when Dallas Public Library asked her to do a speech about her experience of world travel.

Mozart has been so busy with her singing and acting that I am late posting this which took place almost a year ago.

We've use Dallas as our base for the last year and are about to head to NYC and then onto Los Angeles as our new base because Mozart needs to be there for her singing and acting.  
  
We have so enjoyed using the Dallas Public Library system and it was absolutely a big help no doubt in Mozart getting the High Honors Award from Johns Hopkins University CTY program (for getting a higher SAT score at 13 than 96% of seniors taking the test). I have no doubt that her huge reading list of classics etc helped that a lot. Some she read here and some from libraries in Asia and around the world.

It was actually quite amazing for all of us to see Mozart up there next to a big screen with many of her [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCawzFLlyXP4qtq-rn3N-GBQ "soultravelers3 youtube channel about travel ") from our travels. It has been a dream childhood for sure and almost made me cry with gratitude and pride.

One of the super sweet things that happened that day was an African-American woman and her son just happened to be in the library and walked by just as Mozart began. Serendipitously, she followed her whim and came.   
  
She came up to us afterwards and was so thrilled, thinking God had brought her! She has always wanted to travel, but didn't know what we do was even possible. Mozart's speech gave them a whole new way at looking at life and possibilities.

That kind of reaction is one of my favorite things about this blog.  
  
I am happy that Mozart can pass on this information in her own way from her experience.   
  
Libraries are wonderful in so many ways!

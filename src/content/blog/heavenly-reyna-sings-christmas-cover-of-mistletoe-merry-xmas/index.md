2019 has been such a hectic year, that it's great to be able to just rest and spend time with family as we prepare for a new year and new decade! Thank you so much for all your support of [Heavenly](https://www.instagram.com/iamheavenlyreyna/ "Heavenly Reyna singer actress on Instagram") and our blog! We are excited about this new decade, are you?

Who knows where life leads us & where our children will take us? It is all only because of [Heavenly](https://heavenlyreyna.com "Heavenly Reyna singer actress songwriter ") that we began this blog and our decade of world travels as a digital nomad family on the move.

[Heavenly](https://soundcloud.com/heaven "Heavenly Reyna singer songwriter ") has come a long way from those early preschool years above, singing as she cuts down the family Christmas tree and making up songs at four as she decorates the tree, ....to now working as a SAG lead dramatic actress in two movies this year, one where she sings five of her original songs! One [movie where Heavenly kills Nazi's](http://soultravelers3new.local/2019/12/heavenly-reyna-stars-in-glass-darkly-movie-.html#more "Heavenly Reyna stars in movie \"Glass Darkly\"")! Both release in 2020, so we will keep you posted when we know more. She also did a [commercial](https://www.instagram.com/p/B06WhjyAX-M/ "Heavenly Reyna actress in red robin burger commercial "), a pilot, created many songs in various studios and released her song ["Push You Harder" which got great reviews.](https://www.laweekly.com/mozart-composes-female-empowerment-anthem/ "Heavenly Reyna in LA weekly for push you harder song")

 Fun to look back at [Heavenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5n67SVQVB8 "Heavenly singing Push You Harder ") at 13, in this medley, performing at Six Flags in Dallas and seeing photos of her many happy Christmas moments in Spain, China, California, tropical Malaysia & various places around the world on our global tour.

Let's not forget this fun xmas video, where [Heavenly](https://twitter.com/heavenlyreyna "Heavenly Reyna actress singer songwriter ") at 15/16 sings with a friend and her Dad gets the honor of playing Santa Claus!  
  
[Heavenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uueS1p-Ydg "Heavenly Reyna actor singer Tedtalk") was always so musical & animated as a baby and child, I suppose I should have expected a singing, songwriting, acting career, but she was also so exceptional at math, languages, archeology, science etc., that we really had no idea that this is where we'd be today. As a kid her goal was always to go to Harvard, but destiny stepped in and this early peak career called to her & started blossoming. 

Celebrate this holiday season with love and just enjoy what adventure you and yours are leading you towards! Let's make it the best decade yet!

Sometimes glorious like at a beach or pool and sometimes hardy, like perched on a door ledge on a busy street, but a mobile office is almost always [interesting](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/laptop-madness.html#more)!  We have [become masters](http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?STORY_ID=10950378) at finding wifi and setting up our office on the go in every kind of place on four continents. We haven't caught all of our "office" locations, didn't even think about the [oddness](http://www.stevehargadon.com/2008/10/moving-toward-web-20-in-k-12-education.html) of our " [3 laptop family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/3-laptop-fami-2.html#more)" existence until fairly recently, but thought we would share a few that we have remembered to catch on film.

There really are some of me somewhere too, but I couldn't seem to find any for this post. It happens that I am the most active photographer and these two are my  favorite models. You would never guess, that I am also the one who spends the most time online too, would you?

Are you getting as sick of seeing us in the same old clothes for years, as we are sick of wearing them over and over?  ( Actually, we have gotten used to this simplicity which saves so much time, since there is not much to decide on). Never fear, we will head to NYC soon to see all the disadvantaged school kids that follow us virtually through the award winning nonprofit [Reach The World](http://www.reachtheworld.org/journey/journeytoeurope) and while we are there we hope to find some sponsors that might want to see their clothes regularly on our blog! If you know any possibilities send them our way! Thankfully, Mozart is a skinny mini who can wear clothes for years. That is the same size four outfit that she wore when we left! We found frugal living fun long before it was a hot trend.

Prizes which is pretty impressive

Yes! We were in Oslo in the room where they give the [Nobel Peace Prizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize) which is pretty impressive, especially for a little girl who had just turned 8 in nearby Stockholm where she also visited [the museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Museum) for the [Nobel Prize.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize) Yet another amazing family travel adventure in "[roadschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/home-school.html#more)" and [education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/home-school-and.html)!

She practiced her own acceptance speech on the very stage that  [President Obama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) was on today as well as past winners like the [Dalai Lama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama) and [Desmond Tutu.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu) We were there in September 2008 and had the [Oslo City Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_City_Hall)  (where it is held), totally to ourselves, so she was free to imagine big and plant an ideal seed for her own peaceful future.

She watched [Obama's Inauguration speech in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/01/family-travel-photospain-obama-inauguration-09.html) and was curious about today's events based on that, her travel experiences, reading and our family discussions. The Nobelprize.org site has some [good information for kids](http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/) and even fun games like this [Peace Dove Game that lets kids save the world](http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/peace/nuclear_weapons/) from the proliferation of nuclear weapons!

According to Nobel,  the Peace Prize recipient "during the preceding year... shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.

It seems [confusing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/norman-solomon/mr-president-war-is-not-p_b_386955.html) to [many](http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/obama-and-the-nobel-peace-prize/) how a war president who just days ago [ordered 30,000 more U.S. troops into Afghanistan](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/10/obama-nobel-peace-prize-p_n_386824.html) could be getting a "peace prize" but perhaps that is because he was nominated in October and had been elected on [a promise of change](http://www.bravenewtraveler.com/2008/11/02/8-nobel-peace-prize-laureates-on-how-leadership-can-end-war/). Perhaps it was for the "hope of peace". Sadly, President Obama disappoints us as much as President Bush, but I suppose that is how many feel about their political leaders today in many places around our planet. I find politics and politicians frustrating.

That said, I won't give up the dream of peace for our planet or [teaching my child peaceful ways.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/michelangelo-in.html)  Like Ghandi's famous quote I believe strongly that:

"We must become the change we want to see in the world."

and like Michael Jackson's famous song, we must all begin [by looking at the man in the mirror.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGeZYednWtI&feature=fvw) That's why we are big fans of [The Institute of Individual and World Peace](http://www.iiwp.org/) and this quote from the founder:

"Individual peace is the prelude to world peace.  
Individual peace starts with you, regardless of what anybody else does."  
  
John-Roger

We are grateful that there is a prestigious peace prize and that we got to learn more about it on our travels and get that "close up" view. It's a hands-on experience that will stay with Mozart forever.

How do you practice being more peaceful in your life? We find our extended travel and deep immersion into other cultures a fabulous way to learn more about peace. We don't always do it perfectly, but I think over all, our travels have made us more peaceful as a family and as individuals.

We did really enjoy our time in [Oslo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-norway-oslo-vigeland-sculpture-park-mother-child.html) and [Norway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/family-travel-norway-in-a-nutshell-norwegian-fijord-photo.html) and still need to complete many stories about our wonderful travels in Scandinavia. Today's events just brought back great memories and a teachable moment for our child this afternoon in sunny Andalusia and just made me want to share a little with you too!

I'm glad that this day of awarding a peace prize gives us all another opportunity to contemplate peace and consider how we can bring ourselves into greater peace. Wouldn't it be wonderful if each of us could strive for our own peace prize every day?

"Responsibility does not only lie with the leaders of our countries or with those who have been appointed or elected to do a particular job. It lies with each of us individually. Peace, for example, starts within each one of us. When we have inner peace, we can be at peace with those around us."

Dalai Lama

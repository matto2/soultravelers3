Bring Your Own Children  
This book was written by a renown psychologist who took a sabbatical with her family in South America. She gives lots of emphasis of the importance of traveling with children and lots of practical details about how to do that, especially extensive travelÂ  in South America. Their 8 year old son writes in every chapter about his experience and what he liked and did not like.

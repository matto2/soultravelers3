Looking for a Paleo pasta [recipe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/recipes/ "Healthy paleo recipes") that is homemade, healthy, Grain-Free and Gluten-Free? This is a fairly easy recipe that Mozart adapted from our [Paleo/Primal Tortilla recipe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/07/easy-paleo-primal-tortillas-recipe-mexican-food.html "paleo- primal tortilla recipe and Mexican food") and tastes great if you are missing those carby meals like spaghetti.

Due to our [cavity healing and prevention](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "curing gum disease and cavities naturally") diet, Mozart sometimes misses the comfort-food satisfaction of grains, but this a yummy replacement that she can make for herself or the whole family.  
  
**PALEO PASTA ( GRAIN FREE, GLUTEN FREE) RECIPE**  
  
INGREDIENTS:  
  
2Â  Eggs  
  
1 teaspoon melted coconut oil  
  
1 tablespoon water  
  
1/4 cup Arrowroot powder  
  
1 teaspoon coconut flour  
  
pinch of salt  
  
( This makes 2 tortilla's so one can double this recipe or even quadruple it as Mozart often does, then stores the extra for other meals).

DIRECTIONS:  
  
1) Crack the eggs into a bowl and mix in the coconut oil and water.  
  
2) Add the dry ingredients and mix well to combine  
  
3) Pour about 1/3 of the batter into a frying pan (with coconut oil to prevent sticking) and use medium heat. Quickly roll the skillet around to evenly coat the bottom.  
  
4) Cook for about 1 minute on each side.  
  
Then just cut them into strips with a knife, add some organic, bottled red sauce of your choice and grassfed meatballs or hamburger and you have a delicious meal!

My little bookworm Mozart likes to eat it for lunch while [reading a book](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/10-tips-to-raise-a-reader-book-lover.html "how to raise a reader")! Doesn't it look good?

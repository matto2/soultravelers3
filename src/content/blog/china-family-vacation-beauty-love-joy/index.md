Some how I didn't expect that and probably would never have [visited China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "visit china") if it wasn't for my [child learning Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "child learning Mandarin").

Is China on your bucket list or have you been? What do you want to know?

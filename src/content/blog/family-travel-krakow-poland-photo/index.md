[Family travel in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel in Europe") can often mean taking a carriage ride around an ancient city. We have taken them in [Prague](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/11/the-golden-city.html "Prague family vacation "), [Seville with family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/ole-sublime-sev.html "seville vacation with family "), [Brugge](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/folk-lace-museu.html "Brugge family vacation"), and more. They add educational value to a family vacation and kids always love them.  
  
In the beautiful and biggest main square in Europe,( [Rynek Glowny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Market_Square,_Krak%C3%B3w "main square krakow")) center of  UNESCO Heritage Site [Krakow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w "krakow")/ Cracow, we decided to just watch and listen to them as they add color and remembrance of how things use to be in this ancient pretty city. I can hear the clomp, clomp, clomp of horses hooves just looking at this photo.  
  
We were sitting at one of the many cafes that line the Main Market Square having a bite and some tea when this carriage went by. One can see the famous [Sukiennice/Cloth Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiennice "cloth hall krakow") in the background which dominantes the [Old Town center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Old_Town "old town krakow") and one of the cities most recognizable icons.  
  
Krakow was one of the few cities in [Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland") that was not destroyed in the war and it's oldest,  so enchanting, fairytale-like, rich in history and with a thriving arts community. We loved our [visit to Krakow](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-cool-krakow-bb-poland-best-budget-hotel.html "vacation Krakow/cracow") and lucked out running into a to-die-for [delicious dumpling festival](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-photo-poland-krakow-dumpling-festival-pierogi-value-of-vacations-for-kids-world-peace.html "delicious dumpling festival krakow poland") complete with colorful native costumes and traditonal music.  
  
There are many ways to visit an old town. We have done it on bikes, walking, buses, subways , boats and trams and have appreciated each ways unique advantages. Cariages are romantic for couples and also gives kids a hands on view of history that makes the stories come alive.  
  
Have you done a carriage ride tour around a city?

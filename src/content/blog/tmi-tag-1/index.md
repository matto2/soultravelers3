Mozart had a blast making it,so we hope you enjoy it!  She did it in one take since we were busy moving this week ( more on that soon!) and only had 18 minutes on the camera. Then we edited it to add a little spice ( but challenging as we had to finally buy a new Mac and the tech has changed sooo much since we bought ours in 2006!).Yikes!

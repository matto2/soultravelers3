**CHEAPEST LODGING IN PARIS ...AND LOVELY!**  
  
Yes, cheaper than hostels and very comfortable...you can even rent a furnished cabin, tent or trailer if you want. In my opinion, this is not just the cheapest way to [visit Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/family-travel-paris-notre-dame-photo.html "visit paris"), but the [best way](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html "Best family travel tips")! We have been [camping Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/camping-europe/ "camping europe") and doing [road trips around Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html#more "road trips around Europe") for months at a time for almost 8 years now on our [world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "how to travel the world with a family") and find these the 3 [best campgrounds](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "best campgrounds in Europe") in [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/paris-france-travel-guide-by-mozart.html "Paris travel guide").

Can you imagine this view of the Seine with a glass of wine in your hand relaxing after a day of [touring around Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/-family-travel-paris-france-louvre-photo.html "touring around Paris - family travel") ,listening to the crickets and katydids chirp on a summer night, trees swaying in the gentle breeze as the moon comes out and a slow barge ambles by as you recline in your chaise lounge near the shore?_

_These are the moments that make me smile with glee as we live the life of kings on a tiny budget, [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "traveling around the world -how to do extended travel") non-stop on $23/day per person. No, it is not a 5 star hotel, but in some ways better and I remember those nights fondly as we discussed our day in this lovely private, woodsy setting.  
  
**1) CAMPING ON THE SEINE - BOIS DE BOULOGNE**  
  
[Royalty use to hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bois_de_Boulogne "bois de boulogne history paris") in the beautiful 25 acres that is now [Bois de Boulogne in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/paris-bois-de-b.html "camping bois de boulogne") where one can camp along the Seine! Where else can you get a huge space to stay in [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/is-paris-for-lovers-.html "visiting Paris") for barely twenty something dollars a night (even  less for tent campers)? Prices vary by season and options you pick.You can even see the [Eiffel tower](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "Eiffel  Tower travel paris") from the camp!

[Bois de Boulogne Camp Site](http://www.paris-tourisme.com/campsite/ "camping Paris") is not really a secret as it is the [only campsite right in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/irish-girls-inv.html "campsite in Paris "). It is on the western edge of the [16th arrondissement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_arrondissement_of_Paris "16th arrondissement of Paris"),on 17 acres just 15 minutes from the [Champs-Elysees](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/sun-arc-de-triu.html "Champs-Elysees for Paris travelers") open 365 days a year with its own store, restaurant, take out food, rentals etc and has 435 pitches for camping and is usually pretty full and popular with [Europeans](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/international-kids-water-fun-european-style.html "European camping with kids"). Sadly, few Americans know about this low budget gem.

**CAMPING PARIS WITH KIDS**  
  
[Camping](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "Camping with kids and kids clubs in Europe") [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/eating-in-paris.html "Paris travel") rocks for young adults, [traveling retirees](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retirement travel"), but is especially [rewarding with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "Paris travel with kids") and [best budget bargain for families](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/paris-for-families-walking-the-left-bank.html "Paris for families on a budget"). When you are not out [touring Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/la-samaritaine-paris-architecture.html "touring paris architecture") or seeing [museums with your kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html "best tips for museums with kids"), they can play in nature, near one of the [best parks in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/best-paris-parks-gardens-and-fountains.html "best parks in Paris") and meet other kids from many countries.

Bois de Boulogne camping is within walking distance to  the famous “Petite Train” (takes one to Le Jardin d’Acclimatation which is Paris’ biggest children’s amusement park) and near the Porte Maillot Metro/RER station. The park areas across the street have some cool lakes and one of the [best playgrounds in Europe!](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/-best-playground-in-europe-guggenheim-in-bilbao-spain-more.html "best playgrounds in Europe")  
  
[![cute girl camping in Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192aaabd404970d.png "cute girl camping in Paris")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192aaabd404970d.png)  
  
This campsite is older, but  has large clean showers that are even heated in winter time with plenty of hot water, there are two Carrefours ( hypermarkets) within 10 minutes walk and other useful small supermarkets within walking distance,and the shuttle to Port Maillot runs regularly. It is really quiet and peaceful during the day ( everyone leaves in the morning)  for [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") types like us that lke to [hang out](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/a-day-of-rest-r.html "hang out and travel") and [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschool and travel") when not touring.  
  
[![cute girl exploring Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192aaabe2ca970d.jpg "cute girl exploring Paris")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192aaabe2ca970d.jpg)  
  
  
We mostly cook our own [healthy, cheap food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "how to eat healthy cheap food in Europe") but the restaurant serves various salads, sandwiches, pizza etc,like most [campsites in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/rv-in-europe-road-trip-europe-camping-european-style.html "campsites in Europe"), they also have [fresh bread daily](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/european-foodie-delights-freshly-baked.html "fresh bread europe bakery") and a pretty decent fruit, veggie and wine selection.  
  
I suggest you buy carnets de ticket at Porte Maillot Metro for bus/metro/RER (E12.90 for 10/E1.70 each, E1 for child each way). The bus from the campsite (E1.70 single trip) runs every half hour and takes you straight to Port Maillot Metro, from which you can easily go anywhere in Paris you care to visit.

**2) CAMPING ON THE SEINE - MAISON-LAFITTE CAMPSITE**  
  
Can you imagine starting your day in Paris by feeding swans swimming in the Seine in your pajamas with bits of your left over warm croissants? This photo was taken in  high season summer and we were camped a few feet from the river, right on the bank of the Seine and had it all to ourselves.  
  
We adored our site right on the banks of the Seine at our popular [Maison-Lafitte campsite](http://www.tripadvisor.ie/Hotel_Review-g187147-d296034-Reviews-Camping_International_de_Maisons_Laffitte-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) and the good access to central Paris via RER.  
[Maisons Laffitte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maisons-Laffitte "maison-Lafitte france") ( "City of Horses") is a sweet little town just 11 miles from the center of Paris with a beautiful, 17th century chateau, a famous horse track and plenty of cafes, restaurants and small supermarkets. One can easily pretend to be living a [Parisian](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/paris-chic-street-style-.html "parisian chic") commuter existence like many of the locals.  
  
[![Touring Paris on holiday](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019102e54a30970c.jpg "Touring Paris on holiday")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019102e54a30970c.jpg)  
  
  
This older, ( refurbished in 2012) but pretty and well maintained campsite is located on an island in the middle of the Seine River, and just ten minutes  away from the center and the train station. It's just 20 minutes to the [center of Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/madeline-linea.html "paris travel with kids") and 50 minutes to Disneyland by train.Next to the train station there is a tourist information office with helpful folks who speak English which is handy.  
  
There are 351 pitches for tents, caravans or campers and 92 fully equipped cottages and the price begins at 15 euro a night for 2 people. There is no pool here, but the municipal pool is only a 15 minutes walk.  
  
For us, it is a toss up between this campground, [Camping International Maisons-Laffitte](http://www.sandaya.fr/web/EN/campings/France/Paris/Maisons-Laffitte/Overview.htm "camping maisons-laffitte") and [Le Camping Bois de Boulogne.](http://www.paris-tourisme.com/campsite/ "camping paris")We like them both a lot and they have different advantages ( and disadvantages). Sadly, they both have bad internet, but we have our own fave [free wifi travel office](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/free-wifi-travel-office-paris-digital-nomad-technomad-minimalist-workshift-mobile-work-on-the-road.html "free wifi paris travel office") in the center near the [Louvre](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/paris-sunset-picnic-at-the-louvre-budget-luxury.html "louvre picnic").  
  
[![Paris boat and Notre Dame](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901ced97a1970b.jpg "Paris boat and Notre Dame")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901ced97a1970b.jpg)

**3) SWIMMING IN A FOREST - CAMPING HUTTOPIA VERSAILLES**  
  
The [campsite in Versailles](http://www.huttopia.com/srt/huttopia/flb/translatabled/show;jsessionid=30D9553CBA2D73380A7CFA63E778529E?location.id:=1617&user.huttopia.lang:=null) ( which we stayed at to visit Versailles and some [visit Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/dramatic-paris.html "Paris holiday") from there using the RER trains) did have excellent cheap wifi, but we did not like that campsite ( primitive, very sloped site) or the very rude young people who ran it. The help was mostly teen boys and more interested in partying than being helpful.  
  
But it does have a small pool, so if it's hot I might return just for that and it is newer and quite nice looking, but the pitches are way too steep and packed together ( no privacy). I did love the foresty feel to it and it was full of mature chestnut trees. The cottages looked good there and the suburban town is nice ,but it is also more expensive than our two favorite campgrounds in Paris.  
  
[![Paris is ideal for kids..sailing a boat in the park](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901cef5b95970b.jpg "Paris is ideal for kids..sailing a boat in the park")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901cef5b95970b.jpg)  
  
  
It is an easy and pleasant ten minute walk to the Porchefontaine RER train station that brings you right into the Eiffel Tower in just 20 minutes. The other way on the train is five minutes to Versailles (or a thirty-five minute walk and Versailles is free to wander the gardens on most days...and it's huge..biking this area would be fun too). Plus there is a  well stocked Carrefour store and a boulangerie to pick up groceries. So this one would work in a pinch.

So what do you think? Is it time to plan a camping trip to Paris?

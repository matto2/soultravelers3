What is the highest train ride in France? The charming [Yellow Train](http://www.countrycousins.co.uk/yelltren.htm "yellow train") in the French Pyrenees or "Le Train Jaune" as they say in French. The Yellow Train is  not just a tourist train, but a regular train that has been running for over 100 years.  
  
The Yellow Train is perfect for family travel to [explore the Pyrenees](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/04/family-travel-france-pyrenees-photo-highest-train-ride.html "explore the pyrenees"). We loved the colorful conductor and these ladies dressed as they would be if they took the train when it began.  
  
When we stayed in [beautiful Colliore](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html "beautiful  Colliore") we did this as a day trip via train and  took this unique Yellow train  from Villefranche de Conflent to the Unesco World Heritage Site, [Mont-Louis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Louis "Mont-Louis") which was built by the famous French architect, [Vauban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauban "Vauban").  
  
Unesco World Heritage Site [Villefranche de Conflent](http://www.villefranchedeconflent.com/index.php?lang=en "villefrache de confllent") is a gorgeous medieval village with charming stone houses and the views are are quite spectacular during the ride in this train with it's bright Catalan colors with some open topped cars. A perfect day trip to escape the heat and enjoy nature, small villages and the charms of yesteryear.

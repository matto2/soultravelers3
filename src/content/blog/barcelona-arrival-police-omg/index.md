We'd read about the police and student protests in Barcelona, but didn't expect to see two policemen on motorcycles coming at us when we arrived after driving eight hours.  
  
Okay, we were [searched by custom police and their dog for drugs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/car-wreck-in-france-dealing-with-disaster-road-trip-nightmare-car-accident-abroad-insurance-problems.html#more "searched for drugs by custom police") in Ireland, pulled over by the police in Germany for going to slow on the autobhan, and scolded for not being [naked in Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/beauty-and-nake.html "naturalist camping Europe"), but we're law abiding boomers and family tourists!  
  
![friendliest policeman in Spain!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e88dd09d7970d.jpg)  
  
Like our [interveiw with the BBC](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "soultravelers3 interview with BBC on social media") in London, this was another rock star arrival! Who would ever guess that an ordinary family like us would have such adventures as we [travel the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel lifestyle")?  
  
When he took off his helmet, we recognized our dear friend who makes the [best paella in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "best paella in spain")! What a fun surprise as [we love this family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "making friends overseas") so much and hurried as fast as we could to see them before they take off to California on June 16th for their vacation.  
  
Mozart was hooting and hollering with delight when we pulled into our favorite [Barcelona Resort Campground](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "barcelona resort camping") and has planned a sleep over in her tent with her best friend here, so was even more happy to see and hug her dad.  
  
![chica rides a policia bike in Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e88dd0e28970d.jpg)  
  
We have never seen him in uniform and it was swell to meet his partner as well who also likes to travel. Mozart thought it was quite the honor to sit on the policia motorcycle and wear the helmut pretending she was the hero of the day!  
  
A great thunderbolt delight after a long arduous drive with a few nerve-wracking mishaps along the way.  
  
![road trip spain beautiful scenery](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301538ee99b35970b.jpg)  
  
The drive from [southern Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html#more "southern spain") to Barcelona took longer than usual because we ran into some car trouble or should I say motorhome trouble. We had it checked before we left, but sometimes things happen, although we mainly are trouble free despite having an older motorhome.  
  
![granada mountains sierra nevada, spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e88dd2239970d.jpg)  
  
Luckily we had no problems in the Sierra Nevada mountains around Granada, but we started hearing some strange squeaking noises close to our scheduled stop the second night near Costa Blanca at our [favorite spa](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/family-travel-photo-spain-thermal-roman-baths-fortuna-spa-camping-hotel-costa-blanca.html "costa blanca spa"). Not a bad way to spend an extra day while the RV was getting fixed, eh? My body enjoyed the extra soaking!  
  
![road trip spain means red poppies in may june](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301538ee9b6dc970b.jpg)  
  
It was scary at first when we didn't know what the problem was or how we would solve it and trust me it is weird to be in a campsite without a tent or RV all day, but it is a beautiful and relaxing place to be and they have a lovely lounge and restaurant so that helped.

![Best friends in Spain and fave dog](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833015432bd07f1970c.jpg)  
  
 All was solved easily at low costs, so we enjoyed the drive and scenery of green mountains, lush fields and red poppies in bloom every where. I hear Barcelona had some rain while we drove, but the sun is back now. Just as we watched the [World Cup](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/world-cup-football-soccer-in-europe-with-friends.html "world cup in barcelona") here, we'll enjoy the game this weekend as we are told Spain plays the USA.  
  
Meanwhile Mozart will be in BFF heaven! Despite webcam calls, she has missed her sweet friend and we have all missed them all. She also loves their dog like no other and took a stuffed version with her ( that they gave her as a birthday present last fall)  all around the world.  
  
Happy weekend all! What are your plans?

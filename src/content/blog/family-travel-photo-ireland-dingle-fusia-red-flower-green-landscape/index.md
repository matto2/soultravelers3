Family travel is enhanced by [time in nature](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/family-travel-photohappy-earth-day.html) and sometimes it's a small thing like a beautiful flower that can touch your heart. We loved these Fuschia's that were all over [Dingle, Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle). Of course we l[oved the traditional music](http://www.dingle-peninsula.ie/tradmusic.html) and have yet to tell you about our exciting musical Pub crawl here or visiting historic Blasket Island, architecture and more in this area where the [Irish language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) (_Gaeilge_ or _Gaelainn_) is widely spoken.

Those stories will come soon, but the abundant large Fuschia bushes intrigued us because we have them at [home](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html) in [California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/timing-is-eve-1.html), but didn't expect to see them growing wild in this climate. They are not native plants, but have thrived. Hmmm, kind of reminds me of [a world traveling family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) that I know!

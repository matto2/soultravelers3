Happy [Earth Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day "earth day")! Do you want to hear a kid's view about saving the planet? Or children singing a beautiful song about a clean earth, compassion and love ( in Mandarin and English) ? Do you care about green,[sustainable living](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_living "sustainable living")? Mozart's very first solo? You've come to the right place.  
  
As some of you know, we have been [wintering in tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "wintering in tropical Asia") so that our 10 year old trilingual child can immerse in her Mandarin. She is the youngest, smallest and [only Caucasian at her Asian Mandarin high school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "only caucasian at Asian Mandarin high school"). While we have been preparing for our upcoming travel to [Singapore](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/03/top-hotel-for-luxury-fairmont-singapore.html "singapore"), Bangkok, Bhutan and Jordan starting on May 1st, on our way to Europe for the summer,  she has been busy working hard and volunteering at her school.  
  
We wrote about her recently [winning first place trophy at her Mandarin high school elocution contest](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/04/chinese-school-trophy-girl-.html "winning first place mandarin high school elocution contest"), and promised to upload a video of it. Saving the earth has become one of Mozart's passions of late and even though the contest speech could be about anything, she chose to talk about saving the planet and working together. She wrote the speech herself and gave it to an audience of over 1000 people. We're very proud of her and thought you'd enjoy the speech too on this [Earth Day](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/family-travel-photohappy-earth-day.html "earth day")!

Mozart loves the big choir at her Madarin high school and all her friends there. They just had a huge celebration for Earth Day at her school this past Sunday with all the students, parents and local dignitaries and Chinese VIP's. Our daughter was very honored to be asked to sing a solo for this occasion, acapella no less, to this large audience to lead the choir in an English and Mandarin song, _A Clean Planet,_ for their performance. She has never had any training in singing, so I thought she was very brave and again we were gushingly proud parents. Hope you enjoy it too!

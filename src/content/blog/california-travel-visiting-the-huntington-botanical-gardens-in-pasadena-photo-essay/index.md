I am sure it is even more exciting today and each day as summer approaches. You will see this huge red sculpture near the entrance to the gardens. It's Alexander Calder's "Jerusalem Stabile," lent to The Huntington by the Calder Foundation in 2015.

The Huntington Botanical Gardens are located in the city of San Marino close to Pasadena. It is a gorgeous educational center serving scholars and the general public.

 This mesmerizing botanical collection is enormous covering 120 acres of the 207-acre grounds and I don't think it's really possible to see it all in one day. There are memorable landscapes from around the world including the exotic Desert Garden ( the oldest, largest succulent collections in the world), Jungle Garden, Bing Children's Garden, Japanese Garden, Chinese, Rose Garden, and more.

It was a great place for Mozart to write some music and since the local college is not far away, it is not unusual to people with books enjoying the lush atmosphere.

 The Conservatory is open to the public on Saturdays. The Huntington Desert Garden is nearly 100 years old  and has grown into a a ten-acre garden.

Huntington and his wife Arabella who  purchased the property in 1903.

D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths  
This is one of Mozart's absolute favorite books!  
It is big, so I debated whether we should bring it or  
not. I am thrilled that we decided to bring it along,  
especially for Greece and Turkey! This is a children's  
classic with great drawings and tales and I know at  
least one gifted school that uses it in their curriculum.  
This makes homeschool very easy for a child with  
passion for this subject. We met a teacher on our  
gulet boat trip in Turkey who said Mozart knew  
more about Greek myths than he did and she  
had learned it all on her own.

Tapestries and a knight in shining  
armor...what could capture the joys  
of family travel in England any better?

Tapestries and a knight in shining armor...what could capture the joys of family travel in England any better? We justÂ  had a fantastic week [in London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/-roomorama-short-term-rentals-usa-london-budget-hotel-apartments-.html#more) from October 1st through 8th, our [second time](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html) there on our [world tour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4) and took a train to the countryside to join friends from around the world for a high tea at the posh [Cliveden House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliveden).

This was part of Mozart's 9th birthday celebration as she has been wanting to go to a fancy high tea for a while and her actual birthday was [affected deeply by my injury in Melk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html). It was still a difficult trip because of my painful and temporarily paralyzed dominant arm and hand, but we made it with lots of assistance.

I will be writing more about our wonderful time there, but couldn't resist sharing this cute picture of Mozart and her latest "little sister" that she met there and played with all day.

I spent my first night in our RV the day we returned to Melk and then said good bye to my sweet physical therapist (who has the same birthday as me!) and surgeon the next day and started the long trek back to southern Spain for the winter.

It is extra challenging because the bed in the RV is very hard and since I can not change positions, the pain wakes me up every few hours and then I have to wake up Davinci several times a night to help reposition me. We haven't managed to get an uninterrupted nights sleep since the accident!

To add to this joy, I just got a cold/flu thing, so I will remain behind in emails etc and the blog as I can only do so much with one left hand! The good news is very slowly, day by day, I heal. We all get stronger by the lessons learned through this struggle.

We are in Vienna now and I have so enjoyed the pool here as a form of therapy that my physical therapist highly recommended and it is so soothing to my arm plus great fun for Mozart. We are heading off to the healing waters in Budapest and then through Slovenia and Italy where we will take a ship to Barcelona, I probably won't be online much until we get there for a little rest at a another great spot with a great indoor pool.

We have mastered [roadschooling,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/pint-sized-pilg.html) so now it seems we are inventing roadtherapy on the go!

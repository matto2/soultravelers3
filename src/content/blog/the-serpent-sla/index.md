The Serpent Slayer and Other Stories  
of Strong Women  
I think all girls should read stories about strong women heroes, so this book is in our traveling library. There is so much one can learn through classic fairy tales and Mozart loves reading these. Great illustrations too by Trina Schart Hyman.

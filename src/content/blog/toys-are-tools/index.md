There were over 43,000 toys there and he has been collecting them since he was a young boy of seven, our Mozart's age. I had read that it is the best museum in Sintra and it certainly was impressive. He actually started the foundation in 1987, but has been in this new building just seven years.  
  
We did a quick, spontaneous interview with him and I loved what he said about toys being tools and helping children make their dreams become reality. It is interesting that his favorite toy was his very first toy that was handed down to him. I loved that picture of him on it when he was a year old and seeing all that he created with his passion for toys.If you are ever in this beautiful area...do not miss it!

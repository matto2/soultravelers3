This sign was taken at the Chew Jetty which is part of the historical Clan jetties in Weld Quay, or floating homes in  a village built on stilts that are  over a century old. They were built by Chinese imigrant clans from the Fukien Province in China and the 1500 decendents still uphold most of the traditional lifestyles and cultures. Fascinating and charming area!

And the Skylark sings with me Adventures in  
Homeschooling and Community-based Education  
I really like this book about a family that homeschools and how much they all learn through the adventure and community-based education. His children had great interest in Opera and music very young like Mozart, so that is what led me to this book. I even got to "know" them online as they were originally from our same town and he is very active in homeschooling circles. Lots of good information here and an attitude that I admire.

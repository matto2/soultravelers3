Europeans are wild about football, or what we Americans call soccer, and it is also a huge sport here in Asia where the Euro 12 is hyped heavily even on our Mandarin TV station. It was pretty thrilling when we got to [watch Spain win the World Cup in Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/watching-spain-win-the-world-cup-in-barcelona-celebrations-fifa-football-fever-europe-travel-resort.html "spain win the world cup in Barcelona"), a memory we will always cherish.  
  
We spend a lot of time in our favorite [Barcelona beach resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html) and all the boys are crazy for football so matches go on constantly from the [kids clubs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "kids clubs ") to adults with male and female teams. Even babies practice!  The most popular kid outfit by far is what Mozart is wearing in this photo..the enormously loved Barca team shirt.  
  
Her [Barcelona best friend](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "Barcelona best friend") had one, so of course she had to have one too. [Our local friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "Our local Spanish friends") told us the cheapest place to buy was at the Barcelona airport, so that is where we got it. Mozart wouldn't take it off so wore it on our flight to Germany and then [on to Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "Florida vacation").  
  
Alas, we [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel the world as a family") VERY light, so we didn't have room to bring it with us to [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang ") ( Mozart had used her Xmas money to buy a few clothes in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "capitola california") at her fave shop), so this treasured souvenir is packed away safely at [Grandma's beach house.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/california-beach-new-years-day.html "Grandma's beach house in California")  
  
 Who are you rooting for?

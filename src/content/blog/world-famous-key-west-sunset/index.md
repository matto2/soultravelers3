One of the many things you don't want to miss when you [visit Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/key-west-vacation.html "visit key west"), Florida is the world famous sunsets in Mallory Square. I first went to [Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/-beach-bliss-romantic-dining-fantasy-in-key-west.html "Key west vacation tip") almost 50 years ago when I was a kid and was happy to return in my twenties to join the crowd at the docks in Mallory Square to celebrate the beautiful sunsets and applaud the setting sun.  
  
What a treat it was recenly to share this now famous ritual with my daughter on our [Florida roadtrip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "Florida road trip"),Â  so her memory banks can also be filled with this pleasure. Mallory Square and the celebration has grown a lot since my childhood, but the [sweetness of the setting sun](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/beautiful-sunset-in-pensacola-florida.html "sunset florida") over the sea remains the same.  
  
Just looking at it makes me hear refrains from a Jimmy Buffet song and relax into the laid back tropical island mindset ( a bit easy to do as we are now living near the sea on a tropical island). It makes my mouth water for the [famous Key West pink shrimp](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/famous-key-west-pink-shrimp.html "famous key west pink shrimp").  
  
Have you been to the famous Key West sunset?

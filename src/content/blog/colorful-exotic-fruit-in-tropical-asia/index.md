Do you enjoy exotic fruits? [Tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical Asia") is the place to explore them as there are so many strange fruits that I have never even seen before. One way to combine [healthy food and travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "healthy food and travel") is to eat like the locals and find ways to eat [organic raw food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic raw food"). This is where we [buy organic food in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/where-to-buy-organic-food-in-penang.html "where to buy organic food in Penang").

We don't eat everything like the locals and stick to favorites that we know from home like papayas, mangos, bananas and pineapples, but sometimes we get adventurous.

I have forgotten what the name of these odd, harry ones are, but they are quite yummy and taste something like a kumquat. Hubs, who found it at the market, says it's a rambutan.

My daughter is crazy about the passion fruit and regularly makes her own [healthy soda pop](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-soda-pop-even-a-kid-can-do-it-.html "healthy soda pop") using them. We do lots of things with the cheap coconut here, including [making healthy, cheap deodorant](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-diy-homemade-deodorant-easy-cheap-healthy.html "making healthy, cheap deodorant").

Sometimes I think I enjoy these fruits as much for their looks as the taste, as my fruit bowls and fruit platters make me smile and remind me I am doing a sensual, tropical winter life again this year.

This is some kind of coconut concoction, and we haven't tried it yet, but it looks intriquing dressed in those leaves which I am guessing are banana tree leaves all nestled on a [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin ") paper.

We had to ask a local how to eat these things... the good stuff is a gooey thing in the middle.

Okay the organic tomatoes above and avocodos here are not tropical fruits, but we mix a little bit of everything in. We even occasionally have organic apples, but they are imported, so expensive, thus we don't get them too often.  
  
Thus,Â  that is my little photo essay on tropical fruit. We've had more, but I don't always get a photo of each thing we try. The popular ( and smelly) durian is not my thing and some look too strange to eat regularly.  
  
What is your favorite exotic fruit?

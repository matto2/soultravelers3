Have you been face to face with an [elephant seal](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1115 "elephant seal")? Field trips provide opportunity for direct study of the environment and are one of the most fun ways to learn while [being out in nature](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/beautiful-butterfly-flowers-and-family-travel.html "being out in nature"). We are blessed that [our world traveling lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "our world traveling lifestyle") over the last 6 years makes our life one big [world school field trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "one big world school field trip") of this planet, but we took advantage of our [time in California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "visiting California") to focus on many science based field trips.  
  
We've actually been to [Ano Nuevo State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=523 "Ano Nuevo state park") many times over the years, but felt it was time to redo it as visiting it at five is quite different than visiting it at eleven. [Our travel school method](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/travel-schooling-learning-through-travel.html "how to travel school") is to do repeat visits to places that we love. [Ano Nuevo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%B1o_Nuevo_State_Park "ano nuevo") is fascinating and the world's largest mainland breeding site of [elephant seals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_seal "elephant seals"), an endangered species.  
  
We had perfect weather, a wonderful tour guide and there were a ton of elephant seals to observe along with native plants and other animals. I will be writing more about this visit and other science field trips, but just thought I'd give you a peek of these cute babies!

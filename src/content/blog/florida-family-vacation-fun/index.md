When you are tired of the rain, cold and snow on the East Coast or Midwest, there is nothing quite like hitting the [sunshine and beautiful beaches of Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "sunshine and beautiful beaches")! Some of my happiest childhood memories were about leaving the snow behind in Michigan on a wintery day and waking up to bright sun and warm breezes on my face.  
  
My Dad drove all night long and we would pitch a tent right on the stunning snow-colored sandy beaches of Pensacola. A very frugal, but thrilling journey for a family of six, that we usually did a couple of times a winter. We'd return, with big smiles, winter tans and totally relaxed.  
  
On our recent [road trip to Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "road trip to Florida"), we re-lived some of that bliss. Sometimes, it's the simple moments of fun, sun and togetherness that makes for the happiest family vacation memories. Like building a sand castle together as the sun sets and the tide rolls in.  
  
What are your happiest family memories? Did you ever escape the snow for some holiday sunshine?

Major Improvements

Do you know what your [vitamin D level](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/sun-for-its-health-benefits-.html "sun and vitamin D level - how to increase") is? Did you know it is critical in heart disease, cancer, diabetes, MS, osteoporosis, asthma, Crohns, pneumonia, parkinsons, influenza, depression, acne, dental cavities and periodontal disease, autism, autoimmune problems, pain, dementia and  more?  I think it is astonishing that vitamin D affects over 2700 genes –around 10% of the human genome and every cell and organ in your body!  
  
"Abnormal levels of vitamin D are associated with a whole spectrum of diseases, including cancer, osteoporosis, and diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders." Dr. Richard Kremer  
  
**VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY - A SILENT EPIDEMIC**  
  
A study published in the March, 2010 issue of the _Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism_ found that **59 percent of the population is vitamin D deficient** and 92% of northern Europeans were found extremely [deficient in Vitamin D.](http://www.vitamindwiki.com/Many+reasons+why+vitamin+D+deficiency+has+become+epidemic "vitamin D deficiency")  
  
Yet most people don't know what their vitamin D level is and since I spend most of my time in sunny, summer climates and always have a tan, I like most people never imagined that I had an extremely low vitamin D level which contributed greatly to my [health issues](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health secrets").  
  
[![getting vitamin D from sun](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192aa7fea26970d.jpg "getting vitamin D from sun")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192aa7fea26970d.jpg)  
  
**DON'T TRUST YOUR MD ABOUT VITAMIN D AS MOST ARE UNINFORMED**  
  
Worse yet, most doctors ( M.D.'s) are clueless about how important vitamin D is as it is not part of their training ( other than how it affects kidney dialysis). Also the sun is **FREE** and the best way to raise one's vitamin D levels, so it won't make them any money.  
  
**NOT ONE OF THE TOP M.D. DOCTORS SAID ANYTHING ABOUT MY EXTREMELY LOW VITAMIN D LEVELS.**  
  
Luckily at least one of them gave me that blood test amongst my endless tests, but not he, nor **ANY** one of the many who have looked at all my test results seem to notice my vitamin D deficiency was at **ALARMING LEVELS.** ( One study  showed that people with vitamin D levels less than 15 ng/ml (37 nmol/l) were over 2 times more likely to have a heart attack when compared to those with vitamin D levels above 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l)... to give you an idea of the danger).  
  
" Your vitamin D level should not be below 32 ng/ml, and any levels below 20 ng/ml are considered serious deficiency states, increasing your risk of cancer and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, just to name a few." Dr. Mercola  
  
Thankfully, I figured that out on my own through extensive research and I will link to some of the best books that can help you resarch as well. In December 2012 my vitamin D level was 18 ng/ml...lower than many stage IV cancer patients with extremely low vitamin D level case studies I read about. UGH!  
  
**BE SMART GET YOUR VITAMIN D CHECKED REGULARLY**  
  
Despite my taking a very high rated whole food multivitamin [for seniors](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retirement and travel") daily, eating well, walking daily in sunny climates so that I have a permanent tan line on my berkie sandals etc, it could have been that dangerously low for a decade and killed me. I also found out [my mother](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/worlds-best-mot.html "mother") ( who golfs regularly in sunny [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "California destinations for travel")) and my sister ( who walks in the sun regularly on her lunch break in sunny California are also deficient in Vitamin D as was my cousin who lives in [San Francisco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/san-francisco-travel-why-we-love-it.html "San Francisco travel") area.

Dr. Zaidi a leading endocrinologist MD who worked for many years with patients in San Diego, (who usually spent time outdoors daily, took vitamins and lived a healthy lifestyle) said that almost all of his patients from children to the elderly had vitamin D deficiencies. He is one of the few smart doctors who tests for vitamin D, is aware what optimal levels are needed and has had great success treating patients with vitamin D for Cancer, Diabetes, Osteoporosis etc. The only patient that he saw that had good, optimal levels above 50 ng/ml from the sun, was a young woman who was a life guard.  
  
**I AM LIVING PROOF THAT ONE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE YOUR VITAMIN D LEVELS TO OPTIMAL JUST BY USING FREE SUN, EVEN OVER 60 AND OVERWEIGHT!!**  
  
I recently had my vitamin D level checked by an M.D. here to see if my vitamin D through sun (ala [Dr. Mercola](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/03/26/maximizing-vitamin-d-exposure.aspx "dr mercola and sun for vitamin d") and other experts protocols) was working. I was happy to see that I had raised my vistamin D level to 56ng/ml. which most consider to be an optimal level ( unless one has health issues or are overweight, in which case most suggest to go higher).  
  
( I have also improved greatly in all my blood work including cholesterol due to our [healthy diet](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy diet and travel") including our latest [cavity prevention](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "curiing and preventing cavities and gum disease"), no grains and lots of [coconut](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconut superfood") oil, good fats and [raw milk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/raw-milk-fast-and-cure.html "raw milk fast and cure") [kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "coconut milk kefir").  I've met the most brilliant Clinical Nutritionist ( double Master Degrees from Columbia University) [Kasia Przechodzka](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kasia-przechodzka-ms-cscs/b/854/93b "kasia przechodzka brilliant clinical nutritionist") ( in the New York City area) who is helping me and has been the best person so far to give me accurate information on my blood work ( way better than all the top M.D.'s that I have consulted who were basically useless, but then they have NO TRAINING in nutrition sadly).More on that in an upcoming post.)

Getting vitamin D from the sun is  best because when you expose your skin to sunshine , your skin synthesizes vitamin D3 SULFATE. This form of vitamin D is water soluble, unlike oral vitamin D3 supplements, which are unsulfated and fat soluble. The water soluble form can travel freely in your blood stream, whereas the unsulfated form needs LDL as a vehicle of transport. Thus oral non-sulfated form of vitamin D likely will not provide the same benefits as the vitamin D created in your skin from sun  exposure, because it cannot be converted to vitamin D sulfate. Vitamin D made from the sun actually lasts longer in the body, compared with vitamin D from supplements or foods.  
  
The SUN is exactly how I got my Vt D from 18 up to 56  now (good diet as well with high Vt D /k2/ mineral foods). So the good news is despite me being fat and old...I still make some Vt D pretty good on my own using sun here. I am lucky to be right on the equator ( despite the sun here, Malaysia has 74% of it's population with less than 20ng of Vitamin D likely due to covered clothing), and usually spend 10 to 20 minutes at high noon with most of my body exposed about once a week ( sometimes 2 or 3 times a week and some weeks missed).

Like most things, there are differing opinions about vitamin D, so it's best to do your own research and I am just sharing what has worked for me and my family. Your mileage may vary. Vitamin D, A, K, E and things like Calcium, Magnesium, Boron etc all work together synergistically, so LOTS to learn on this topic that I can't cover in one blog post.  
  
The more you know about vitamin D and how to keep yours and your famiies at the optimal level, the better off you will be in my opinion. It is a simple cure that could save so many. I wish I had paid more attention to this earlier, but glad I at least found out all the details now. Any questions?

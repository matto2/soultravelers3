The [best way to see Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "best way to see Europe"), the [best way to experience the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "best way to experience the world"), is always slow travel.Want to avoid the typical post-vacation burnout and returning from a holiday or vacation more exhausted than when you left?

Think slow! It not only [prevents travel burn out](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/how-to-prevent-travel-burnout.html "prevents travel burn out"), but it will greatly enhance your experience. Less is more. [Camping in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "camping in Europe") makes this easy and one of our favorite ways for our [global mobile lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "global mobile lifestyle"), but [renting furnished apartments in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "renting furnished apartments in Europe") or [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Asia rental apartments for vacations") also works well.

Not everyone can go as slow as we do [our world travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "our world travel"), but by planting yourself in one location for at least a week and doing less ( instead of trying to do a whole country in a week or running around like mad and seeing little due to speed) you will experience more culture and enjoy yourself more.

Think deep instead of wide and know taking time to relax and absorb the new experiences will benefit you and your vacation. Not to mention that it will also save you a LOT of money and connect you with local folks.

Even when you have a limited time frame, it's important to schedule in time to rest, recover and reflect about all that you are seeing and experiencing. Due to short time restictions when we [traveled with extended family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "traveling with extended family"), like doing [multigenerational travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/family-arrives.html "multigenerational travel"), I created an itinerary that allowed us to [see a lot of Spain in 10 days](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/02/marbella.html "see a lot of spain in 10 days"), but also made sure we had relaxing hang out days in between more intense touring days. We try to always rest after a touring day as lazy days refresh and kids need pool, beach and free play time to stay happy travelers.

This summer we've really enjoyed our slow travel in Europe. After our faster trips to [Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "Bhutan") and [Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "jordan"), we were happy to slow it down in [Madrid](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/taste-of-madrid.html "Madrid"), [Andalusia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "Andalusia"), [Costa Blanca](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/family-travel-photo-spain-thermal-roman-baths-fortuna-spa-camping-hotel-costa-blanca.html "costa blanca"), Andorra and [Barcelona at the beach](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/barcelona-arrival-police-omg.html "barcelona at the beach"). Part of this was due to spontaneously planned [travel with friends](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/international-kids-water-fun-european-style.html "travel with friends") and also my [travel health](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health") concerns.

It's was one of the most relaxing summers ever and we are grateful for that and the wonderful times we had with new and old friends. It was fantastic for our child as well, who got to connect deeply again with friends she has known in Spain for 5 years, reconnecting with Swedish "travel cousins",Â  as well as meeting new friends.  
  
Slow travel allows one to connect to people like no other kind of travel. Most of the kids in these photos we spent several weeks to several months with, so enriched our family travel immensely. Connecting to people from other lands is one of the great advantages of travel, not to mention the [language immersion perks for our trilingual kiddo](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "language immersion perks for kids"). This is one positive way we handle the [homeschool and socialization issue](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "homeschool and socialization issue") and give our child [friend consistency as we travel the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "friend consistency as we travel the world") as [luxury camping in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "luxury camping in Europe") is a fantastic environment that allows her much freedom and autonomy in a safe way.

Are you carving a pumpkin this weekend? Traditions make holidays fun and it's quite amazing how the [traditons about Halloween](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/halloween-around-the-world.html "Halloween around the world") seem to keep spreading around the world. We've seen it in [Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/happy-halloween-traveling-around-the-world-celebrations-for-kids.html "bora bora"), [Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/ahhhumbria.html "itay umbria travel") and now in [Southeast Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "south east Asia winter vacation"). This is a holiday weekend in Malaysia ( [Eid al-Adha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha "eid al adha") or Hari Raya Haji ) but even here there was a [pumpkin carving contest](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/10/27/nation/12233987&sec=nation "pumpkin carving contest") at one of the local malls.

This photo is the pumkin DaVinci and Mozart carved last year at our [special Halloween](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/enchanting-halloween-california-style-1.html "special halloween") in [California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California beach town capitola").Â  This year our minds are more on finals, singing contests and heading out to China soon, but we'll find some way to celebrate.  
  
What are you doing to celebrate Halloween?

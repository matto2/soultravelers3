Do you love thermal healing water to  
soak in? Our world traveling family has  
been "into" them since long before

Do you love thermal healing water to soak in? Our world traveling family has been into them since long before our child was born, taking regular trips to our beloved [Esalen](http://www.esalen.org/) in [Big Sur](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNrDSxJ6h7I&feature=related) as well as [Harper Hot Springs](http://www.harbin.org/) north of San Francisco. Mozart started swimming in our Jacuzzi at four days old, so she took to it all like the proverbial duck to water. When ever we can, we [enjoy finding](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/lalla-mira-hamm.html) good [soaks](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/pamukkale-and-h.html#more) on our [world travels](http://twitpic.com/25xg8)!

After an eight hour drive from [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html) south to the Costa Blanca, we headed inland a bit, to a very special gem that few people know about outside of this region. Yet it has been a [thermal water oasis](http://www.leana.es/) of healing since [Roman times](http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/264200,mud-and-thermal-springs-on-spains-costa-calida.html).

We stayed at a unique campground called [La Fuente](http://www.campingfuente.com/) that has a private shower and bathroom house for each motor home plus every amenity. We see lots from Germany, Finland, Great Britain and Spain, etc, but as usual, we are the only Americans. The wifi is not great here, but they have it and it's a wonderfully charming place that also has cottages, small hotel, restaurants and massages. Perfect relaxation and rejuvenation in the middle of no where!

It is mostly retirees in the winter high season week days, but Mozart lucked out finding a cute little English girl named Emily who has lived in Spain nearby for the last four years. They were the same age, had the same colored hair and same colored eyes, both have a cousin named Debbie and an aunt named Julie, so they decided that they must be twins! What also seemed quite coincidental is that she  had been here when we came in June, even though she also rarely comes, thus this was their second swim date!

They had a ball and DaVinci and I really enjoyed trying out all the contraptions that bubble you to smitherines, spurt pulsating water on acupuncture points and waterfall drip you to heaven. This is just what the doctor ordered for [my injured arm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html) that is recovering very slowly due to the nerve damage.

Long ago when I did a 6 month camping trip from Boston to San Francisco, we met some locals that showed us (via horse) some natural hot springs near [Big Bend National Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_National_Park) & after wards we swam in the cold Rio Grande. That was so much fun that I think that's when I got hooked. Have you found any good soaking spots on your travels?

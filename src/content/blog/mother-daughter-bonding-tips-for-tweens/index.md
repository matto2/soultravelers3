There is a sacred bond between mother and daughter that is like nothing else. As a woman who was lucky enough to have a [wonderful mother](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/02/worlds-best-mot.html "wonderful mother") ( and [traveling Grandma](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "travel with Grandma")) and waited a very long time to have a daughter, I am so grateful for [our world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "Our RTW world trip") these last seven years and the gift of time together that it has given us.  
  
  
A mother's treasure is her daughter.  ~Catherine Pulsifer  
  
A mother's love for her child is like nothing else in the world. It knows no  law, no pity, it dares all things and crushes down remorselessly all that stands in its path." Agatha Christie  
  
"Who fed me from her gentle breast and hushed me in her arms to rest, And on my cheek sweet kisses prest? My Mother."  Anne Taylor  
  
  
It's not aways the big things that matter, but more than anything, I feel like the daily time together is the biggest key on staying close and attached through the tween and teen age years. Things change fast at this age, just a few months ago a [simple pleasure](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/lifes-simple-pleasures.html "simple pleasures") for us was me braiding her hair daily for school, but for quite a bit now, she has learned to do it herself.  
  
One of the things I love about Asia, is it's cool to walk hand in hand around [the mall](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/tropical-christmas-abroad-in-asia.html "Asia mall Christmas") with your mom, even if you are a teen or tween! Mozart's always been a Mama's girl, but she also has a fantastic [bond with her father.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/happy-fathers-day-traveling-dads.html "father daughter bond")

**FINDING TIME IN A BUSY WORLD**  
  
In todays busy world, it can be hard to carve out that time, especially with school, work and extra curricular things. We mostly [homeschool with our trave](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschool and travel")l, but sometimes we dip into schools as we are now in [Penang for her Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Penang for Mandarin") immersion. Last semester we made a switch in her [Chinese school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "Chinese school"), so much extra study for her [Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "American in Mandarin school"), that it was challenging to find that daily time, but we did.  
  
Thankfully, this semester we have a lot more free time and soon she will be on a two month vacation, so we will have more time to travel and just hang out together. We had a giggly, talkative long bonding session this past weekend, when she asked me to cover her hair in tiny braids, so we work on this project together. I knew it was a memory in the making.  
  
**MY 5 BEST TIPS FOR MOTHER-DAUGHTER BONDING**  
  
SPEND QUALITY **AND** QUANTITY TIME TOGETHER  
  
Childhood zips by fast, each day and moment you lose in busy-ness, you will never have again. [Unplug](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "Unplug your life") and if you travel, do [slow travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel"). Look for ways to simplify and slow your life down, be more present in the now, do less.  
  
ATTACHMENT PARENTING BEGINS IN THE WOMB AND NEVER ENDS  
  
That doesn't mean you don't support freedom and independence in your child, but you demonstrate the value of loving, attachment, kindness and relationship that will support them forever.  
  
LISTEN TO YOUR CHILD AND GIVE THEM  YOUR FULL ATTENTION  
  
Have sacred times like when they go to sleep and first wake up where the whole family can relax and talk intimately. It's a bonding ritual we all love. We do this too at every meal and after school when she is on a school schedule to reconnect and learn about each others day when apart. We enjoy cuddling together and reading books too - skin to skin touch is a type of attention and "being there", sharing passages we enjoy.  
  
PLAY AND PRAY TOGETHER EVERY DAY  
  
Being playful is as important in our family as prayer, since our God is a joyful one, so we encouage laughter, dancing, creativity and see them as a form of prayer and gratitude.  We are a family who believes in the power of prayer, so "But as for _me and my house_, _we_ will _serve the LORD_" is our foundation and heart compass. I've been meditating daily for over 30 years, so pass that on to her.  
  
EXPRESS YOUR LOVE OFTEN IN WORDS AND DEEDS  
  
In this world, we all need more love, forgiveness , acceptance and tenderness. When my brother died young and suddenly, I was reminded about how important telling someone often how much you love and appreciate them and demonstrating it in many ways is. I was at peace with his passing because I had done that, but it reminded me that we never know when our last moment together will be, so make the most of the ones we have.

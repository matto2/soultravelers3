Mostly countries that were traveled very deeply, mostly by foot and in 3 fluent languages ( Chinese, Spanish, English), which is an extremely rare feat for a young American girl (daughter of monolingual parents) just finishing her primary school years.

**RECORD AMOUNT OF UNESCO SITES, MUSEUMS, ANCIENT RUINS FOR TRAVELING KID**  
  
Mozart probably has the record for the most UNESCO World Heritage sites on 5 continents, world-class museums or ancient ruins seen by a kid. She's gone completely around the world more than once, visited many national parks across the USA to earn Junior Ranger Badges, worked with archeologists and marine biologists on several continents and I gave up adding up our travel miles once it passed 200,000 many, many years ago.

**KID WITH TIME TO TRAVEL WORLD SLOWLY AND TV SHOW TALKS**  
  
In our discussions about her travel show (producers, directors, entertainment lawyers, publicists, managers etc. have recently come to us about this), we have suddenly realized that she is probably the most traveled child in the world her age! We'd never thought about it before.  
  
Since we [retired early to travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/retire-and-travel-the-world.html "retire and travel the world") and educate her (via [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool high school and travel") or [worldschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school best education")) she has had more time and freedom to become a global citizen than anyone I have ever met or read about.

Mozart made this video a month after she turned 10 when we were couchsurfing in Bora Bora..just taping herself on the ipod spontaneously and we've added our photos. It gives a great peek into a kids view of our ordinary and extraordinary lifestyle with the world as our classroom.  
  
  
**FAMILY WORLD TRAVEL - RTW WAY OF LIFE OR VACATION?**  
  
We are pioneers in the around-the-world digital nomad, permanent-vacation blogging realm...started that trend before most single and couple travelers, let alone families (when we sold our home and all belongings in 2005, plus were asked to be case studies in Mega hit books [4Hour Workweek](http://www.timferriss.com/index.html "time ferriss") and [Art of Noncomformity](http://chrisguillebeau.com/the-book/ "art of nonconformity")). Most families that travel around the world, do it for a year on a huge budget, but the world is big and a year can only take you so far (and why we [advise longer and cheaper RTW](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/-around-the-world-travel-best-advice.html "around the world travel best advice")).

**WHO HAS WELL-TRAVELED KIDS?**  
  
Yes, diplomat kids, army brats, travel writers, missionaries, expats, a handful of sailors etc. all travel a lot with kids, but most work (so travel is limited to vacation time) and they don't make their primary goal educating their child via travel, nor have they traveled non-stop for 8 years. We didn't set out to make her the world's most traveled child...it is just something that happened along the way and continues because we love it.

**NYC PUBLICISTS VIEW OF SOULTRAVELERS3, 12 YEAR OLD MOZART AND TRAVEL TV SHOW**  
  
"I am always so inspired by your blog and the life you have set up  
for Mozart. It's mind blowing. I am a publicist in NY and although I  
have no idea what kind of TV you are working on, my gut feeling is  
that she is perfect for a Discovery Kids Travel Show. She could teach  
the world so much - even adults! Her knack for singing and acting  
would flourish naturally and the build up of her profile will open  
doors. Same way Selena Gomez started. That show just gave her a reason  
for people to listen to her sing. Do you guys have an agent? I'll see  
if I can help in anyway. I think she is a natural fit for TV and could  
help change the game for kids TV."  
  
This is the kind of reaction we have been getting lately, which has been deeply touching and is affecting our perspective, opening our eyes to greater possibilities, as we are just an ordinary family following our hearts and doing what we can to support our child. It reminds us of when the [New York Times featured](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html "new york times soultravelers3") us ( when I had my [paralyzed arm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "travel disaster")) or [BBC TV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "soultravelers3 bbc tv"). We always pray and meditate daily and try to discern where our Inner Guidance is leading us.  
  
[![The world's most traveled child knows the journey always begins within](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019affb02c73970b.jpg "The world's most traveled child knows the journey always begins within")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019affb02c73970b.jpg)  
  
**INSPIRING KIDS - THE NEXT GENERATION**  
  
We are not sure where it is leading, but will take it a step at a time, as we discover, along with you. How ever it unfolds, we know it will be more lifelong learning for us and a path full of love and adventure as that is how we do life, no matter what comes our way. We are humbled that we have been able to inspire so many people in many ways just by sharing our story and travels, so it is exciting to have the possibility of reaching even more people...especially children and the next generation.  
  
Carry a vision of heaven in your hearts, and you shall make your home, your school, your world correspond to that vision. ~ Helen Keller

**CHANGING THE WORLD - ONE KID AT A TIME - IN FUN WAYS**  
  
Mozart's passions are the environment, world peace, music, art, math, science and travel, so it will be rewarding to share that more with the world. She is excited to be  scheduled to be a speaker/presenter in November at the world-wide Global Education Conference and plans to do more public speaking sharing her views and experiences to help and inspire others.

**WELL-TRAVELED DOESN'T ONLY MEAN HOW MANY COUNTRIES TO US**  
  
Mozart has been traveling since she was two weeks old and stayed in her first hotel then, but until we went location independent and sold our home and all our belongings in 2005, we just traveled on vacation like most folks. Our purpose has not been to add countries, but explore deeply for educational purposes and [slow trave](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel")l for language learning.  
  

<iframe frameborder="0" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L1AspeNfcGE?rel=0" width="640"></iframe>

  
  
I know a well known travel blogger who spent a week in Italy to add 3 countries to his "country list" by quick stops in San Marino and Vatican City. Which is great, but just not our purpose. Because we traveled Europe 7 months out of the year for many years while on the continent, we've been to Italy many times over the years, often months at a time, but still haven't added those extra "countries" there because spending time in Verona, Cinque Terra, Pompeii, Tuscany, seeing Pinocchio,  Stradavarius, Uffizi or DaVinci museums etc., were just more important than adding countries for us.

**REAL WORLD, REAL TRAVEL, REAL FRIENDS, REAL EDUCATION, REAL FAMILY TIME**  
  
With a child, we are most interested in depth and breath for education and time together, so we put down roots in our [ultimate family travel adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate family travel adventure"), by making many places home where we return often. Having deep friendships around the world and knowing every day things like how to shop at the markets in local currencies or dipping into local schools (in 4 countries) for language learning, gives Mozart the real reason for her most well-traveled status, not just the countries or continents visited. The gift of TIME.

**PROFOUNDLY BLESSED AND ENRICHED BY TRAVELING OUR BEAUTIFUL PLANET**  
  
Many of these countries have been deeply and thoroughly explored repeatedly over many years because seeing Paris at 5 is a very different experience than also seeing it at 10 and 13. We've not only traveled more than most Americans, but also have seen more of Europe than most Europeans and more of Asia than most Asians. There is hardly a book Mozart reads or film she sees that she doesn't have first hand experience with the places mentioned.  
  
[![World's most traveled kid is a trilingual book worm](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019affb12ebc970b.jpg "World's most traveled kid is a trilingual book worm")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019affb12ebc970b.jpg)  
  
I was amazed that even in Mozart's 4th grade class in Spain (which is an easy trip to Venice), she was the only one who knew what a gondola was, had been on one and been to Venice. We realize how very blessed we are to have seen so much of the world together and truly wish every family and child could too. As much as we've seen, there is always more to explore.  
  
**ENTREPRENEUR OPPORTUNITIES AND TEACHING LANGUAGES**  
  
Her 3 languages have also helped her become an entrepreneur at 12, [teaching people languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/best-classes-or-tutor-for-spanish-english-or-mandarin-in-penang.html "teaching people languages") ( from 4 to 30 years old, including a geophysicist) in person and on Sype over 3 continents with rave reviews due to her enthusiasm and experience.

**OUR CURRENT WORLD TRAVEL PLANS**  
  
Our ultra mobile, flexible and minimalist lifestyle means we can change almost instantly to what ever works, as the world is our home and we can liv e any where. Mozart is now at a 5th grade level of reading and writing Mandarin, so has almost completed her goal of Mandarin fluency and finishing the entire Primary school curriculum, so that means we will be more on the move soon.

**DIVING, ELEPHANTS, TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY ADVENTURES**  
  
At the moment, we have tentative short trips planned to Oz, Bali. Maldives diving, elephant riding in Thailand etc.  as well as India,Vietnam, Cambodia, Taiwan, Mongolia. Then, in late spring,  the Trans-Siberian railway trip from Beijing to Paris ( with stops in St Petes and Moscow).Followed by settling back in Provence with our RV,  ( after time with friends in Spain) so Mozart can study French next.  
  
BUT  these  are all just ideas at this point and easily changeable. Our dreams and possibilities never end, but we stay open and flexible, listening to the inner call and direction. This week we book our flights to Oz, so stay tuned!

**YOUNGEST AMERICAN TO VISIT EVERY COUNTRY  IS 34 YEARS OLD!**  
  
We've just discovered that the youngest American to visit every country ( list of [193 United Nations member states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_member_states)) is almost 35 and was 32 in 2011 when he set that record. That seems like a pretty easy record to break for Mozart, but we don't really know if that is something we will choose to do or not. Never really thought about this stuff before and not sure if it is aligned with our purpose.  
  
What do you think about all of this?

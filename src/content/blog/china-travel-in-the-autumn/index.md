Most say that the fall and spring are the best times to [visit China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html#more "visit china") because the weather is good and there are less crowds. November is also suppose to be one of the lowest pollution months in [Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/yum-loving-the-food-in-beijing.html#more "visiting Beijing").  
  
This is our first [visit to China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/getting-a-tourism-visa-for-china-adventure.html#more "visit to China"), so I have no other reference point, but so far we have not had to deal with large crowds any where. The weather has been mostly sunny, clear and crisp...perfect invigorating autumn weather which makes touring easy.  
  
I love this photo of this dragon boat at the Summer Palace that seems to be dressed in fall colors. This lovely park-like area was quite empty when we visited and had a very relaxed atmosphere that was so very Asian in it's tranquility.  
  
When is your favorite time to travel? Have you been captivated by the mysteries of China?

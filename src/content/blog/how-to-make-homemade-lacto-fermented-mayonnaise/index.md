Do you know what the secret is to making super healthy, delicious, easy, fermented mayonnaise? Start with the most nutritious [raw eggs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raw-eggs-healthy-or-not.html "raw eggs"). Of all the fermented foods I make like [kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "kefir how to make goatsmilk and coconut kefir"), kefir [goat cheese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/how-to-make-diy-goat-cheese-with-kefir.html "how to make goat cheese with kefir"), [salsa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-salsa.html "how to make fermented salsa"), [chutney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-mango-papaya-chutney.html "chutney fermented") and more, this mayo is a HUGE hit with the family.  
  
The other big secret is just making sure all the ingredients are at room temperature, then make sure you add the oil slowly. It took me a couple times to get this right, but it is soooo good and soooo healthy, it is worth the effort. I tweaked various recipes and made up a bit of my own, until I made it fool proof.  
  
Most of the recipies for homemade mayo call for olive oil, but we hated the taste of that as you can't find the mild flavored kind in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/where-to-buy-organic-food-in-penang.html "organic food in Penang and Asia") where I am. No one mentions Flax oil, but it's super healthy and works great combined with coconut oil.

**WHAT YOU NEED:**  
  
2 pastured organic eggs at room temperature  
1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar  
1 tsp Whey  
1 tsp lemon juice  
1/2 cup organic virgin cold pressed coconut oil  
1/2 cup organic cold pressed flax oil  
1 tablespoon extra virgin organic olive oil ( optional)  
1/2  tsp mustard  
celtic sea salt, raw unheated honey, crushed garlic, and paprika to taste  
  
[![YUM! Delicious lacto-fermented mayo](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d412619cd970c.jpg "YUM! Delicious lacto-fermented mayo")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d412619cd970c.jpg)  
  
  
**LACTOFERMENTED MAYO RECIPE:**  
  
Put one egg and one yolk in blender at room temperature ( can use 3 yolks too)  
  
Beat well for 1 minute  
  
Add whey, AVC, lemon juice and mix a little more ( room temperature works best)  
  
SLOWLY add the oil as you keep mixing with the blender ( room temperature for oil too)  
  
Add salt, mustard, raw unheated honey, crushed garlic,and paprika to taste ( all optional)  
  
Put in a jar and leave out for a few hours, ( optional)  then refrigerate  
  
This recipe will be more yellow than store bought mayo because the pastured eggs tend to have VERY orange yolks and the Flax oil is also very yellow.

**QUICK FIX IF DIY MAYO IS TOO RUNNY**  
  
If you don't beat the egg or egg yolks well, or add the oil too fast, the mayo can come out runny because it does not emulsify. You can redo it all, by adding another room temp egg yolk or two and then just slowly adding your runny mixture.  
  
BUT I find that I don't even bother now if it is not perfect. I just put it in the fridge and because it has a lot of coconut oil, that firms things up and gives a good texture for our needs...thus I call it fool proof.  
  
This is super delicious, easy and quick to make, and cherished by our family because it also allows us foods that we have been missing like egg salad and chicken salad.  
  
**WHY MAKE YOUR OWN MAYO NOT STORE-BOUGHT?**  
  
Most mayonaise ( even organic) that one buys from the store is full of bad vegetable oils like canola or soy, which have high omega-6 to omega-3 ratios and the heat used to make these fragile polyunsaturated fats during the extraction process and the GMO's  make it a ["frankenfood"](http://wellnessmama.com/2193/why-you-should-never-eat-vegetable-oil-or-margarine/ "why vegetable oils are so bad for you") that the body can not digest.  
  
BUT when you make your own mayo with REAL food, one gets easy to digest, tasty and healthy vitamin D and A, lots of minerals, natural probiotics and antioxidants! We had to live without mayo until we discovered how to make our own. If you don't use the whey, this will last a week, but if you do make it fermented with the whey it lasts several weeks.  
  
  

most store-bought mayonnaises are prepared using vegetable oils which have a high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and whose fragile polyusaturated fatty acids do not stand up well to the modern high-heat extraction process required to make them. For this reason, it’s wise make your own – a

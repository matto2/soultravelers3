Exotic [Andalusia Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/malaga-marbella.html)'s famous [Costa del Sol](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/best-beach-restaurants-on-costa-del-sol-puerto-marina-.html) with it's rich history, [ancient ruins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcazaba_%28M%C3%A1laga%29), [fascinating culture](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html) and [traditions](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/joys-of-the-roa.html) is a perfect [European vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) spot for the whole family, including [kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/flamenco.html#more). As I told the [Frugal Traveler](http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/qa-with-jeanne-dee-the-nomadic-family-traveler/) in the [New York Times](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html), "Spain is great for families". Over 60 million people visit this area every year and many, like us, are return visitors. It has the best winter weather in Europe and is over hundred miles long, filled with [sandy beaches](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/yummy-beach-lun.html), rolling hills and  majestic mountains.

After spending the last four winters in Spain in a [small village on the far eastern part of the Costa Del Sol,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html) bordering Costa Tropical, **my best tip** is spend less time in the high-rise monstrosity, package-tour areas of the western Costa del Sol like Torremolinos, Puerto Banus , [Benalmádena](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/ahh-arab-baths-andalusia-spa-malaga-granada-benalmedena-massage-hotspringsthemal-water-roman.html), Fuengirola and [Marbella](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/marbella.html). You will miss the authenticity and  awesome natural beauty of this area of Spain and will see little difference between it and  the suburban sprawl of Southern California, Miami Beach, Honolulu, [Benidorm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benidorm) , [Costa Brava](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/top-10-costa-brava-secret-gems-spain.html) or any over built beach area that caters to holidays or vacations  in the sun.

**Tip number two**, skip the summer high season because it is over crowded and hotter than the dickens ( usually well above 100 so you will be dripping sweat even in the shade.) I agree with the Spaniards that it is insane to visit Andalusia in July and August. If you want to visit Spain then, be smart like a Spaniard and head to green Northern Spain which is often rainy, but quite pleasant in July and August and not crowded in places like [gorgeous Galicia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/gorgeous-galici.html). Even [Madrid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/botin-restauran.html) is too hot in summer then and the whole government moves to [San Sebastian](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/seaside-resort-san-sebastian-spain-donostia.html) for July and August. Thus, think [Galicia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/post.html), [Austrias](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/post-1.html), [Bilbao](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/wow-guggenheim-bilbao-.html), or [beautiful Santillana](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/sublime-santill.html#more) and [Altamira,the Sistine chapel of prehistoric art](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/11/altamira-sistin.html).The good news is that prices are also better in the Costa Del Sol when the weather is best. The summer heat is only for the sun-starved Brits and northern Europeans that are desperate for some sun in summer as they often get very little at home even in July and August.

**Tip three** head to the rural areas and a [classic small white village,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html)  .there are [many to choose](http://www.andalucia.com/villages/home.htm) from. You will be able to walk to everything you need in the village and get a sense of the authentic lifestyle of Andalusia plus great little restaurants, stores and every rental or small hotel  has a pool Mass transit is great in the Costa del Sol and you can rent a car quite cheaply to visit other nearby areas like [Ronda](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/road-to-ronda.html), [Seville](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/ole-sublime-sev.html), [Granada](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/la-alhambra.html) or [Cordoba](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/cordoba.html) and the [Mesquita](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/cordoba.html) ( all must-sees). It's particularly [nice to be in a traditional rental home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/our-winter-home.html) right [on the main street](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/playing-in-the.html) in the oldest section of town. Even better, try to schedule your time there when there is a [festival going on](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/most-magical-mu.html) which is pretty easy to do in Andalusia because there are so many.

**Tip four** is come in springtime which is probably the very best time to be here. All of these photos were taken in the last three months. The locals tell me that it is not this green in the summer as the hot sun bakes everything. It's warm enough to go to the beach, but not too warm to also hike around the country side or beautiful little villages. Wild flowers are just everywhere! Fall is another nice time and we enjoy the whole winter here which are mostly sunny, but can get cool at night.

We will really miss our beautiful winter home as we have fallen in love with this area and [it's people](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/village-people.html#more). We will miss the sounds of the [horses](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/yummy-beach-lun.html) clomping by, the [oxen carts](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-photo-spain-around-the-world-travel-ox-traditional-white-village-expat-lifestyle.html), the braying donkeys, baaing sheep,roosters and church bells or loud firecrackers announcing [another holiday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/carnival-espana.html#more).  It has been a little bittersweet this winter knowing we will start wintering in Asia starting this year so that Mozart can immerse deeply in her Mandarin at a school there. Thankfully, we will be back every spring and  to pick up our RV to do a summer tour of Europe then back in the fall when we leave it here to fly off on more world wandering. . There is still plenty of the Costa del Sol ( sun coast) that is pure, stunning and authentic. Bargain prices too!

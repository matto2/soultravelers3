The [Greek Islands](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/greece/ "greek islands") are beautiful and romantic, but amazingly kid friendly as well and can be done luxuriously on a low budget. Gorgeous, diverse beaches ( black, red, white sand); picturesque, walkable towns; healthy, yummy food; easy transportation ( be it ferry, bus or plane); wonderful culture and educational opportunities and warm locals make it an ideal family vacation destination.  
  
**BEST BUDGET HOTEL IN SANTORIN**I  
  
If you skip high season July and August, [Greece rocks for family travel.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/heaven-on-earth.html "Greece for family travel") This beautiful photo of the famous Oia sunset on Santorini was taken from this [lovely, family friendly, budget hotel](http://www.volcanosvillas.com/ "hotel in Santorini") right on the caldera.  
  
**GREEK ISLAND TRAVEL TIP**  
  
( If you must travel to Greece in July and August, expect the crowds and head to a smaller, off the beaten track island like [visiting Samos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/ferry-to-samos.html "visiting samos") that is not crowded at all then when islands like Santorini and [Mykonos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/mykonos-town.html "Mykonos Island travel") are insanely packed).  
  
**BEST BUDGET BUNGALOWS AND CAMPING IN SANTORINI**  
  
We spent a [glorious month vacation just in Santorini](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/03/heavenly-month-in-santorini-greece.html#more "Glorious month vacation in Santorini") and kept to our $23/day per person budget easily and we even rented a car for a few days, then we were off to explore the best Greek Islands before [returning to Santorini](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/hello-goodbye-s.html "santorini in August"), then off toÂ  explore more of the [best of mainland Greece](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/mycenae-agamemn.html "best of Greece travel"). We [camped](http://www.santorinicamping.gr/ "santorini campsite") using our small RV, but they have places for tents and cheap but cute bungalows at [Camping Santorini](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/santorini-campi.html "Camping Santorini"). May, June, September and October are wonderful times to visit Santorini or Mykonos.

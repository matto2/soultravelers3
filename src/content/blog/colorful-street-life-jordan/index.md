We loved the colorful street life in [Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "Jordan travel"). Just wandering the streets in any foreign location, is one of the great [pleasures of travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "Pleasures of travel") in my book, getting a glimpse into every day life in another part of the world. Different clothes, written language, smells, [food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/jordan-means-delicious-food.html "Jordan food"), markets, sounds...delight the senses.  
  
One of the great things about a [trip to Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "trip to Jordan") is the amazing diversity, which I didn't fully expect, from [Petra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "trip to petra, jordan") to the [luxurious Dead Sea](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/dead-sea-delights-for-families.html "visiting dead sea"), to a [honeymoon suite in the desert in Wadi Rum](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/wadi-rum-bedouin-honeymoon-suite-.html "wadi rum"), to the amazing [Four Seasons in Amman](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/amazing-family-fun-at-four-seasons-amman.html "four seasons hotel amman, jordan"), not to mention the many places I have yet to write about. From modern cities, to nomad camps. from green forests to World Heritage Sites, from eco friendly lodgings to first class hotels..Jordan has it all.  
  
What about you, do you learn as much by wandering around a place as you do by seeing the iconic spots?

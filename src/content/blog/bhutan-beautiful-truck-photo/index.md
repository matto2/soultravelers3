Even the trucks are beautiful and colorful in Bhutan, land of the thunder dragon! I hear now that they do a similar type of decoration on trucks in neighboring India as well, but we had never seen it before. There is only one road in the whole country of Bhutan and it is still being built ( that is a whole story by itself that is coming soon as the method stunned us).  
  
The roads in Bhutan are good by the main cities, but in the interior and high mountain passes they can be quite scary, as the fall below is treacherous and they are still being built. Perhaps they have all the religious art on their trucks to give them good luck on the roads.

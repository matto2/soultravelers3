We are in [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Penang rental apartment") to help our child [immerse in her Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "immerse in Mandarin in Asia") in a local [Chinese school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/chinese-school-fun.html "Chinese school")l, as we [world school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school ") through [travel around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "travel around the world").  
  
Lots of [beauty in Malaysia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "second home in Penang, Malaysia"), but we didn't expect this rural tropical paradise feel right here on Penang Island, as most of the action is around [UNESCO World Heritage site, Georgetown](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Unesco Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia"), which is built up with towers and has a totally different feel. This area is not visited by tourists, but we have local friends who have farm property here and know it well, so we will be exploring more.  
  
It did remind us of rural Kauai, Bora Bora and Moorea and those are all places that interests us, so time to explore more in our own back yard. Of course, this is not easy, by [bus in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/getting-around-penang-by-bus.html "getting around by bus in Penang"), but we'll find a way.

One of the cool things we did on our amazing [family journey to Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "family vacation jordan"), was a private boat trip in Aqaba on the Red Sea. It doesn't look at all like one's perception of the Middle East as it was a luxury resort area where we got on board, yet we could see Egypt, Israel, [Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "Jordan tourism") and Saudi Arabia from our boat. An azure sea surrounded by deserts, blue sky and palm trees.  
  
It's interesting that it is not far from Elat in Israel where I had been long ago. I enjoyed comparing this Jordanian perspective of both the Red Sea as well as the [Dead Sea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/dead-sea-delights-for-families.html "dead sea travel") from a different country as well as different decade. The [diversity in Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/wadi-rum-jordan.html "Jordan diversity wadi rum") really impressed us ( as well as the [Jordanian food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/jordan-means-delicious-food.html "great jordanian food") and [people](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/people-of-jordan.html "Jordan people")).  
  
We could have done some diving, which I hear is fabulous, but we were content to just enjoy the views and sea breezes as we zipped along. We stayed at another lovely [Movenpick Resort](http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/hotels_resorts/worldmap/aqaba/welcome.cfm "Movenpick resort aqaba, Jordan") ( some how I was not aware of this great hotel brand before our [trip to Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "family trip to Jordan")).

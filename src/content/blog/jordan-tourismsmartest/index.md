Have you noticed all the buzz  
about Jordan of late? If you  
follow travel online, you know

Have you noticed all the buzz about Jordan of late? If you follow travel online, you know that Jordan has been a very hot topic. [Jordan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan") and [Petra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra "Petra") have long been on our bucket list and we always thought we'd do Egypt, Israel ( I 've been to both, but the rest of the family has not) and Jordan together.  
  
Sadly, both my [broken arm/surgery/paralysis from biking the Danube](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "medical emergency while traveling") and another [medical emergency on the road](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/11/bloody-monday-i.html "medical emergency on the road") put a halt to our planned trips to the Middle East twice. Like many people, especially families with a young child, we had some concerns about going to this often conflicted area and the recent disturbances in Egypt, Tunsia, Syria, Libya, Bahrain etc. didn't help.  
  
[![Jordan is an oasis of peace in the middle east](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e88bad8e4970d.jpg "Jordan is an oasis of peace in the middle east")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e88bad8e4970d.jpg)  
  
  
But we did [go to Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "Go to Jordan vacation") for 10 days this May and found it to be a peaceful oasis in the Middle East, one of the most peaceful, beautiful and special  places that we have been to ( out of 42 countries on 5 continents in these last 5 years).  
  
[![Jordan tourism is smart!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330154329a8543970c.jpg "Jordan tourism is smart!")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330154329a8543970c.jpg)

Sometimes you have to just go yourself to understand what the true experience is.We had always heard that the people of Jordan are some of the friendliest on the planet and we happily found out that is very accurate. They seem to really want you to know and enjoy Jordan.

I've long been a fan of [Queen Rania](http://www.youtube.com/user/QueenRania "Queen Rania of Jordan") of Jordan and think she has some very good points about how important it is today to break down the many false stereotypes about the Arab world.

Many Americans and even Europeans are afraid to travel to the Middle East and we got many warnings before going.( You are taking your child??)  Some have fear of Muslims, yet we have found Islamic countries to be some of the most welcoming cultures ( [Morroco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/sahara-violin-c.html#more "Morocco"), [Malaysia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia"), [Turkey](http://soultravelers3new.local/turkey/ "turkey travel") and Jordan). The Jordanians seem to really love their King and Queen and studies show that people more content with their leaders are happier. It's truly amazing to me that they have become "the neutral Switzerland" of the Middle East.

Our itinerary included the enchanting Dead Sea, Wadi Rum, Amman, Red Sea, Aquaba, Petra, Karak, Mt Nemo ( where Moses was buried)  and much more. We were honored to be the only travel blogging family to be invited by the Jordan Tourism Board.  
  
[![Our Bedouin at Wadi Rum in tradional clothes and sunglasses](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e88baf688970d.jpg "Our Bedouin at Wadi Rum in tradional clothes and sunglasses")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e88baf688970d.jpg)  
  
  
But we are not the only travel bloggers who were invited to Jordan these last few months and I think this makes Jordan Tourism one of the smartest on the planet. They were innovative and took a bad situation of political instability in the Middle East that creates fear and thus lowers tourism, and by working together ( [hotels](http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/homepage.cfm "movenpick hotels "), restaurants, guides, [Royal Jordanian Airlines](http://www.rj.com/ "Royal Jordanian airlines"), Tourism Board etc) created a big win/win for all.  
  
Their idea was to let people see for themselves through inviting travel bloggers. We choose not to do normal press trips that most travel writers/bloggers do where a bunch of writers all go to the same place at the same time and do the same things. Sounds so unappealing. But this was done differently and  geared to each traveler and at different times. Our trip  was geared toward family travel in Jordan. Amongst other things, we're the only one's who went to the wonderful Children's Museum there (the only one of it's kind in the Middle East) which kidlet loved and joyfully connected with Jordanian school kids.  
  
[![Children's Museum in Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330154329a9bcb970c.jpg "Children's Museum in Jordan")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330154329a9bcb970c.jpg)  
  
  
I loved Leslie's post about the [value of these kind of travel blogger trips](ttp://downtowntraveler.com/2011/05/18/the-value-of-blogger-press-trips-interview-with-jordan-tourism-boards-nayef-al-fayez/ "Value of travel bloggers press trips") with a great interview with the Managing Director of Jordan Tourism Board. She traveled to Jordan recently with a delegration of tourism leaders. It is not an accident that Jordan's Twitter account [@visitjordan](http://twitter.com/VisitJordan "@visitjordan on twitter") is popular and they are one of the most influencial tourism boards online. They're smart!

"Bloggers differ from traditonal media outlets because they give a more realistic, firsthand account of the country they are visiting, especially in times of special circumstance. What is more, their coverage is more immediate and can sometimes be more influential" Nayef Al-Fayez ( Jordan Tourism Board)  
  
As I talked about in our  [BBC interview about how social media is changing travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "Soultravelers3 BBC interview on social media and travel"), the smart tourism folks are paying attention, while some of the dinosaurs snooze. The [statistics on social media and travel](http://www.stikkymedia.com/articles/social-media-and-the-tourism-industry-statistics#comment-131 "statistics social media and travel") speaks for itself. You don't have to be the biggest or richest tourism board or top travel blogger to be influencial, there are many niches within travel. We are all affected by digital and social media today and it can be a winning tool that can help many people. All the people who work in tourism in Jordan ( their top industry)  as well as the people who want to travel there but need to know what it's like NOW on the ground. Often times when tourism is down, it's the best time to visit.

Jordan Tourism recently invited [Uncornered Market](http://www.uncorneredmarket.com/ "uncornered market"), [Ken Kaminesky](http://kenkaminesky.com/ "Ken Kaminesky"), [The Planet D](http://theplanetd.com/ "the planet d"), [Solo Traveler](http://solotravelerblog.com/ "solo traveler"), [LandLopers](http://landlopers.com/ "landlopers"), [Wild Junket](http://www.wildjunket.com/ "wild junket"), [Bald Hiker](http://www.baldhiker.com/ "baldhiker"), and [TravelDudes](http://www.traveldudes.org/ "traveldudes"), if you should want to learn more about Jordan from many different perspectives. They also invited [Legal Nomads](http://www.legalnomads.com/ "legal nomads") and [A Little A Drift](http://alittleadrift.com/ "a little drift"). We know all of these folks because the world of travel bloggers who have been around for a while is small.  
  
We had a quick breakfast meeting with Jodi and Shannon as their last day in Jordan happened to coincide with our first day at the Dead Sea (which we discovered by accident on Twitter), so hooked up, despite being at different hotels. Fun! Mozart is planning on taking her own solo around-the-world trip ( or with her [best friend](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "best friends while traveling"), well traveled Maria in Barcelona), so was happy to get some scoops about such from these two. She was also VERY impressed that Shannon lives near [Wizarding World of Harry Potter](http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/ "wizarding world of harry potter") as she is dreaming of that destination for her next birthday and is [HP's biggest fan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSB7Gictlag "Harry potter fan at hogwarts").

99.9% of our travel remains self funded ( on 23 dollars a day per person) and self initiated because unlike many travel writers and bloggers, that is what we do...travel...as a lifestyle, as a family...non-stop for these last 5 years with no end in sight. The world is our home and school. We don't blog to support our travels or as our way to support ourselves, but as a passion to help others and document our travels for our child. We didn't set out to become [digital nomad travel trend setters](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html "digitalnomad travel trendsetters"), but feel a certain responsibility to let others know that they CAN live thier dreams. Or as a friend recently said to us:  
  
"Keep doing what you're doing, you are changing the world, and how people think - and what could be better than that!?!?!"  [Brooke Ferguson](http://www.businessbackpacker.com/ "Brook Ferguson")  
  
We tend to like to do our own thing at our own pace, so  despite having very high Klout and Peerindex scores, we rarely take the many offers of sponsorship that we get, nor do we do text ads, or sponsored posts that others write as many travel bloggers do, or even guest bloggers. Freedom and loving are most important to us and we want to only support brands/places that we really believe in and that align with our values.

Sometimes it just makes sense, like this [trip to Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "trip to Jordan") ( and [Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/travel-to-bhutan-.html "travel to bhutan") the week before) as both were on our way back to [Europe for the summer](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "travel Europe summer") after [wintering in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "wintering in asia").  I had always heard wonderful things about the exeptional hospitality and beauty of both. We have a spiritual focus and believe just walking the land in peaceful ways can possibly add positive energy to the region. We love history, educational opportunities and countries with strong spiritual focus. We knew we'd love Jordan and that we could help our readers know more about it through our writing and photos and also help the people who live there that are dependent on tourism and travelers.

I actually almost missed both trips at the last minute, because I was dealing with a very odd but severe digestive problem. Thankfully TSA let me get through all check points with all my herbs from my TCM doctor ( without going though machines) and both the cultures of Jordan and Bhutan understand the value of herbs. Jordan is also known for it's food, so I am glad we didn't miss that!  
  
How long do you think it will take other countries to get as smart as Jordan Tourism has been?

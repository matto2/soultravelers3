This is one of a series of videos we have shot of Mozart playing violin in key places around the world that we are doing to commemorate our special world tour. We are in the process of editing a compilation of all that we have taken thus far, but thought we would show one since some have been asking for them. This is in Provence, France just days after Mozart’s sixth birthday at the world heritage site of Pont du Gard, the highest Roman aqueduct ever built. She is playing “Perpetual Motion” on her third violin which is a 1/16  size.

My weight loss story is not one of overnight success. My [weight loss journey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/weight-loss-transformation/) has been a roller coaster ride of trials, and LOTS of errors and failures along the way. I turn 71 in mid March and I had hoped to reach my final goal by that date, but alas, I am still 18lbs short of my goal weight. I have a few weeks to get closer, ( aiming to be just ten pounds over at this point) yet I could have reached that goal, but didn't. Best tip? Please don't let failures stop you as they are just part of the process!  
  
![Weight loss journey over 50 how i lost over 100lbs at 70](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b75173be1b200b-150x150-1.jpg)  
 I could see not reaching my goal by my birthday as a failure, and mentally judge & beat myself up, OR I could see the perfection of it all, accept life as it is, and know that I WILL  still reach that goal sooner or later. I tend to gain a bit on my maintenance phase so it might take until next fall or winter to finalize and meet my ultimate goal. So that discourages a part of me. I may even change my goal and make it ten pounds thinner if I feel that is needed. I am losing slower now as I get closer to my final goal and mostly that is my own fault, partly it's because I am basically  happy at this weight which has me in a "normal" range for my age. I love feeling so fit and energetic like I am twenty again! Partly it is also because I am being less strict on my diet. Instead of one apple for desert , I might have three or get into some nuts or pumpkin seeds.  So not huge errors, but not staying super strict. Partly also, plateaus seem to be more prevalent as one gets closer to the goal.I still have a little too much fat on my body, so I will keep working on it and exercise more to be even more fit and work on my longevity goals.

I am really loving walking on the beach every morning, enjoying my salads on my terrace in the sunshine every day. These good habits suit me and I find easy ways to support myself. Here are some no make up mirror selfies after my beach walk workouts. It often surprises me still when I look into the mirror now, yet even at my heaviest I always dreamt and thought of myself as this normal size. The fat me in the mirror was always a shock so I avoided it.

Am I skinny? Not yet. Do I feel like twenty instead of 70, absolutely and I love that!! I still have more to go and more to learn along the way, but this is truly the best thing I have ever done for myself and I want to be slender and fit now for the rest of my life. Better late than never!

I love feeling vibrantly alive again and free as a kid or a bird! I even love how different my face feels and how "bony" my body feels even just like scratching my face or arm. It is like." whoa, whose body is this"? I'd forgotten what it feels like to be in a thinner body in lots of little ways. Also, unfortunately, guys are hitting on me again, which is NOT something I expected at my age, after many years of enjoying being invisible. One must take the bad with the good and perhaps I should be flattered, but I had more than my share of that when I was  young, so it just seems so odd now.

I will start writing a book about how I did this and what I have learned along the way, so let me know if you have any questions or areas you want covered in the ebook!

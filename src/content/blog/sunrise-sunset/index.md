Sunrise, [sunset](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/family-travel-photo-spain-family-travel-sunset-on-road-trip-in-europe-andalusia-4hww-rolf-potts-tim-.html "stunning sunset"), swiftly flow the days! Blues, purples, pinks, yellows and reds light the dawn each day here as the sun rises and I am grateful for another day on this tropical island. It's such a peaceful time of day and I enjoy taking it in from our terrace daily, letting the cool morning breeze caress my face.  
  
One of our great pleasure in [our Penang apartment](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Our penang apartment"), is this daily ritual. The [sunrises](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/beautiful-sunrises-and-sunsets.html "Beautiful sunrises and sunsets") and [sunsets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/awesome-sunset.html "awesome sunset") here are almost always spectacular. My heart fills with gratitude for this gift of life. We never seem to know the time or day any more, we live on "nowO'clock" but the sunrises and sunsets, let us know time is passing, even in this mellow seasonless tropical country.  
  
“If you want to be reminded of the love of the Lord, just watch the sunrise.” ―Jennette Walls“There's a sunrise and a sunset every single day, and they're absolutely free. Don't miss so many of them.” -Jo Walton  
  
  
Are your days and years flowing by as quickly as ours are? Hard to believe we are approaching our 7th year anniversary of being purposely homeless as [we travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html#more "we travel the world as a family"). Are you taking the time to enjoy the miraculous sunrises and sunsets wherever you are?  
  
Perhaps the world's best free entertainment.

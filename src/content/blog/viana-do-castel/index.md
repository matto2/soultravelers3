Despite our problematic entry and it being dark, we could still see that Viana do Castelo in northern Portugal was a lovely place. I even got a picture of the picturesque harbor with moon over it as we went by it for about the tenth time. Had we not been so flustered by being lost, we think we could have enjoyed the [pretty, open plaza](http://www.portugalvirtual.pt/_tourism/costaverde/viana.do.castelo/ukcity.html) where we ended up with our RV or the area down below, near the water where there was a festival of some kind going on.

We stayed at [this campground](http://www.alanrogers.com/campsite-info.php?SiteARNo=PO8020&signup=no) which is very popular with windsurfers ( many from Germany and the Netherlands)  and on a [pristine beach](http://www.portugalvirtual.pt/_tourism/costaverde/viana.do.castelo/index.html). It was not very crowded when we were there in June. Mozart played in their playground and took a quick dip in their pool and met some little friends from the Netherlands that she played with.

We will have to do a video just on all the amazing playgrounds that she has enjoyed in Europe. We find them in campgrounds, beaches, cities and parks where ever we go. This did look like a nice area, but time was pushing us onward and we were itching to see the famous [Santiago de Compostela](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Compostela) by this point, as we have been reading about it for so long.

So we said good bye to Portugal for now, jumped on the AP9 and were soon enjoying the beautiful views of [Vigo](http://www.planetware.com/spain/vigo-e-gal-vig.htm) ....our first glance at Galicia, Spain. Instantly, we could see that this green, [Celtic Spain](http://usuarios.lycos.es/Celtic_Galiza/index.html) was the polar opposite of  our beloved Andalusia and looked very different than anything else we have seen on the Iberia Peninsula. We did not stay long in Vigo because I read there was not much to see there, but it is a beautiful place to pass through and the views  of the sea enthralled us as we headed towards Santiago.

What is your favorite [castle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/family-travel-austria-castle-photo-.html "castel photo europe austria") in [Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/best-places-to-visit-in-europe.html "best places to visit in Europe")? I'm not sure I could pick one, as we've seen so many stunning castles on our years of [road trips around Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "6 month road trip around Europe") from [Pena Palace](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/pena-palace.html "Pena Palace") to  [Blarney](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/blarney-castle-cork-ireland.html "blarney castle ") to [Carcassone](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/carcassonne-med.html "Carcassonne castle") to [the Alhambra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/-alhambra-moorish-palace-in-granada-with-gypsy-guitar.html "the alhambra ") and more.

We explored many castles in the Loire Valley and the Château de Chenonceau was a delight for [Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/06/mozart-sings-everything-we-are-original-song-supporting-environment.html "Beautful teen singer Mozart sings Everything we are") and the whole family.

As I mentioned in [5 Best European Vacations](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "5 best european family vacations"), [France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/france/ "France travel tips") is the number one travel destination in Europe and the [UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Loire Valley](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/933) is one of France's most popular tourist destinations. They get more than 3.3 million visitors per year, so castles are popular.

But Chenonceau and all of the Loire Valley, was not crowded at all when we were there, so we had a grand time exploring it deeply and slowly.

Many say that the Château de Chenonceau is the  most family-friendly as there are lots of options for  walking around and exploring inside and out. We actually found all the castles in the Loire Valley family friendly and educational.

There are gorgeous gardens to explore, bridges, moats and magic in the air that will make any kid feel like royalty.

There are even kayaks or a boat to hire here that let you  go back and forth directly beneath the castle arches. Being a travel princess, [Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/06/wings-mozart-rocks-little-mix-and-lookssings-like-a-pop-star.html "Teen singer Mozart rocks like a pop star wings") found it all divine! Have you seen this castle?

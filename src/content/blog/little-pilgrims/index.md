One does not tend to think of pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela as "family travel", especially with a young child, but it was an extraordinary way to experience it together that I can highly recommend. Seeing things through a child's eyes opened my heart in ways that I would have missed if we did it alone.

We too, feel like pilgrims in our own way, as a family can not take a world touring journey like ours without great dedication and trust or without learning more about ones soul.  
  
The energy is very special in Santiago de Compostela, perhaps because so many have been so happy and grateful when they arrived.We felt a wonderful mix of blissful joy, gratitude and sacredness.  
  
Internationally bestselling  author Paul Coehlo said:  
  
"My turning point was my pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. It was then that I, who had dedicated most of my life to penetrate the 'secrets' of the universe, realized that there are no secrets. Life is and will always be a mystery. Life is a constant miracle, and this miracle manifests itself in encounters with other people. After the pilgrimage, I simplified my spiritual search a lot, and instead of searching for answers, I started to understand that life itself is an answer."  
  
We will always cherish our family pilgrimage to Santiago and Galicia...beautiful Celtic Spain. Mozart was 7 & quickly drew the picture of the little pilgrim on a napkin when we were not looking, while waiting for a meal. She is dressed in the brown cape and hat that is the traditional dress of a pilgrim from the middle ages to experience what that might have been like.

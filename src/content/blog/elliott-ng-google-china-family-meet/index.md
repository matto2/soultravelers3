Elliott Ng is a great guy, the head  
of Google in China, and I have known  
him through Twitter for many years

[Elliott Ng](http://elliottng.com/about "Elliott Ng") is a great guy, the [head of Google in China](http://cnreviews.com/people/entrepreneurs/elliott-ng-update-googl_20110104.html "elliott Ng Google director in China"), and I have known him through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soultravelers3 "Twitter") for many years ( 2008) where we were both early adopters, interested in [travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/travel/ "travel tips"), [China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/china/ "China travel"), doing good, education and financial trends.  
  
Elliott is a Harvard educated geek and I am likely one of the biggest "ungeeks" on the planet, but we both were on Twitter early when it was new and exciting way to connect and enjoyed communicating.  
  
I got on Twitter because of [our travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate family adventure RTW") ( to use it as a quick [communication](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "travel disaster") option), so was one of the first in travel blogs using it and met fantastic people through it.  
  
In this [post about twitter](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/travel-blogger-love-followfriday-on-twitter-social-media-best-in-travel.html "post about Twitter") in the summer of 2010,  I recommended Elliott Ng as "Great heart, dad of three & smart guy plus my go-to-person for everything China!" I met [Winser Zhao](http://www.chinatravel20.com/ "winser Zhao china travel 2.0") (who helped us so much on our [China trip)](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "China trip"), through Elliott...small world.

The Ng's are from Silicon Valley area like us, but living in Shanghai now. We planned this Chinese play date with the kids on Twitter before they moved to China in 2011!  
  
We had a fabulous time meeting at the legendary luxurious  [Fairmont Peace Hotel](http://www.fairmont.com/peace-hotel-shanghai/ "fairmont shanghai") in Shanghai.They live in the suburbs and Elliott does an unbelievable amount of transcontinental flying for his job, so it was super sweet of them to make this time to meet with us.  
  
![happy expat family from California in China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73da36dd9970d.png)  
  
I won't mention his wife and kids names online as I am not sure if they do that or not, but it was fantastic to finally meet them in person. So funny how social media makes you feel like you know people well even when you have not met them in person.  
  
I've never been disappointed by any friendships made online when we do meet. Earlier on our [trip to China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/04/china-travel-ancient-land-of-mystery.html "trip to china"), Elliott went out of his way to catch my speech in Beijing at [Good People Helping Good People/](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/good-people-helping-good-people-%E8%B4%B5%E4%BA%BA%E7%9B%B8%E5%8A%A9.html "good people meeting good people in Beijing")贵人相助 and we also met at an expat hangout in the [Hutong area of Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/real-beijing-hutong-nights.html "Hutong Beijing") where he had a huge crowd waiting to connect with him. This guy is the epitome of a "people person" and connector.  
  
![California kids in China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73da36df2970d.png)  
  
His eldest son loves Chinese chess and was kind enough to give Mozart a game as a gift and taught her how to play. These two seemed to make an instant connection - California kids in China, straddling two worlds!  
  
![Yum! Great food at Fairmont  Peace Hotel  in Shanghai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fce8b165970b.png)  
  
We all enjoyed munching on the amazing spread at the Peace Hotel executive Floor, then half us a rode and half of us walked the short distance to a beautiful Yunnan cuisine restaurant called [Lost Heaven](http://www.lostheaven.com.cn/aboutus.aspx "Yunnan restaurant Shanghai Lost Heaven") a few blocks away where they treated us to one of our best dinners in China.  
  
The little ones are energetic 3 and 5 year old boys, so I had to admire how good their mom was at keeping them occupied with books and drawing etc like I use to do with Mozart and laughed to see the organic milk cartons that they "self- import" with Elliott's travels. Expat and travel families always find ways to make things work!  
  
![Elliott Ng, Mozart and family walking The Bund in Shanghai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73da36e3c970d.png)  
  
It was very enlightening to talk to them about their experience of living in China and I will be doing an interview for those of you wondering what the experience is like for a family.  They have lived in both Beijing and Shanghai and I was intriguied when they said it was very comparable to living in Silicon Valley.

I enjoyed the walk back to the hotel taking in the awesome [Shanghai skyline](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/shanghai-skyline-worlds-best-.html "shanghai skyline") as we talked and meandered along the famous [Bund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bund "the bund ") and will never forget the wisdom of their astute 5 year old.  
  
He pointed out, "There is old China on this side and new China across the river!". Some things you can only learn by being there.

What a joy to finally meet Elliott and his wonderful family and complete that playdate promised so long ago.  
  
Do you have any specific questions for me to ask them in my interview? Are you as surprised as we were about how luxurious living in Shanghai can be?

Do you enjoy cutting down your own [Christmas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/worlds-best-christmas.html "world's best christmas") tree? This has been a family tradition in our family before [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "Mozart trilingual travek kid expert speaker") was born and we did it with her during her first five years in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "top 10 California destinations").

In this photo above [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/12/mozart-sings-youre-not-alone-on-the-radio-possibly-a-movie.html "teen singer Mozart sings \"You're Not Alone\" on the radio and in a movie") is just a year old and already loving the "adventure of tree chopping" for a [Christmas family tradition](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "How to enjoy family travel abroad at Christmas") and you can see it again when she was a little older in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxBFv5AAxhw "best Christmas youtube video"):

But due to 9 years of [non-stop world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "around the world family travel with soultravelers3"), we didn't keep up with this [Christmas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/christmas-holiday-travel-ideas-for-family-getaways.html "Christmas holiday travel ideas") tradition as things were different in [Spain during the holidays](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/12/xmas-evela-noch.html "Christmas in Spain ") and [Christmas in tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/tropical-christmas-abroad-in-asia.html "Christmas in tropical Asia") was totally different.

We loved those experiences and how they enriched us and you can see that in our latest [Christmas Medley video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc5u4fcIpZI&list=UUcMwuQFsEJfOct29ZTa0v8w "Merry Christmas Medley with Mozart") showing Mozart photos through her Christmas pasts in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/home-for-the-holidays.html "home for the holidays"), [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/01/santa-come-or-p.html "Christmas in Spain"), [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/christmas-in-asia-happy-holidays.html "Christmas in Asia"), [Malaysia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/first-christmas-in-asia.html "Christmas in Malaysia") and [Christmas markets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/christmas-markets-in-europe-dont-miss.html "Christmas markets in Europe") in [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best europe family vacations") .

This year, we are back in the United States, so once again, can pick up our cut-your-own-tree tradition. We just googled it and found many farms in the nearby countryside within an hour from [Dallas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/dallas-luxury-resort-arriving-to-big-d-in-style.html "Dallas Four Seasons arrival"). Their busiest time is the day after [Thanksgiving](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/11/giving-thanks-and-thanksgiving-around-the-world.html "giving thanks on Thanksgiving"), but we prefer to do it on Solstice.

[14 year old Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/10/mozart-sings-at-the-house-of-blues.html "teen Mozart sings at the House of Blues") had missed this family treat, although it is a little bit different in [Texas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/omg-snow-in-dallas.html "snow in dallas") than it was in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/california-winter-beach-escape-.html "California winter beach escape"). We'd never seen some of these trees before, but summers get hot here, so this is what works and we love our tree.

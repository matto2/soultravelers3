One of the best things about [long term family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "long term family travel") is the people you meet, because they tell you a lot about the country and also about how much we have in common, no matter how different our lives are.  
  
We came upon these Bhutanese [nomad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad "nomad") women, totally alone, in the middle of no where, living at a very high altitude on what looked like the edge of a very undisturbed world, during our [Bhutan vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "bhutan vacation").  They were herding a large group of yaks and seemed as surpised to see us as we were to see them.

These Tibetan -Mongolian heritage,  Himalayan nomads seem very happy, despite living in a very inhospitable mountain landscape with little or no money. Is this their [GNH policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_happiness "Bhutan gross natioanl happiness policy GNH") or just their nature? We found a real [purity in Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "purity bhutan travel mother and child") and know the [Buddhism](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/buddhist-bhutan-bliss.html "buddhism in Bhutan") is part of what shapes this beautiful country.  
  
**WHAT CAN NOMAD LIVING TEACH US?**  
  
Our [travel to Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/travel-to-bhutan-.html "travel to bhutan") was an extraordinary experience and these [nomads](http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/nomads-photos/ "nomads") reminded us in a way of the first [nomads ( Berbers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/nomad-berber-li.html "nomads berber in sahara") in the [Sahara)](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/sahara-dream.html "sahara dream family vacation") we met on our [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "family world trip"). There is something about nomadic people that touches my heart.

Maybe it is because we [travel as a digital nomadic family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "travel as a digital nomad family"), but I think it is deeper, as they teach us all about our selves and a simpler time of being self reliant and one with nature. Kindness seems more important than competition, relationships more important than money, harmony more important than willfulness , love more important than things and cherishing the TIME to appreciate the abundance all around us.

This is a fun link [for kids about nomadic people](http://www.historyforkids.org/learn/government/nomads.htm "kids learn nomadic people") or learn more [about Bhutan.](http://www.tourism.gov.bt/ "learn about bhutan")  Interestingly, after Bhutan, we [went to Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "Jordan family vacation petra") where they have the ancient Bedouin nomadic people who also touched us.

  
  
"Traveling is brutality. It forces you to trust strangers and to lose sight of all that is familiar comfort of home and friends. You are constantly off balance. Nothing is yours except the essential things - air, sleep, dreams, the sea, the sky - all things tending towards the eternal or what we imagine of it." Pavese  
  
  
How about you? Have you met nomadic people when traveling? Do they touch your heart?

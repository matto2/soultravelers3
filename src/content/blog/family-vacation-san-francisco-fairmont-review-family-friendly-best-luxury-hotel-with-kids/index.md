As we entered our stunning room on the 23th floor at the [iconic Fairmont San Francisco](http://www.fairmont.com/sanfrancisco "Fairmont San Francisco"), our 10 year old child  squealed  "Oh my God, this is  heaven!" which was truly an accurate appraisal as it is the Grande Dame of all the extraordinary hotels in [San Francisco](http://www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com/ "san francisco") and very impressive no matter how many luxury hotels one has stayed at. We left our hearts in San Francisco!

    

The world-reknown Fairmont brand is known for their exemplary service and hospitality, with so much attention to details, that they make their guests  feel totally  at home while basking in such luxury and beauty. No wonder so many presidents and movie stars have stayed here!

The  breathtaking panoramic views of San Francisco from our tower room atop Nob Hill made our jaws drop as the gorgeous sunny day allowed us to see all of our beloved home city from the [Golden Gate Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge "golden gate bridge") to the [Transamerica Pyramid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transamerica_Pyramid "transamerica pyramid"), plus [Coit Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower "coit tower"), Alcatraz, Marin county, Oakland and more. I will do a post on just the views, as having a drink at sunset or even watching the dawn arrive ( due to jet lag from Europe) were gifts beyond measure that [welcomed us home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "welcome us home") like nothing else could.

What a truly amazing homecoming for us to be complimentary guests at this spectacular luxury hotel as we haven't been [back to San Francisco in four years](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/last-day-in-san.html "back to san francisco") and The Fairmont San Francisco is the ultimate high end hotel for a city break, family vacation or romantic get away. We combined all three and it also gave us a chance to recover from jet lag from our rapid  flights from Spain to London to New York City to San Francisco and we felt it was important for Mozart to spend some time again in OUR city before we headed to [Santa Cruz for some beach and family time](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-santa-cruz-california-beautiful-beach-house-homeaway-luxury-rental-home.html "santa cruz beach and family time").  We even did a delightful  ["Tweet up"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/want-to-meet-us-in-london-sf-or-singapore-soultravelers3-travel-meetups-.html "tweet up") in the glamorous lobby with wonderful soultravelers3 blog readers which I will do a separate post about soon.

[![getting off BART to take cable car at Powell Street San Francisco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e1a7ca08970b.jpg "getting off BART to take cable car at Powell Street San Francisco")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e1a7ca08970b.jpg)

Built in 1907, The Fairmont San Francisco has the ideal location in central San Francisco and the only place in the city where all the cable car lines meet, thus excellent for easy city explorations. Most people probably arrive at this luxury hotel via car, but we jumped on the [BART](http://www.bart.gov/ "BART") from SFO airport with the locals that easily took us to Powell Street where we could catch a cable car to the hotel. It looked like it would be a little wait though, so we decided to jump in a cab for the short ride because we were so looking forward to being spoiled!

You can see the totality of our belongings for our 18 flights, 9 month [around-the-world family trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world family trip") this year in our 3 carry on bags in the shot below as well as Mozart's excitement. ( Davinci has both my carry-on rolling bag and his own technology filled daypack, including 3 laptops, homeschool supplies  & kiddo carries her own bag and purse of goodies like small toys).

 From the moment you arrive at The Fairmont San Francisco, you know you are in a very special place and you get warm welcome smiles from the doorman, to the people at the desk, housekeeping, bellboys to every employee that we ran into.

The opulent, timeless  lobby and public areas designed by prolific turn of the century architect Julia Morgan, ( one of our favorites)  enfolds you with warmth. The rich colors, sumptuous fabrics, gilt embellised ceilings, Corinthian columns, sensational spiral staircase, plants  and rococo furniture inspires and transports you in classic splendor.

The European palace ambiance and amenities continues in the large rooms with over sized marble  bathrooms ( both large, deep tub and separate large shower in ours), flat screen TVs, goose down pillows, extra long, comfortable mattresses and more. The two classic restaurants/bars, concierge, babysitting, views, health club, room service, wifi and best location in San Francisco make it the premiere luxury hotel in the City for families, business travelers and all.

Remember when I talked about [how social media is changing travel during our interview with the BBC](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "soultravelers3 interview bbc how social media is changing travel") recently? The [Fairmont Hotels](http://www.fairmont.com/ "fairmont hotels") are one of best in the hospitality industry doing social media and that is how we met. We also stayed at the [Fairmont Singapore](http://www.fairmont.com/singapore "fairmont singapore") recently , so have met quite a few people who work for Fairmont and we have been totally impressed.The people who work at these gorgeous luxury hotels are as beautiful and creative as the places and we made special friends who love travel as much as we do and who [care about the environment.](http://www.fairmont.com/EN_FA/AboutFairmont/environment/Endorsements/ "care about environment")

We toured the awesome Fairmont Penthouse, learned about how they are [working with bees](http://www.fairmont.com/sanfrancisco/articles/referencematerial/thefairmontsanfranciscointroduceshoneybeehivestonewculinarygarden.htm "working with bees"), visited their organic rooftop garden and interviewed their innovative new Chef. So we have more Fairmont stories coming and we are very proud to have them as a sponsor.

Kids and adults alike can learn a little history here, as you see my husband pointing out John F. Kennedy and other celebrities when they stayed at the Fairmont San Francisco ( Michelle Obama was also a recent visitor). We enjoyed learning about how the Fairmont was the host for the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945 and seeing those photos as well that line a public area on the way to our elevator.

We're from the Bay area ( I lived near Nob Hill when I was in my 20's  so have had drinks and dinner  there and Jazz fan DaVinci saw Ella Fitzgeraled, McCoy Tiner, Bill Evans, Tito Puente etc. in the Fairmont's  Venetian room ) so we know well the reputation of the Fairmont San Francisco as a local institution which is highly respected. It  was a great  honor indeed to stay at this magnificent hotel as guests and learn more about it and the people who take pride in making it work so well.

There is no where in the world  
quite like Europe in the summer  
and this year might be the best

There is no where in the world quite like [Europe in the summer](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "5 best European family vacations") and this year might be the best year ever to visit. [Wonderful beaches](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/winter-beach-beauty-of-southern-spain.html "wonderful beaches in Spain"), charming, [picturesque villages](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/croatia-travel-with-kids.html "Croatia Travel With Kids"), amazing, [diverse, historical cities](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/05/london-with-kids.html "London With Kids")... [Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2016/05/15-year-old-mozart-sings-at-carnegie-hall-.html "15 Year Old Mozart Sings at Carnegie Hall!!") and I can't wait to go back to some of our favorite places, see old friends, discover new places and experience her doing a pop [music tour after her Keynote Speech in Newcastle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2017/05/16-year-old-mozart-dees-ted-talk-keynote-speech-in-ukteen-actress-songwriter-singer-mozart-dee-was-asked-to-do-a-ted-talk.html#more "16 Year Old Mozart Dee's TED Talk & Keynote Speech in UK").   
  
**LONDON**   
  
![Best of Europe: Summer Trip ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb099c9c64970d.png)  
  
We love [London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-london-free-museums-educational-family-adventures-for-homeschool.html "Family Travel London: Free Museums!") and will be doing a concert there and lots of exploring. Mozart spent most of her primary years in Europe and can do a perfect ,authentic British accent, so it will be fun to get to see it all  as a teen now.   
  
**PARIS**  
  
![Best of Europe: Summer Trip - Paris Notre dame](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c8f9ae3e970b.png)  
  
[Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/paris-for-families-walking-the-left-bank.html "Paris for Families - Walking the Left Bank"), of course will be on the agenda as it is another city we love and have spent lots of time in. Summer is my favorite time to be in this City of Light.   
  
**BARCELONA**   
  
![Barcelona ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d2835f67970c.png)  
  
We've been to [Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "Barcelona Beach Resort") over 20 times, often for long stays, so it is like another home for us, thus we will be spending time there with friends along with some time in the Costa Brava ( shown in the first photo).   
  
**SCOTLAND**   
  
  
![Edinburgh Fringe Festival ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d2835fbe970c.png)  
  
  
We're looking forward to seeing [Edinburgh](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/family-travel-scotland-edinburgh-festival-photo.html "Family Travel Scotland: Edinburgh Festival") again as it is near the beautiful Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art where Mozart will be the Keynote Speaker and giving a concert. The last time we were there we enjoyed the famous Edinburgh Festival and we have Scottish roots so feel that tug.   
  
**ANDALUSIA**   
  
![Andalusia ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb099c392b970d.png)  
  
  

Of course, we can not miss our beloved [Andalusi](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/andalusia-pleasures.html "Andalusia Pleasures")a where we wintered for 5 years and the 6th year we returned after a trip around the world. [Mozart went to school there](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "Learning Spanish in Spain") from 1st through 4th grade before we headed to Asia for [Mandarin immersion](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "Mandarin immersion"), so it will be exciting to be back and she will perform concerts in a few places while there. So happy Mozart will have time to immerse in her Spanish...one might not even realize she is an English speaker when she is here.   
  
**PROVENCE**  
  

  ![Provence, France ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d2836166970c.png)

Another beloved region that we will be visiting is [Provenc](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/france-with-kids-exploring-provence.html "France with Kids - Exploring Provence")e which we have explored many times over the years. This time we will be visiting a few new places and a few we have seen before.   
  
With all that is going on in our world now, I think it is an important time to travel abroad as it expands our hearts and minds. What travel are you planning this year?

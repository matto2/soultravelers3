Is kissing the Blarney Stone on your bucket list?  [Blarney Castle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-ireland-blarney-stone-castles-exploring-adventure-motorhome.html "Blarney Castle") near Cork is a 15th Century medieval stronghold that remains one of the biggest tourist attractions in [Ireland.](http://soultravelers3new.local/ireland/ "Ireland tips")   
Kids love castles, iconic things like this and green open spaces to run around and explore**,** so no wonder it's a perfect day trip for families**.**  Climb up to the top via a narrow staircase, enjoy the views and bend over backwards **to** kiss the stone if you are looking for that gift of gab. ( With my [mobility challenges](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "traveling with a handicap or mobility challenges") I waited at the bottom).  
Bring a [healthy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "how to eat healthy and cheap in europe") [picnic lunch](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/budget-travel-norway-yummy-picnic.html "picnic lunch for budget travelers") and wander the fairy tale-like verdant grounds and gardens with winding paths throough waterfalls, streams, rocks and interesting places to explore. We took time out to do a little fiddling on the [violin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "kid playing violin around the world") for our [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "around the world traveling family") [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4 "youtube video soultravelers3") series.  
  
We spent quite a bit of time in County Cork and met some great people there because [our RV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/questions-answers-about-soultravelers3-family-travel.html#more) was [rear-ended in France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/car-wreck-in-france-dealing-with-disaster-road-trip-nightmare-car-accident-abroad-insurance-problems.html "car accident while traveling europe") on our way to catch the [ferry to Ireland](http://www.brittanyferries.ie/). Luckily, we found someone there to fix it well enough to last until we returned to [Spain for the winter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/grace-gratitude.html#more), thus we had lots of fun getting to know this area**

Isn't this an adorable restaurant in an Asian funky kind of way? I must admit, I haven't tried the food yet at this little gem in the UNESCO area of [Georgetown, Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "georgetown, penang"), but it always makes me smile when I walk by because it is so photogenic.  
  
Just another look at our series of photos about [life in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "our life in Asia") and [typical Malaysia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "typical Malaysia") as we share our [long term travel jouney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "long term travel journey") with you.

There is [World Cup](http://www.fifa.com/) fever going on [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) and [we, as travelers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html),  get a unique perspective with a European view. Since we are [camping in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html), we share the experience with many Europeans as they enjoy their summer holidays. We love this [Barcelona Beach Resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html) for many reasons, but one reason is the people we meet here as [camping Europe is like living in a global neighborhood](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html). Meeting Europeans and getting to know them better is part of the fun.

Last night my husband, DaVinci, was invited to our Spanish friends "next door" in the caravan next to us to watch the [World Cup game between Spain and Portuga](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249717/match=300061498/index.html?cid=google_onebox)l. Actually we were all invited, but I have no interest in sports, so Mozart also went, although she was mostly playing with their daughter and another local child who lives near by. The adults gathered outside  ( our friends plus their local friends and DaVinci) and  enjoyed the game mixed with the [local cava!](http://spainforvisitors.com/archive/features/cava.htm) I could tell by the shouts, fireworks and horns blowing around Barcelona that Spain won without ever seeing the game.

There are people from many different countries here and it is easy to tell where someone is from by their license plates. We have Belgium folks on one side, Spanish on the other side now, many Irish friends, Netherlands folks down below us, Swiss up the road, Brits around the corner, Germans two sites down, a Swede and so forth. Mozart talks in both her Spanish and English and is often a bridge between kids by connecting  and translating between the groups. We've known some people here for many years as this is our 9th or 10th time here on our [world tour since 2006](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) and some do extended travel here like us. Also locals from Spain return here regularly, so Mozart plays with many of the same kids year after year. It is a typical family-friendly European summer resort holiday atmosphere. [Campgrounds in Europe are social, fun, luxurious](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html), and relaxing places.

This year we've become good friends with a Spanish couple with a child who lives nearby who happened to park right across from us when we first arrived this season. While staying here they also continued to go to work some and their child went to school, but that left us plenty of time after 2 pm and weekends. Mozart has fallen in love with their dog and their little girl and we all really enjoy them all. They went back home for a week or two, but now they are back for a while and now they are parked next door instead of across the road from us. We even taught them about webcam calls and stayed in touch that way when they were at home which was a lot of fun for the girls. This resort is a fantastic place for kids in a safe environment.

Many of the people have flags to show their support to their countries and many campers have TV's or laptops to catch the games. There is also a nice restaurant and bar area here where many like to gather when the games are playing ( while others enjoy outside dining or dancing at the disco or hanging out at one of the pools etc.). I know nothing about football, soccer or any sport for that matter, but it's hard not to catch the [Wold Cup](http://www.fifa.com/) fever when one hears the random hooting and hollering from time to time. I usually know who is playing or when someone scores by who is doing the hooting and clapping.

   
We originally planned to be in South Africa this year, but one reason we changed our plans is that we did not want to be there in 2010 because of the World Cup and the crowds. For us, experiencing it here with many Europeans in a social way has been a lot more fun and a peek into another culture.

[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is about exploring exotic places together! For us, [Budapes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest)t seemed like an exotic place, but we found it to be a [world class city](http://www.budapestinfo.hu/en/general_information) and very charming. The drive from Vienna and Bucharest was pleasant and on excellent roads. We so loved the friends that we met in [Denve](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/castle-marne-trip-advisors-1-bb-in-denver.html)r and his parents were from Hungary so that experience, discussion about their travels in Hungary and sharing a traditional Hungarian meal with them added to our excitement.  
  
This is a photo of the [Hungarian Parliament Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Parliament_Building),  one of the most famous buildings in Budapest. Despite still dealing with some major medical disadvantages due to my [bad injury in Austria](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330120a63d94cf970c), I had insisted on wanting to at least see [Budapest](http://wikitravel.org/en/Budapest) on our way back to Spain last fall. Sadly, fall is not a great time to see Budapest as it was exceptionally cold and rainy. That, added to my medical challenges made it a short stay, but now at least we know we want to go back and explore it deeply some day soon when the weather is good.

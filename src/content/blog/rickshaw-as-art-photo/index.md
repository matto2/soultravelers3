Does art and beauty surround us and can we find it everywhere? We think so, and I've found that since I have taken up travel photography, I see it even more on our 7 year non-stop [Around-the-World trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "around-the-world trip family").  
DaVinci has started a collection of Rickshaw photos that he takes around [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Penang rental") as he [walks all over](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/walking-in-asia.html "walking all over Asia") UNESCO Heritage Site, [Georgetown](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Georgetown, Penang Unesco heritage site"), to handle our errands.  
  
I love them and thought you would too. Remember the [coconut rickshaw photo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/awesome-asian-coconut-rickshaw-photo.html "coconut rickshaw photo") the rickshaw in our [living in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "living in Asia") post, and this [rickshaw photo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/family-travel-asia-photo-georgetown-malaysia.html "rickshaw photo")? These are just a very few, but I will be posting more. Sometimes I wonder if I should do a series every week on the same day of rickshaw photos or if I should just do them randomly as the mood strikes. What do you prefer?  
  
We've never taken a ride in rickshaw yet, but these do capture an essense of Asia.Do you enjoy these photos like we do?

Belem is next to the sea and jam packed with many of the most important sites in Lisbon, so we made a beeline there on our first touring day. It was not too far from the municipal campsite where we were staying and we found out that it was almost the same price to take a taxi as it was to take the bus, so we rode in comfort. We actually usually enjoy buses, but taxi's are always a treat and the price was so low we could not resist and there was a taxi waiting.

We couldn't miss the cities [finest example of Manueline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jer%C3%B3nimos_Monastery) architecture, the extravagant [Mosteiro dos Jeronimos](http://www.mosteirojeronimos.pt/index_mosteiro.html) and the [welcoming](http://www.sacred-destinations.com/portugal/lisbon-mosteiro-dos-jeronimos-monastery.htm) formal gardens across the street. We also really enjoyed the gigantic  [Monument to the Discoveries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padr%C3%A3o_dos_Descobrimentos), Torres de Belem,  and [Maritime Museum](http://www.golisbon.com/sight-seeing/maritime-museum.html) ( Museu da Marinha). It was a gorgeous day which just added to the pleasures!

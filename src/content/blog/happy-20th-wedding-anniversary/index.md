The night before our 20th [wedding anniversary](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "wedding anniversary paris") in Barcelona, our 10 year old woke us up at four o'clock in the morning. We heard some odd rustling noise and she was adamant about closing our curtains that blocks off our bed from the rest of our small motorhome.  
  
This is a kid who had gone to bed at midnight ( our usual bed time this [summer in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "summer in Spain"))  and NEVER wakes or gets up in the middle of the night.We guessed something was up, but were just too tired to think about it, so we quickly all went back to sleep.  
  
What a sweet surprise to wake up to...this lovely large drawing and card to celebrate our 20th anniversary! Our 10 year old loves surprises and she had been working on this one for two weeks. She had made the drawing and card at the kids club here and kept it there until she just recently snuck it into a hidden spot in her cubby/bunk bed area. Even though I can not drink it now, I love it that she put a bottle of cava in the picture and made it a romantic candle light dinner.

After watching the outdoor movie here at our [beach  resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "barcelona beach resort"), she had gotten the scissors and tape at the ready for her planned late night mischeif. No it was not the [planned glamorous celebration](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/leaving-on-a-jet-plane-just-like-the-song-we-are-leaving-on-a-jet-plane-but-we.html "glamourous celebration budapest") that we had intended at the [Four Seasons in Budapest](http://www.fourseasons.com/budapest/ "four seasons budapest") followed by a few days at the budget gem [Downtown Oasis](http://www.downtownoasis.net/ "downtown oasis"). We will have to do that another time.  
  
I am just not well enough, so we had to cancel our trip and flight to Romania and Budapest. I didn't even feel up to going into Barcelona for a dinner and cava and most things are impossible for me to eat these days. Yet, it did turn out to be a very lovely and [relaxing anniversary](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/romantic-night.html "relaxing anniversary dubrovnik").

I took my daily hours- long swim, sauna, jacuzzi, steam room routine that makes me feel so good and later our dear friends who live near by,  joined us and brought some home made sushi ( a dish we taught them) and tortilla patatas ( a traditional Spanish dish that they are teaching us) and both things I can eat without trouble.  
  
My Spanish is horrible, but I so enjoy our relaxing time together laughing and conversing totally in Spanish under the trees and stars with these lovely people as our tweens dash in and out enjoying their freedom at the pools and nearby kids disco and entertainment or just giggling and walking about between bites. Being [enveloped in Spanish and Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "enveloped in Spanish and Spain") is music to my ears and balm for my soul.

My odd digestion problems seem to be getting better again, primarily due to acupuncture and herbs here as well as my daily spa routine and being mostly unplugged,  but it is a slow process. Looks like I will be totally ready to travel soon back to the US, but we will cut short some of our planned [USA road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "usa road trip") as getting me 100%  healthy is our primary goal.  
  
Despite it being much different than planned, funny how it was just perfect! Perhaps that is the best key for a long marriage, [good travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html "good travel tips")  and happy life...seeing perfection always before you and trusting it.  
  
"In marriage, each partner is to be an encourager rather than a critic, a forgiver rather than a collector of hurts, an enabler rather than a reformer" Oliver and Wright  
  
"Happy marriages begin when we marry the ones we love, and they blossom when we love the ones we marry" Mullen  
  
"I didn't marry you because you were perfect.  
I didn't even marry you because I loved you.  
I married you because you gave me a promise.  
That promise made up for your faults.  
And the promise I gave you made up for mine.  
Two imperfect people got married and it was the promise that made the marriage.  
And when our children were growing up, it wasn't a house that protected them; and it wasn't our love that protected them - it was that promise.  
Thorton Wilder  
  
"I think a man and a woman should choose each other for life, for the simple reason that a long life with all its accidents is barely enough time for a man and a woman to understand each other...To understand - is to love." Yeats

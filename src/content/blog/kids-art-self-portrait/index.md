 What do our kids self portraits say about them? I am not sure, but I got a big kick out of this one that our 11 year old recently did. I love the details of her [Mandarin School in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin school in Asia")'s uniform and her books including [physics in Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "physics in Mandarin") characters. The PET book is from her English as a second language class ( which is the top level and of course she is number one in that class and we're still trying to get her out of it).  
  
Even the socks must be regulation and has the name of the school on them and she didn't miss that detail. Sometimes I wonder how she feels as the only blond and [only America in the school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "only American in the Chinese school in Asia"), but she seems pretty happy and content. This now seems normal to her and them I guess.  
  
I love it that she is such a creative kid and am so enjoying more time with her this holiday where she is constantly creating in one way or another. Love kid's art too?

A math homeschool lesson in Roman numerals and Latin  in Nimes at the best preserved Roman temple in the world. We've really enjoyed our third journey this year [into Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/valley-of-the-f.html) and visiting the [Camargue,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html) discovering [Collioure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html) and loving the [kids club opportunities](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html). It's been fun comparing our visits to [Gordes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/going-to-gordes.html) and [Rousillon](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/roussillon-ochr.html) in the [Luberon](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/loving-luberon.html) to the new places we are finding this year in the [south of France.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/good-morning-pr.html)

[Nimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%AEmes) was a pleasant surprise and is totally different than Arles even though they are close to each other. The [municipal campground](http://www.camping-nimes.com/camping-nimes-en/camping-nimes-presentation.htm) is good, shady, cheap ( just 17 euros in high season and much less for a tent) with free wifi with good bus and train access to many places. 

Don't miss the famous [Roman coliseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_of_N%C3%AEmes), temple of Diane and other Roman ruins there.

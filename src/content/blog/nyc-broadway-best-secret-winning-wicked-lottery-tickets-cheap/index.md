Since we were in [NYC for Fashion Week](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/09/mozarts-adventures-during-new-york-fashion-week.html "New York Fashion Week with teen singer Mozart") with [Mozart as the youngest reporter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/09/mozart-is-youngest-reporter-at-new-york-fashion-week.html "Beautiful teen singer Mozart was youngest reporter at Fashion Week"), we didn't have too much spare time.  
  
Still, Mozart was dreaming about seeing Wicked since she loves some of the songs like _Defying Gravity_ and every time we go to New York or London, we see at least one show.

Luckily, I use to live in New York City for over a decade and still have a few connections to all good things in this city.  
  
[![Mozart at New York Fashion Week taking in Wicked](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e950e8970b.png "Mozart at New York Fashion Week taking in Wicked")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e950e8970b.png)  
  
My connection to all things theater, is reknown director and acting coach, Mary Lee Kellerman, who has been a dear friend for over 35 years.  
  
[![Teen singer Mozart and acting coach Mary Lee Kellerman](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e950eb970b.png "Teen singer Mozart and acting coach Mary Lee Kellerman")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e950eb970b.png)  
  
While we were having a long lunch with another old friend in another part of the city, MaryLee understood our tight time framework and worked out all the details for Wicked for us.  
  
[![Winning tickets to Wicked in NYC](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0735abf970c.png "Winning tickets to Wicked in NYC")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0735abf970c.png)  
  
So we just had to show up at the Theater between 5 and 6 to be eligible for the lottery.

Mozart was thrilled...  
  
[![Mozart in the crowd at Wicked waiting](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e95120970b.png "Mozart in the crowd at Wicked waiting")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e95120970b.png)  
  
..but the crowd and line was long. Still we thought we had a chance since there were four of us and each person can win two tickets.  
  
[![Happy Wicked lottery winners](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e9512b970b.png "Happy Wicked lottery winners")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e9512b970b.png)  
  
The crowd was quite jovial at the prospect of maybe winning this lottery and one fellow even asked if he could take a photo for us since he saw we were celebrating.  
  
After a wait that seemed forever( 60 minutes),the time to announce the winners finally arrived.  
  
[![I am stunned!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0735aff970c.png "I am stunned!")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0735aff970c.png)  
  
I literally gasped and wailed aloud in shock when my name was called FIRST! I could NOT believe it, but there I am standing where he told me, the very first in line to get the lottery tickets.  
  
[![cash money and Id needed at wicked lottery](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0735b12970c.png "cash money and Id needed at wicked lottery")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0735b12970c.png)  
  
It is an intense, quick, well organized scenario, once all the winners names are announced. You have to have your money in cash and I.D. ready or you forfeit. Only 30 dollars a piece!  
  
[![I won the Wicked lottery](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb078e7ec1970d.png "I won the Wicked lottery")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb078e7ec1970d.png)  
  
Then he gave me this button and we bought two tickets and had time to roam the city. We could have bought two more, but they were very expensive, so I gave mine to Mozart and her dad and chose to spend the time catching up with my old friend.  
  
It is a bit sad for all those who don't win, but definitely worth the try. Nothing to lose but an hour of waiting.

Manhattan is such a fabulous city to walk in, even at night and it was still packed with people and safe at Midnight when we left. As a model and actress when I lived in NYC, this area is where I often had bookings, auditions and jobs, so I know it well. We walked from 9th to 5th Avenue and back.  
  
Back in the day, this wild child would grab a bus while skating the streets of NYC for the thrill ride or ride my bike at 2;00 am after staying out late discussing acting, philosophy and who knows what.  
  
[![Times Square NYC](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e95168970b.png "Times Square NYC")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e95168970b.png)  
  
This city never really changes it seems, so when I return it feels like I never left. Mary Lee and I had dinner at Joe Allan's, a theater restaurant that has been around forever.  
  
[![Joe Allans ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb078e7ee3970d.png "Joe Allans ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb078e7ee3970d.png)  
  
It use to be one of our hang outs in our younger days, so the perfect spot to reminisce and catch up.  
  
[![Singer Mozart is spotted at Joe Allens](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e9518b970b.png "Singer Mozart is spotted at Joe Allens")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e9518b970b.png)  
  
They joined us after the show and were glowing, as we were from out time together.  
  
[![Mozart in NYC at night - feels right at home](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb078e7f06970d.png "Mozart in NYC at night - feels right at home")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb078e7f06970d.png)  
  
Then we hugged and said goodbye and went off into the night much enriched by time with dear friends, the massive, uplifting creativity of Wicked, the excitement of Fashion Week and the thrilling lights and energy of the Big Apple.

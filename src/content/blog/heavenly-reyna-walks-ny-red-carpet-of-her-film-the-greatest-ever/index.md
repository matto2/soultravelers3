"This movie is a great hit for families. I recommend buying not renting because the singing is so wonderful your kids will want to replay the movie over and over. The messages are uplifting and positive along with touching as a theme of living life before it is over is well developed in the story. For children dealing with loss and grief it will be a kind resource. Parents wanting to support their children's needs in finding activities and talents important to their growth in becoming an adult is also a theme and excels in being uplifting and encouraging to any child. Actually whether a child, teen, adult or elder this movie is 5 stars in addressing why you deserve to become who you are becoming, all parts, as time is precious with your family and friends and YOU deserve to be you. There are many other good messages. Buy it. You won't be disappointed when looking for a feel good, tender, family movie. Also be totally impressed with a good case of chills when you hear Heavenly Reyna's singing as grownup Rachel Waters."

But this was her first time visiting NYC as a single young solo female traveler! She had a blast visiting many of her favorite museums, seeing shows, visiting friends, shops, bookstores etc as well as walking the red carpet. She is a super talented photographer too, so enjoyed doing that as she roamed the streets and museums.

Next Stop for her movie "The Greatest Ever"... CANNES!! Their screening is May 16th at 1:30pm in Palais B. We are in Barcelona at the beach which is only about a five hour drive away. Should we bop over to France and the Cannes Festival to watch our daughter Heavenly Reyna on the big screen? Not sure if we can squeeze that in as we are busy [house hunting in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/07/americans-house-hunting-in-spain-home-buying-abroad-.html), but it a tempting idea! We bought it so maybe we will just watch it again on Amazon Prime. How about you?

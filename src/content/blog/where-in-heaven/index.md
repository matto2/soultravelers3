This is our little "Mozart" and she is 18 months into a multi year, open ended trip around the world, that started when she was five. She started playing the violin at 23 months old, so we thought it would be fun to mark her unique odyssey by playing her violin around the world at key places.  
This is the first installment, with the most exciting moment being her concert in the Sahara. She rode in on a camel and played for 60 Berber kids that have no running water and have never seen a violin.  
The beauty that we are seeing and the kindness of people every where, makes this world seem like heaven. This experience has been a great gift to us and we would like to share some of it with you. Enjoy!

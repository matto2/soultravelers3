What's better than a walk on a pristine white sand beach at sunset with sea gulls over head and cool ocean breezes? This was taken on our [Florida road trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "Florida road trip"), in Pensacola at the [Pensacola Beach Hilton](http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/PNSPEHF-Hilton-Pensacola-Beach-Gulf-Front-Florida/index.do "pensacola hilton beach ").

( Our daughter is now off for two weeks, having just finished her Mid-Terms here at her [Mandarin school in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "mandarin school in Penang"), so I am going to try to mostly do just photo posts during this time for the armchair travelers, so that we can have more family time. I know many of you are also busy with back to school preparations, so hopefully this will beÂ  good for all. )

I love it that the Jacaranda trees are in bloom and  peak season now as they always make me smile and we have some very near us. We're crazy busy with our take off duties, but our friend David sent this great article about where to [find Jacarandas in bloom in LA](https://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/news/obsessed-with-jacarandas-these-maps-show-every-single-purple-tree-in-l-a-052020)! Luckily, we have seen them in Spain, [Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/arriving-in-alg.html) and Australia too.   
![Morning Walks & Beautiful Flower Photos! soultravelers3 Bougainvillea ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330278807950c2200d.jpg)  
  
Bougainvillea also delight me and it loved our Med [home in Santa Cruz](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html), ( and we loved it) so if and when we buy a home in Spain, we will definitely be planting our favorite flowers and plants again.

Here, below,  is a photo I took in our [white village](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2017/09/back-to-the-most-beautiful-village-in-spain.html) as I walked it one morning in 2017, so I look forward to doing morning walks there too this Nov - Jan and sharing more with you about Andalucia & [Spain tips!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/10/what-to-do-in-spain-the-ultimate-checklist.html)

Who doesn't delight in a perfect peach rose?

Or a yellow one kissed by the morning sun?   
  
![Morning Walks & Beautiful Flower Photos! soultravelers3 yellow rose ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833027880795118200d.jpg)  
  
Climbing vines of Morning Glories are not as regal as roses, but they make me smile too and bring back childhood happy memories.

I am not sure what this white flower is, but I run into it a lot and it smells really good and seems to be a climbing vine too!

There are just too many magnificent flowers on my walks to share them all, but here are a few more:

I love the surprises too like discovering this tiny flower amongst some huge succulents.

Plus, sometimes I like a few fragrant lovelies  near me as I work at my desk as I dream about travel and all good things!

How about you? Do you like morning walks, spring time, flowers and dreaming about travel? Less than a week now, until I am in the air and on my way to Europe with new flowers and new places to discover.

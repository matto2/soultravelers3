Heavenly had a lot of fun with an amazing cast and crew. A special thanks to [Jeff Hare](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362799/ "Jeff Hare director"), the wonderful director, [Jeff Hardwick](http://www.jeffhardwickcasting.com/JeffHardwickCasting.com/Homepage.html "Jeff Hardwick casting director for Fame at a Deadly Cost") the casting director and [Ken Sanders](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006803/ "Ken Sanders producer of Fame at a Deadly Cost") who produced it.

Interestingly, this thriller is about the horrors of human trafficking which was the purpose of the [first song Heavenly released](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/12/mozarts-recording-her-beautiful-song-youre-not-alone.html "Heavenly Reyna song You're not alone about Human trafficking ") to be [in a movie](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/12/mozart-sings-youre-not-alone-on-the-radio-possibly-a-movie.html "Heavenly Reyna on the radio") when she was 13, called ["You're Not Alone"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/01/buy-mozarts-song-youre-not-alone-on-itunes-googleplay-or-amazon-.html "Heavenly Reyna song You're not alone")! [Demi Lovato](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/06/demi-lovato-dianna-de-la-garza-singing-and-mozarts-sat-score.html "Heavenly Reyna and Demi Lovato")'s sister Dallas said it gave her chills. Heavenly  has worked on many charity functions to support healing in this realm. With criminals  R Kelly and Jeffrey Epstein in the news, more awareness is helping this cause.   
  
It is doubly exciting that Heavenly got to sing five of her songs in this movie and we will soon release her songs "Damn Girl" and "Paper Tiger". Look for the watch party and release parties coming soon! Here are the acoustic versions of these songs with wonderful girl power and female empowerment themes!:  
  
**DAMN GIRL**

Heavenly also just booked the lead in a pilot this week with a writer/director who has a hit show on Nickelodeon, and is in the studio creating songs in English, Mandarin and Spanish, so 2020 is turning out to be her year! Best pilot season ever as she shot one already!

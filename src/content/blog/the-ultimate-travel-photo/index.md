Can one photo capture 7 years of [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "world travel") and [digital nomad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "how to be a digital nomad"), or [location independent living](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "location independent living")? I am not sure, but I like this one taken in our 45th country ( on 5 continents) and some how it conveys that for me. [Our travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "our travel lifestyle") in a nutshell.  
  
There is my [trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "how to raise a bilingual, trilingual or multilingual kid") daughter at just turned 12 in her [dragon year](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "dragon year in China") during her first [trip to China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-calling.html#more "travel to China"), about to pass through an arched doorway in the [Forbidden City](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "forbidden city") while able to fluently converse, [read and write well in Putonghua/Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "reading and writing in Mandarin") with the locals as we wander.  
  
Far ahead and passing through the first arched door in front of her is her father with his backpack on ( stuffed with 2 laptops) that he has been carrying since our [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "travel lifestyle with kids") began.  
  
I'm gimping along behind taking photos, so proud of both my beloveds as we amble and explore once again in a new place, learning and loving as we go.  
  
What do you think? Does it capture the [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") mood and lifestyle?

Planning a vacation or holiday in [Sydney](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/celebrating-13th-birthday-in-healthy-ways-at-four-seasons-hotel-sydney.html "sydney vacation")? Try this cheap, but exciting tip,( like the locals do) and take a ferry somewhere.  
  
It's pure, scenic joy to take a public ferry from Circular Quay to Taronga Zoo or Manly etc. that not only gives you the best view of the [Opera House,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/visiting-the-sydney-opera-house-must-see-australia-travel.html "sydney opera house") but a genuine feeling of what it is like to live in [Sydney](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/11/stunning-sydney-view.html#more "stunning sydney") and bask in this gorgeous harbor.  
  
[We met friends](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/mozart-meeting-soultravelers3-blog-readers-around-the-world.html "Mozart meeting soultravelers3 blog readers") that go to work every day via this ferry ( and interestingly read our blog often while on it during his daily commute).  
  
It's a cheaper alternative to a cruise on the harbor, but you still see the same great sights for much less.

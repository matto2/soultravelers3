Did you know that some popcorn can be dangerous to your health? It was listed recently,  as one of the [8 Alarmingly Unhealthy Snacks for Kids](http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/8-alarmingly-unhealthy-snacks-kids-201400865.html "8 unhealthy snacks for kids") and some say [microwave popcorn is toxic](http://www.naturalnews.com/034386_microwave_popcorn_diacetyl_lungs.html "popcorn is toxic") and can cause cancer.  
  
So what is a mom to do? Since we have been on this super [healthy food and travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html#more "healthy food and travel")  plan, we're always looking for great [healthy snacks for kids](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/healthy-snacks-for-kids.html "healthy snacks for kids")...(like for our fussy eater tween  and her teen age friends).  
  
Also movies are super cheap in [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang") and part of our [travel lifestyle in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Our travel lifestyle in Asia"),  but [popcorn at movies](http://healthfreedoms.org/2009/12/08/just-how-bad-for-you-is-movie-theater-popcorn/ "popcorn at movies bad for you") is a [healthy food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy food") nightmare. Movie DVD's are cheap to buy here too and we have a very comfortable couch and large flat screen TV, ( a rare treat for us)  so we like to go to the movies or watch them at home on weekends. ( We trade DVD's with neighbors). My kid wanted a snack and popcorn is the obvious one.  
  
So how do we get around the [dangerous GMO's](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/06/dangerous-toxins-from-gmo-foods.aspx "dangerous gmo's ") in popcorn, [horrible chemical](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/11/popcorn-toxic-chemical-di_n_388683.html "horrible chemicals in popcorn")s and bad fat that is in most popcorn that makes it so unhealthy?  
  
We do it the old fashion way! We've found organic popcorn here (labeled that they have no GMO's), use organic virgin coconut oil to cook it in, and use a [stainless steel pan](http://melisann.hubpages.com/hub/What-You-Need-To-Know-About-Corn "why use a stainless steel pan for popcorn"). We add Celtic sea salt from France and sometimes organic butter from grass-fed cows in New Zealand.  
  
How is that for easy, healthy, delicious  and international popcorn? Do you do popcorn?

Many people consider [coconut](http://www.westonaprice.org/know-your-fats/latest-studies-on-coconut-oil "health benefits of coconut") to be a [super food](http://www.naturalnews.com/029841_coconut_superfood.html "coconut super food"). When [Dr. Weston A. Price](http://www.westonaprice.org/ "dr weston price") studied traditional diets around the world, he found those who ate a diet based on fish and coconut were the healthiest. Dr. [Bruce Fife](Bruce%20Fife "http://www.coconutresearchcenter.org/")  is probably the word's best expert on coconut and it's health benefits.  
  
Recently, I've written about [how to make kefir](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "How to make kefir") and lots about [health and travel,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "health and travel")  our mostly  [organic diet](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic raw food and travel") and our [travel health secrets](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health secrets") and will continue in this area over time as we are learning so much.  
  
This is how we get our coconut milk and grated coconut here in [tropcial Penang, Malaysia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical Penang Malaysia"). I use the milk, shredded meat and dry some of the coconut to make coconut flour and also make coconut butter, coconut whipped cream and cream. The coconut milk and meat is made fresh for us as we watch and saves us the trouble of doing it all by ourselves by hand.

This is the nearby market in Tanjung Bunga, Malaysia. I've grown so fond of the word sounds here like Tanjung Bunga, which literaly means "flower cape" and is a seaside suburb of [Georgetown](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Georgetown, Malaysia stunning phtoos").

 Coconut is popular here in [Malaysia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "Malaysia travel") and a big part of the diet. There are even many bike-based coconut stands on many street corners selling fresh coconut milk made to order. Even our M.D. Pediatrician at the [Children's Hospital](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/penang-best-hospitals-great-health-care-at-low-cost.html "best hosptials in penang") here, suggested we use it for health. This is the market machine that chops the coconut meat into shredded coconut at the indoor/outdoor "wet" market in [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/penang-apartment-or-condo-rental-plenty-of-choices.html "Penang").

This is what the coconut milk looks like when I get it home and then I make it into kefir or use in smoothies or cooking. I usually use it fresh, but one can also freeze it for a week.  
  
![homemade dehydrator drying fresh shredded coconut for flour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330167692cca89970b.jpg)  
  
This is how we dry the raw shredded coconut on our dehydrator on our terrace that DaVinci made for free out of a discarded cardboard box and instructions on the internet via Google. ( I use it for many things making good use out of the tropical sun).  I then grind it into flour.  
  
Coconut flour and products are gluten free, very low carb, lowers the calorie count of food, promotes lipid oxidation ( burns fat), aids in digestive health, contains 40% dietary fiber and helps balance blood sugar levels. No wonder nutritional scientists and trans fat experts like [Dr. Mary Enig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_G._Enig "Mary Enig ") rave about the benefits of coconut.  
  
These are local foods, so extremely cheap, costing about 60 cents ( U.S. price) for 250 ml ( a little over 8 oz)  for the coconut milk ( size shown above) and $1.60 for 1/2 kilo for the fresh  shredded/grated coconut.  
  
Ironically, the organic virgin coconut oil, that we use for all our cooking and more, is imported from the USA ( so not particularly cheap) but made in the Philipines. We haven't found a local organic source for that yet, but are really happy with this wonderful resource since coconut is such a healthy food, we love it. Plus it really suits the palate in a tropical climate since there are endless delicious  things to make with it.  
  
Do you like coconut or local markets?

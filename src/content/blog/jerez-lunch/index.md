We had yet another fantastic lunch!  This one at the four star Palmera Plaza Grand Hotel and again we were the only people being served by a great staff. When we parked the van, we talked to the concierge and let them know we would be back for a late lunch after the horse show and Sherry Bodega tour. We were very impressed with the friendly, helpful staff.

I actually got the idea from Maribel’s Seville guide which I printed up and brought with me. I met her thru the Fodor’s website forums where they have lots of Spain fans full of lots of good information. She has superb information on Spain which you can find on her website: [http://maribelsguides.com](http://maribelsguides.com)

Again we were really hungry and tired and the experience was divine; a relaxed family meal with impeccable service, scrumptious food and sangria. Several of us  had some mouthwatering  pasta with shrimp, but we also enjoyed watching the serving of the bass served the Andalusian “Pescado a la Sal” way. It was baked in a hard casing of salt and every bone was removed in front of us which was entertaining.

With our stomachs full and content and our feet well rested we enjoyed being  enticed by Mozart into a game while we waited for desert and coffee. We had a lot of giggles as she started a word or phrase (both English and Spanish versions!) and we passed it around the table. Little moments like this made this three generation tour extra special for every participant.

The white chocolate and milk chocolate mousse dessert was just as melt-in-your-mouth good as it looked. We just ordered two of them and passed them around. Mmm, they managed to disappear quite quickly, one relished nibble at a time.

We only saw the highlights of Jerez, but were oh so glad that we had added this to the itinerary. It broke  
up the ride back to Marbella and we even had time to pick up a few groceries on our way back to the time share at Marbella’s huge U.K. style mall. We made most of our own breakfasts and light dinners for this group and splurged on some terrific lunches which happened to serve us well.

[Extended family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) can be thrilling when you run into other families doing  [round-the-world  (RTW)  trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) or [long term travel with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html) as we did with [RTW friends in Greece](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/06/rtw-meet-in-ath.html#more) and again near [Monaco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco) in [Nice, France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice,_France). We have also met up with some in [Austria](http://twicsy.com/i/Q5utb) and Sweden, but have yet to tell those stories. Because we do [slow international travel with long-stays](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) in [campgrounds in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html) or [long stay apartments](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html) and [rental homes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html?cid=6a00e5502a95078833012875d2b4a5970c), our daughter has [made so many friends while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html). Still, there is something special meeting up with other [RTW families](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/aroundtheworld-family-travel-digital-nomads-lifestyle-design-4-hour-workweek-international-vacations.html#more) and  and listening to the kids talk about their unique travel experiences and connecting is part of the fun.

Many Europeans [spend the winter at this campground in Nice](http://www.vieilleferme.com/) that has good wifi, a year round indoor pool, yummy fresh-baked croissants and French baguettes every morning and close to everything on the [Cote d'  Azur.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera) One of the other families we met there was from Denmark who had been doing [extended trave](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html)l for months and  they were on their way home.  Other kids would come and go, many on weekends as it was October and school was in session for most. Luckily, we [homeschool while we travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html).

 We also met  and spent quite a bit of time with this family from Australia doing a slow tour around Europe and had been traveling for many months. They had a girl just Mozart's age and they all had a ball together as  had a lot in common. In the top picture all of them are  enjoying a movie together outside one night next to our motorhome via Mozart's DVD player. We have lots of DVD's so this is a common treat on the road with friends & family that we all enjoy. The other photos are just free play time together near our campsite or in our [European motorhome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html).

Mozart of course, particularly liked the girl that was about her same age. Sometimes they would also play with the younger girl from Denmark even though she did not speak English or with her older brother and sister. Yes, we dressed up and went to tour sites [like Monaco](http://twitpic.com/h5i8) and even ran into this family by accident once while touring, but the free play around the campsite and in our motorhome, movies outside at night, swimming, biking, exploring together, making things out of nothing, talking and playing with others from different lands,  just being free kids is an important and valuable part of [long term travel with kids!](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html)

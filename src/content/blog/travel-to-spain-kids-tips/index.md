Our 12 year old American [trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "how to raise a bilingual, trilingual or multilingual kid") daughter just wrote a power point presentation for her [Chinese school in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Chinese school in Asia - american learning Mandarin") about [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/camping-spain.html "camping spain") and I thought you'd enjoy and learn from part of it and her kids tips and viewpoint as [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "barcelona and costa brava") and [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html "Andalusia semana santa") are [two of her homes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "homes around the world- raising kids as digital nomads") as we [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "RTW family travel the world") :_  

  
[Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/family-travel-spain-photo-andalusia.html "Spain travel") is a country known widely for it's [sunny beaches](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/yummy-beach-lun.html "beautiful beach spain andalusia costa del sol") and [amazing museums](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/prado-play.html "Amazing museums kids spain"), but that's not all_._ Spain has so many [beautiful white villages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html "beautiful white village spain") and so much history!  
  
[![Travel to Spain with kids - learning history through festivals in white village](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d408094a8970c.jpg "Travel to Spain with kids - learning history through festivals in white village")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d408094a8970c.jpg)  
  
For instance, did you know, that if you walk along the streets in [old villages in Andalucia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/a-thought-provo.html "wonderful tour in southern spain white village"), you will see on many doors, there will be knockers in the shape of hands, but you probably don't know why. It's because one day, a faithful wife was making “la cena” for her hardworking husband, when he came home with another woman! The wife plunged her hand into the soup pot in anguish where it was severely burned. Now the Fatima hand is a good luck omen if given as a gift.

Another wonderful attraction is the [Flamenco,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/flamenco-in-sev.html "Flamenco in Spain") one of the most popular dances in the world. Spain is  one of the most popular tourist destinations for the British, because unlike Britain, Spain has gorgeous weather all year long!

Spain  is known worldwide for it's immensely delicious cuisine. But believe it or not, probably the most popular food in Spain is “jamon”. Which means, ham. One of my very best friends once told me, “ no puedo vivir sin jamon”. That means, “ I can't live without ham”.( We don't eat ham or any pork).

The most popular Spanish food is [Paella](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "how to make paella in Spain"). I think our good friend from Valencia makes it the best. Paella is a  rice dish that originated in its modern form in the mid-19th century  in Valencia, Spain.  Valencian paella is made with white rice, meat (rabbit, chicken, duck), green vegetables,  butter beans and seasoning like saffron.

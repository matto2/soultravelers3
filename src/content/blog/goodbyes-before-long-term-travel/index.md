Our decade long [family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html) had us [saying goodbye](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/suite-bon-voyag.html) in Capitola area when Heavenly was five ( first location in our first youtube video,  ["Where in Heaven is Mozart"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4) that went viral much to our surprise).

Capitola is the oldest & one of the prettiest beach towns in California and where we did [California winter beach escapes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/california-winter-beach-escape-.html),  [enchanting halloween California style](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/enchanting-halloween-california-style-1.html), and [California Beach New Years Day](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/california-beach-new-years-day.html) because we returned every other year during our [world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html) & sometimes [home for the holidays](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/home-for-the-holidays.html). My mom sold sea shells at her shop there for twenty years, had a home on the beach and then one near the [famous Shadowbrook](https://www.shadowbrook-capitola.com) with a similar magical redwoods, river & ocean views ambiance.

It is a place that is dear to all of us and roots for [Heavenl](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com)y as she went to preschool, kindergarten and first grade schools in this area and we'd stay at my mom's for extended stays while on our world tour to spend time with family and friends. Heavenly also has roots in Barcelona, Andalucia, Penang, China, Texas, Los Angeles  and other places she grew up with extended stays, but Grandma was here and family, so we have special memories here.

I love this photo of Heavenly with her dad at Capitola beach at sunset after her first Thanksgiving dinner at Grandma's house nearby. I spent lots of time on this beach during my pregnancy with her, sat in labor here as it began and brought her to this beach when she was less than a week old to hear & imprint the healing ocean sounds. She played here a lot as a child.

Here we are with a 94 year old grandmother, 70 year old mom and 21 year old daughter/granddaughter. It was very windy, so my fine hair went crazy, but you can see we are happy to be together again. It was worth the six hour drive from our current homes in Los Angeles and Santa Monica.

Look at the big change from when we said good bye in 2006 to family when Heavenly was only five. So much has changed! We had to say [Goodbye to Dad & Grandpa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/good-bye-dad-grandpa-family-death-afar-while-traveling-abroad.html) while traveling, more [mourning while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html)  and most in this picture are now gone. So we are happier than ever that we took the time to travel long term, brought them along with some [3 generation world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html) in Asia, his [family arrived for 3 generation tours](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/family-arrives.html) of Spain together & we found a balance of staying [connected from a distance](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/-living-and-traveling-abroad-mail-from-home-thrills.html) via weekly Skype video calls & regular visits. [I've lost 110 lbs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/03/i-lost-100lbs-best-weight-loss-tips-.html#more), Heavenly is now a 21 year old adult with her own place & doing well [singing on Twitch,](http://twitch.tv/heavenly) shooting a pilot, won her 2nd Best Actress Award etc and unfortunately my mom has Alzheimer's disease, so does not know who we are. She is also quite frag ile physically and needs a walker, but her joy remains and she was happy to have an outing!  
  
[![Goodbyes Before Long Term Travel  soultravelers3 Heavenly Reyna ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330282e15026da200b.jpg "Goodbyes Before Long Term Travel  soultravelers3 Heavenly Reyna ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330282e15026da200b.jpg)  
We found a rental with an ocean view nearby ( and I will write a review soon) and it was good to have some family time together before we head off to [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/04/21-of-the-best-things-to-do-in-barcelona-in-2022.html) very soon for a long stay in Europe!

It was also sad because my mom has really already left the planet, although her body remains. She has been declining with dementia for years, but she got Covid before there were vaccinations and I witnessed through daily calls, how quickly that destroyed her brain entirely in a few days. Agonizing & helpless to watch that fast decline for me! Unlike many with Alzheimers ( like my sister in law wrote about in her book [Free Fall](https://www.amazon.com/FREE-FALL-BASED-STORY-REALITIES/dp/1734558482) about her husband's case), my mom remains joyful and has kept her playful sense of humor.   
  
[![Goodbyes Before Long Term Travel  soultravelers3 grandma](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833027880779b3b200d.jpg "Goodbyes Before Long Term Travel  soultravelers3 grandma")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833027880779b3b200d.jpg)  
Yet it is also bittersweet & heart wrenching to see her like this and knowing the highlight of her daily life is coloring books at the senior center, ( which I hear about over and over on the phone and in person now) something she would never ever like in her real mind. And how little she knew us or even much about her own life history or our times and history together. Sometimes it is even hard to find things to talk about now as her world is very small and limited. She can forget a conversation in an hour, so is mostly confused. but content.

She did really enjoy teasing banter with my husband Gar as that has always been their way to communicate and he kept teasing her and making her laugh. They talked about the Warriors as they both love them, but sadly my mom no longer understands the game or who the players are, yet she says she likes watching them as she always has.   
  
[![Goodbyes Before Long Term Travel  soultravelers3 senior parents](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330282e15035da200b.jpg "Goodbyes Before Long Term Travel  soultravelers3 senior parents")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330282e15035da200b.jpg)  
So we just found ways to enjoy and celebrate the good and being together in  a place we all love. Interestingly, my mom did remember that she thought she once lived in Capitola and enjoyed it.

Even though she does not remember us now or our history together, she had a great time and must have felt the love we have for her. It was good for her just to have an outing and adventure to see new things.   
  
[![Goodbyes Before Long Term Travel  soultravelers3 Heavenly Reyna and dad](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330282e1503689200b.jpg "Goodbyes Before Long Term Travel  soultravelers3 Heavenly Reyna and dad")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330282e1503689200b.jpg)  
  
It was also great for us to have some relaxed, bonding, vacation days with our daughter Heavenly as one of the scariest parts of this new long trip, is being a continent away from her as she is just 21 and new to being on her own, living alone  & involved in some choices that worry us. ( No biggie, just a normal twenty something). GenZ friends are great for companionship, but a bit like the blind leading the blind for life advice, lol. Yet we also trust that we have given her such a strong foundation that she will learn as she goes, ultimately make good choices ( even with any "mistakes" she might make) as we all do & it is how we grow. She is very smart, talented, hard working and capable, plus being fluent in Mandarin & Spanish will always give her great advantages. Empty nest & launching or "adulting"  are such an interesting and challenging part of parenting and growing up as we all learn new ways of being and shifting into a whole new perspective. It is quite a stretch for us to be so far from our "only kiddo" as we have always been so close, but it seems like now or never at our age. We can adventure and live much cheaper this way.   
  
[![Digital nomad work anywhere soultravelers3](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302788077bac7200d.jpg "Digital nomad work anywhere soultravelers3")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302788077bac7200d.jpg)  
  
We're grateful that Heavenly is so lucky, (especially as an artist), to be so financially independent so young ( as less that 24% of people her age are today). While we were out of town, she had a zoom "table reading" with the people from the cool pilot she booked! This remote work and virtual freedom today hopefully allows her to do some of her business from Europe when she visits us as her fans are also world wide. So having homes on 2 continents could be a big advantage and fun for her and all of us. Much of our communication with her is virtually anyway now, so shouldn't change too much, we will just miss the hugs, movie nights and weekly beach walks together.

They have been to her house a lot lately ( as we are storing a few things nearby) so have also been saying goodbye to her, but we will also all stay connected as we travel via Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime etc. and hopefully some visits in person in Spain.

We ended up having lunch in this spectacular location on a park bench.They had [Pizza My Heart](https://www.pizzamyheart.com) ( something Heavenly has been eating since Grandma use to take her there on the beach when she was 9 months old and running faster than anyone around, so once got lost at that age while Grandma was paying for it) so we joke about that remembrance and I ate my salad. The day before, we all had another long time favorite family meal that we've been eating since before Heavenly was born, from [ABC Chinese](https://www.abcscottsvalley.com)  ( the best Chinese food we have ever found around the world) & a MUST on every trip to this area. While my mom and I started with salad, they picked it up and we all enjoyed it at the beach condo outside with an ocean view.

We loved having the time together and being in a place we love. It was windy, but sunny and gorgeous as ever and brought back so many happy memories. Goodbyes are never easy, but a part of life. At my age, you never know when it will it will be the last time you see someone, as that happens a lot these days.   
Beautiful  friends and relatives, boom, gone. So cherish each day you have and all the love you have in your life. One reason we are traveling now is because we likely do not have that many travel years left for us, so want to do it while we still have our health. The 20-30 [defining decade](https://www.amazon.com/Defining-Decade-Your-Twenties-Matter-dp-1538754231/dp/1538754231/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) is huge for Heavenly, but so is the 70-80 decade for us. Hopefully, this world tour will go as successfully as our last long term family journey and thank God virtual connection now is so easy!

It will be fun to call my mom regularly like we did before and I think she will also adore getting postcards in the mail, even if she doesn't know who they are from, she will feel the love and our many prayers for her! I am grateful we said our goodbyes when her mind was stronger and I feel complete, but I will always miss her, yet the best of her lives permanently inside of me and never leaves. I am also so grateful that Heavenly had such a close relationship with her ( given our ages when she was born), thankful for the daily time together they had in her first 5 years, the weekly Skype calls during our travels and long stay visits in Capitola or her with us in Asia that helped them bond deeply.

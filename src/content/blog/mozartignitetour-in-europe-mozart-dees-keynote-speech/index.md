Traveling the world is something she knows a lot about as she has been to 48 countries on 5 continents, spending the last 10 years as a non-stop digital nomad and is already filling up her 3rd passport. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, Four Seasons, House of Blues, Six Flags and more ,but this is her first European tour.

After arriving in London, she will begin the tour with a performance on June 8th at the prestigious Baltic Centre of Contemporary Art, also a talk and concert at a large private school in Newcastle and then on June 9th being the youngest Keynote Speaker at the distinguished Tech on the Tyne Conference talking about her unique world schooling education and how growing up global has impacted her creativity, languages and career.   
  
[Mozart was a Keynote Speaker at the NAACE Conference](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/05/teen-singer-mozarts-speech-at-naace-conference-to-uk-educators.html "Mozart Dee Keynote Speaker NAACE") in 2015 and [Mozart Dee was asked to do a TED talk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2017/05/16-year-old-mozart-dees-ted-talk-keynote-speech-in-ukteen-actress-songwriter-singer-mozart-dee-was-asked-to-do-a-ted-talk.html "Mozart Dee TED talk ") last December in the UK by educators interested in her one-of-a-kind education.

Over 300 people will be attending this Conference so Mozart is very honored to have been invited. [Martin Bailey from Animate to Educate](http://www.animate2educate.co.uk/website/courses__conferences/78283 "Tech on Tyne Conference ") has created this magnificent event with some of the best speakers in the world on Primary Computing and Ed Tech.   
  
After the conference, Mozart will go to Edinburgh and then down to London for concert and speech.

The amazing Fuerte Hotel in Estapona is another one of the sponsors for the Mozart Ignite Tour and is near Marbella, Spain. If you look at the map above you can see what a long distance we will cover ( 2926 kilometers or 1818 miles) and most of it by train with a flight in and out of LHR.   
  
[![Fuerte Hotel Estapona ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb09a25db0970d.png "Fuerte Hotel Estapona ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb09a25db0970d.png)  
  
It's an area we know well as we wintered for many years in Spain and it is one of our homes. The prestigious [Andalucia.com](http://www.andalucia.com "andalucia.com") and popular paper [Sur in English](http://www.surinenglish.com "Sur in English ") will be doing articles about her concerts in Andalusia and will be honored guests.   
  
[![Spain's beautiful beaches in the Costa del Sol in Andalusia ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb09a29318970d.png "Spain's beautiful beaches in the Costa del Sol in Andalusia ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb09a29318970d.png)  
  
So it will be very exciting for Mozart to perform there in English and Spanish and on her guitar and keyboard on a stage set before a reflecting pool with the sea and palm trees in the distance. We'll live stream all the concerts and speeches as we can ( tech willing).

 We'll also be returning to Barcelona and performing at the seaside resort we have stayed at over 20 times, usually for long stays, so we have wonderful friends there.

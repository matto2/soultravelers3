OMG were they good to eat too and we have the recipe forever!  
  
I will be writing more about our amazing three night sponsored [Four Seasons](http://www.fourseasons.com/ "Four Seasons hotels") stay [in Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "Jordan family travel") soon, but couldn't resist sharing this photo.They couldn't have picked a better surprise for our daughter. Mozart loves to bake, but alas our travel lifestyle means that we rarely have an oven.

You might remember that last [Christmas in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/first-christmas-in-asia.html "christmas in asia") we had to make our cookies in a toaster oven just two at a time.  
  
This was a fun delight that we hadn't expected on our [Jordan travels](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "Jordan travels")! Have you ever done cooking with a chef on your travels?

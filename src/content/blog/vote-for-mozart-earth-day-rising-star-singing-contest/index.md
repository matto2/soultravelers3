**TALENTED SONGWRITER**  
  
Mozart loves [Earth Day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW-C2PGehYc "earth day kids great speech about environment and sustainability") and has a passion for sustainability and [Environmental Education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/environmental-education-world-school-kid.html "environmental education"), so also wrote a song for this competition in the songwriting contest....mixing two of her passions. Thankfully, you don't have to vote for that part as it will be picked by judges, but we could use your prayers and positive vibes!  
  
**THIS IS THE SONG TO VOTE FOR:

[Cape Vincent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_St._Vincent) in Portugal's Algarve is the furthest southwestern most point in Europe with a solitary lighthouse and dramatic windswept cliffs. We enjoyed exploring this beautiful barrenÂ  area. It is a national park and we read what we could about the [flora](http://www.bio.bris.ac.uk/research/plantrepro/algarve.html) and fauna ( it was in Portuguese), before DaVinci and Mozart headed to the lovely small beach at the bottom of the cliffs. The stairs down were very steep with no hand rails ( so typical Europe) so I gladly volunteered to watch the RV and let my vertigo pass on this adventure.

Later, Mozart played some violin near the [lighthouse](http://www.davesguide.com/f_c_s_v.htm) and even in this isolated area, there were a few vans who were set up to sell souvenirs to the small amount of tourists. We ended up buying a couple of small things and Mozart was happy to find another dolphin necklace as she lost the one we bought for her in [Istanbul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Bazaar,_Istanbul) last summer.

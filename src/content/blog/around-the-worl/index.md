Around the World with Phineas Frog  
Another fun geography puzzle book cleverly done in an entertaining fashion so kids do not even know that they are learning. Mozart loves this one and it adds to the places we have been as well as prepares her for places that we will go to. It is a skinny paperback, so great for our tight spaces too. Good for a round the world kid or any interested in geography or traveling the world.

There is so much to explore  
in Barcelona and the Costa Brava,  
but don't miss Montserrat

<!--more--> ![montserrat near Barcelona a Catalan UNESCO heritage site](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c323ffaae970b.jpg)  
  
There is so much to explore in [Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "barcelona travel") and the [Costa Brava](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/top-10-costa-brava-secret-gems-spain.html "costa brava travel tips and photos"), but don't miss Montserrat which is a UNESCO World Heritage site and has been a sacred spot since the 9th century. Montserrat literally means "jagged rocks" and the landscape as well as the  mountains are uniquely gorgeous.  
  
You will enjoy the picturesque [Catalan countryside](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/best-catalan-food-in-barcelona.html "cantalan countrside restaurant near barcelona") on this easy [day trip from Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/gaudis-sagrada.html "barcelona day trip Gaudi") which is close ( about an hours drive by car or train) but feels like another world.  
  
Over 3.2 million people make the pilgrimage to Montserrat every year to visit the Royal Basilica , a Benedictine Monastery, which houses the famous Black Madonna. Even for those not religious, Montserrat is a high point for nature lovers too  ( literally, as the highest peak is over 4000 feet high) because the views are spectacular and takes your breath away.  
  
We rented a car ( about 45 euros/day)  from our [luxury campsite in Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "luxury campsite barcelona"), but one can take a bus or train or even take a tour. We didn't take the cable car, but that is a thrilling option for some. ( I've got [vertigo](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/can-you-travel-with-fear-of-flying-vertigo-claustrophobia-and-agoraphobia.html "vertigo and travel"), so it wasn't for me). We parked in a car park right next to the Monastery which was handy.  
  
We went early in the morning to [miss the crowds](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html "how to avoids crowds when traveling "), and had it mostly to ourselves for a few hours of exploring the church grounds and hiking. If you go around noon, you have a good chance of catching the famous school for choir boys who sing at the Basilica. Montserrat is also a great starting point if you are going to add the [Costa Brava](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/dali-musee-hot.html "costa brava and dali museum") to a [trip to Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "trip to Barcelona on RTW tour").  
  
Have you been to Monserrat or is it on your list?

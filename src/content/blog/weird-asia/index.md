Is Asia a little weird?  
Sometimes it does feel  
like it's on another planet

Is [Asia a little weird](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/big-rats-in-asia.html "Asia weird big rats")? Sometimes it does feel like it's on another planet to those of us who are American or European. That's part of the enjoyment though of [life in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "life in Asia"). It's not all [typical Malaysian](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "typical Malaysia style") scenes though, or [Penang night markets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang night markets , hawker stands"), or [Karaoke singing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/singing-karaoke-in-asia.html "karaoke singing in Asia"), even modern shopping is different.  
  
One of the things that is a bit strange is just how much they love malls here. In [tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/tropical-christmas-abroad-in-asia.html "tropical Asia"), the huge malls are always crowded on the weekend, partly I suppose because they are air conditioned and the movies and goods are cheap. What's really odd is about 98% of the people shopping are Asian, the other 2% mostly Malay or Indian, yet about 98% of the advertisements use Caucasian models.  
  
I tend to hate malls, but even I have grown fond of our visits to the malls at least once a month, often times more, to see a movie. They usually have something going on like [car shows with a yellow Lamborghini](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/yellow-lamborghini.html "car show yellow Lamborghini") or this dance marathon for kids. ( Don't even get me started on the hospital or bathroom themed restaurants..that's coming).  
  
As the music blared and we watched this scene while shopping, peering down many floors, I thought, "yes, this is so Asia", as I  took a photo. [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/watching-the-super-bowl-in-asia-where-expats-watch-online-abroad-international.html "Asia super bowl") is sometimes  a bit surreal, but always entertaining.  
  
What have you found weird about Asia?

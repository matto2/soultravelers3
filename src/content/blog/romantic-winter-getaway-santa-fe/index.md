Looking for a sunny,  romantic winter getaway for [Valentine's Day](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/our-chocolate-valentine-in-kohn.html "Valentine's Day") or family spring break destination?  
  
On our recent [winter road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/road-trip-usa-best-of-the-west.html "winter road trip") through the [Southwest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/winter-road-trip-americas-southwest-.html "southwest winter road trip"), we once again fell in love with Santa Fe and all it's historic adobe architectural charms. We'd been to Santa Fe as a romantic summer vacation as a couple before our [world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "8 reasons for a trip around the world"), but bringing our [new teen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/11/australia-travel.html "teen birthday") for a family winter getaway to this amazing destination was brilliant too.

This was the sunrise view from our private, gorgeous, casita at [**Four Season’s Rancho Encantado Resort**](http://www.fourseasons.com/santafe/) who hosted us while we were there. This place is breathtaking and I will be writing more.

We also took an amazing hike with their [Adventure Partners](http://www.adventurepartners.com/define.html "adventure partners ") to the ancient Pueblo Native American Tsankawl Archaeological Site within Bandelier National Monument.

There we had a [homeschool family learning adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool and travel") discovering petroglyphs, ancient Pueblo dwellings originally inhabited in the 1400s and awesome views of the Sangre de Cristo and Jemez Mountains.

We soaked up local color and learned some history lessons with an entertaining walking tour of Santa Fe with our friends from Twitter, former concierge Billie Frank and hospitality veteran, Steve Collins who own the [Santa Fe Traveler](http://www.thesantafetraveler.com/default.html "santa fe traveler").

With a [trilingual kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "trilingual Mozart kid speaker") who is [fluent in Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning spanish in spain") and after all our years in [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "winter in spain"), it was a delight to observe how much Moorish and Spanish influence was in this cities beloved landmark, St. Francis Cathedral.

A big part of the charm of this magical city is the mix of three diverse cultures; the Pueblo Indians , the Spanish and the “Anglos”.  
  
![great food- Santa Fe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcb8fad3970b.png)  
  
Oh and the scrumptious food! We totally adored [Chef Andrew Cooper](http://press.fourseasons.com/santafe/hotel-team/andrew-cooper.html "chef andrew cooper") who is a master at healthy, sustainable real food that tastes out of this world.

The burnt sienna colored adobe [Pueblo Revival architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_Revival_Style_architecture "Pueblo revival style architecture santa fe") ,which is mandatory, gives Santa Fe it's unique, artistic look and feel. That alone melts my heart and it is a very walkable city with 300 days of sun a year.  
  
![Santa Fe Art Gallery](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d73fdf4970d.png)  
  
There are over 200 art galleries and handful of art museums in Santa Fe like this one on the famous Canyon Road with a traditional romantic kiva fireplace. "The City Different" has more artists than any American city its size.

The brilliant blue sky and stunning vistas will make your heart sing any time of day. This shot I snapped near sunset from a car window as the moon rose. Priceless.

We joyously made time to get together with old friend and author [Rebecca Skeele](http://makeitheaven.com/contact-rebecca/ "rebecca skeele") who has lived in Santa Fe for a long time and we last saw in [London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html "london travel"). The people are a big part of what makes this sacred place special as it seems to attract soulful types.  
  
As D.H. Lawrence said of New Mexico: "Touch the country, and you will never be the same again.”  
  
Is it on your bucket list?

[Family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is about discovering [ancient traditional crafts like lace work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lace) as we have in several places including in [Brugge](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/brugge-a-living.html) at the [Kancentrum (Lace Museum)](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/folk-lace-museu.html) and in [Galica](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/gorgeous-galici.html) , [](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/10/lace-pottery-in.html)[Spain in Camarinas, a lace making village](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/10/lace-pottery-in.html)  since the 16th century. It was also fun to discover the connection between the two. In this day of machinery made things, it is [exciting to see things made by hand](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/made-by-hand.html#more) with such exquisite attention to detail. We loved our time in [Brugge](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/heavenly-day-in.html) and [Belgium](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/brussels-mini-e.html#more),  but the [chocolate](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/chocolate-choco.html) and the lace will always stand out in our memories.

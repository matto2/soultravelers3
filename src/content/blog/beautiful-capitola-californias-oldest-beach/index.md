One of the most charming and family friendly beaches in California is also the oldest beach in the state and one of our fave places on the planet...Capitola! You can see the colorful and  iconic [Venetian Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Court "Venetian court") built in 1924 along with the wharf in this photo of Capitola beach. It was voted by [Sunset Magazine](http://www.sunset.com/travel/ocean-towns-00400000040124/ "capitola beach in sunset magazine") as one of the best beach locations on the California coast. It's popular with the elites of Silicon Valley as a weekend getaway because of proximity ( many who live here work in Silicon Valley).  
  
[Capitola-by-the-sea](http://www.capitolavillage.com/ "Capitola california") is actually the oldest seaside resort on the west coast and began in the 1850's. Long ago, I knew an elderly woman who lived in a house on this beach who had photos and stories of herself and family in old fashioned bathing costumes at the turn of the century playing on this beach.  Funnily, much of it looks the same today. My step father came here as a boy and young man and fell in love with the area as it is a quintessentially California beach town, but has an enchanting European feel to it   
  
He and my Mom had a house right on this beach for a long time, so I've been visiting this area for about 40 years. Mozart first came to this beach when she was 2 weeks old and has spent many hours over the years playing here. We started our first [viral travel video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4 "viral travel video around-the-world")  ( almost 2 million views!) and our [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family world trip") here 6 years ago and have have a photo of her at this beach at two months old in 2000.

So many happy memories, so it's been wonderful spending the last four months in this area. We've lucked out with almost all sunny days as it's been an excepional sunny and  dry winter. Alas, ( and happily)  it is time to go now...off to [tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical asia rental home") soon, but we will be back.

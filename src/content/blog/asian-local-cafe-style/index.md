What is the typical local lifestyle in Asia? This photo tells part of the story and I will be doing a whole series of photos that demonstrate [life in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "life in Asia") from [rickshaws in Georgetown](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/family-travel-asia-photo-georgetown-malaysia.html "rickshaws in Georgetown") to [typical Malaysia scenes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "typical Malaysia scene") to [Chinese New Year](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Chinese new year"), [temples](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwbU_OGfSQg "temples"), [singing karaoke](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/singing-karaoke-in-asia.html "singing karaoke in Asia"), [Chinese traditions](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/the-beauty-of-traditional-chinese-culture.html "Chinese traditions") and more to give you the flavor.Â  Even goats, cows and [rats](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/big-rats-in-asia.html "rats in Asia") in the city!  
  
DaVinci see these guys at this table every time he goes past this cafe, shaded from the sun and gabbing in Chinese. People are often seen eating noodles or Laksa with chopsticks and usually on plastic chairs or stools and carrying plastic bags from "wet" market shopping.  
  
Just another day in tropical Asia. What would you like to see?

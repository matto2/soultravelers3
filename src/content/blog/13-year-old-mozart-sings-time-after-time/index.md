**MOZART SINGS**  
  
We are so proud of [13 year old Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "travel teen Mozart speech") who just did her first [singing showcase](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "beautiful teen singer Mozart") which had an 80's theme so she sang _Time After Time._ She added curly hair, [fashionista](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/life-of-luxury.html "fashionista") clothes and Cyndi Lauper/Eva Cassidy dazzle to this award winning, classic Pop song.  
  
![Travel teen Mozart is singer, songwriter, musician and linguist](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d9db6ce970d.png)  
  
  
**BRAVE ARTIST** - **JUST 5 LESSONS**  
  
Many of you have been asking for this [singing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/tween-is-a-talented-singer-songwriter.html "Teen Mozart sings - talented songwriter ") video, so we decided to put it up, even though she has only had 5 voice lessons and is at the beginning of building this craft and art form. All voices do not reach maturity until one's 20's to 30's.  
  
**MOZART'S SINGING PERFORMANCE**  
  
Thankfully, her training in [violin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "violin around the world"), [piano](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/mozart-plays-mozart-and-more-violin-and-piano-performance.html "Mozart playing violin and piano") and advanced music theory ( even with our [RTW travel life)](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "RTW family travel ") helps support her passion for singing, but like most things with kids, it is a work in progress.  
  
**SHE HOPES YOU ENJOY THIS SONG!**

**SUPPORTING PASSIONS**  
  
As a [homeschooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling and travel")/[unschooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "unschool or homeschool gifted child ")/ [worldschooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school travel education") family, we are all about supporting her choices and following her lead and right now her biggest passions are singing, songwriting, [music](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/mozart-plays-mozart-and-more-violin-and-piano-performance.html "travel teen Mozart playing violin and piano performance"), dancing, [public speaking,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "public speaking") and acting.  
  
She has the added advantage that she can do this in [three fluent languages](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "3 fluent languages - trilingual speaking and reading") as her biggest goal is to [change the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/change-the-world-cambiar-el-mundo-%E6%94%B9%E5%8F%98%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-adorable-video-by-trilingual-mozart-.html "change the world with trilingual Mozart teen traveler and singer").  
  
**MOZART'S 4 OCTAVE RANGE**  
  
We've just learned that she has a 4 octave range which is very unusual for a 13 year old, or really anyone and certainly to her advantage.  
  
**WHAT IS NORMAL OCTAVE RANGE?**  
  
( Normally an untrained voice has a vocal range of about one and one-half octaves, while most trained singers have at least two usable octaves as training can expand a voice, though it is rare to have 4 usable octaves, especially this young).  
  
![Mozart travel teen and singer/songwriter and musician ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fce2ed6b970b.png)  
  
**VOCAL OCTAVE RANGES OF CURRENT SINGING STARS**  
  
To put it into perspective here are some vocal ranges for various singers: Britney Spears has 2 octaves, Madonna has 1 1/2 octaves, Alicia Keys 3 octaves, Jennifer Lopez has a 2 octave range, Kelly Clarkson has 3, Christina Aguilera has 4 etc.  Octave range is just one aspect of singing (ie Aretha Franklin has a 3 octive range and Whitney Houston 5, but both had amazing voices in their prime).  
  
**MY RANGE AND EXPERIENCE**  
  
Back in the day, I did some vocal training in NYC with an awesome coach who taught many stars on Broadway, so found out I have a 3 1/2 octave range. ( I didn't do it for singing, but to improve my speaking voice which needed to go from a Jackio-O-type-whisper...due to trauma... to my full capacities for stage acting.) Thus, I know first-hand the value of a great teacher when it comes to voice.  
  
  
![RTW Travel teen Mozart taking a selfie in the Tulips](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a51192a287970c.png)  
  
**WHY DALLAS?**  
  
Many of you wondered why we came to Dallas from Asia. According to a book I just happened to read, (about brain development and learning), the best teachers in the world for both singing and also classical violin, are in Dallas, thus it seemed like a logical next step to explore these opportunities. ( Actually, the strings musical school was in New York, but its primary violin teacher lives here).  
  
**EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES TO A TRAVEL LIFESTYLE**  
  
[Our travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "How-to longterm family travel lifestyle ") has always been led by Mozart's educational needs. We travel to places that enrich her whether that is [learning Spanish in Spain](http:/
/www.soultravelers3.com/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning spanish in spain"), making her [film debut](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/mozarts-film-de.html "Mozart's film debut ") in Croatia,  [learning Mandarin in China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/learning-mandarin-in-beijing-china-best-school.html "learning Mandarin in Beijing, China - best school"), exploring the [Grand Canyon](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/grand-canyon-family-adventure.html "grand canyon family adventure"), [Harry Potter's World](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-kids-review.html "Harry potter's world Universal kid review"), or [Santa Fe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/romantic-winter-getaway-santa-fe.html "santa fe romantic travel"), learning to [play the didgeridoo in Australia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/best-place-to-buy-a-didgeridoo-in-sydney-gifts-at-the-quay.html "playing didgeridoo in Sydney with Steven Tyler"), [swimming with dolphins in Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/02/only-place-in-europe-to-swim-with-dolphins-portugal.html "swim with dolphins ") or what ever can help enrich her and expand her consciousness.  
  
![Travel teen Mozart singing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fce2ee23970b.png)  
  
**FINDING MANDARIN AND SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES**  
  
There is also a Mandarin-speaking Chinese community here and a Spanish-speaking Hispanic community, so she can continue with her language development as well. She continues [teaching her 3 languages](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/best-classes-or-tutor-for-spanish-english-or-mandarin-in-penang.html "best tutor online for Mandarin or Spanish") onine and in person.  
  
**MOZART'S MANY WELL-ROUNDED INTERESTS HERE**  
  
Mozart has joined a Spanish-speaking Girl Scout troop here and is working on a STEM project for a badge with a University of Texas professor, has connected to an award-winning Mandarin-speaking violinist and conductor about joining a youth orchestra, is taking a songwriting class, [giving a travel speech](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/kid-world-citizens-inspiring-speech-at-global-education-conference.html "Teen travel expert Mozart youngest presenter at Global Education Conference") soon for the [Dallas Public  Libraries](http://dallaslibrary2.org/ "dallas public libraries"), dissected a fruit-fly larva in a chromosome experiment at the fabulous [Perot Museum of Nature and Science,](http://www.perotmuseum.org/ "the perot museum") is taking fencing, learned some science at [Dallas Arboretum](http://www.dallasarboretum.org/ "dallas Arboretum") etc.,....so she continues her well-rounded interests.  
  
![Mozart singing a POP classic](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d9db81d970d.png)  
  
**COMING OF AGE PROCESS FOR TEEN AND PARENTS**  
  
I am finding it fascinating that as our Mozart blossoms in her teen years, we parents are also going through a "coming of age" new phase as we try to figure out ways to support her and keep an open mind without any preconcieved ideas about her journey to adulthood, allowing and trusting her passions to lead the way.  
  
![Travel teen Mozart is a globetrotting  fashionista](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fce2edf3970b.png)  
  
**GIVING A TEEN MANY OPPORTUNITIES**  
  
As we have always done, we try to support her passions, give her many different opportunities to learn, grow and explore different ways of being. As non-singing, non-musical-instrument-playing parents, it's been an interesting and wild ride lately, but we are grateful we decided to take this risk and lean into the unique experiences available here.  
  
![Mozart singing a tender song](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a51192a35a970c.png)  
  
**FOREIGN OR NOT**  
  
As we excitedly plan our [homeschool family trip to Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/homeschool-family-european-tour.html "family trip to Europe and homeschool") soon, we also see that [exploring Dallas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/dallas-luxury-resort-arriving-to-big-d-in-style.html "exploring dallas family travel") and the opportunities here, has been as rewarding ( and sometimes overwhelming) as visiting any foreign country, as we adventure into these new waters of adolescence and the surprises they bring to all of us.  
  
**MORE KID THAN WOMAN**  
  
Despite the "big hair" look and mascara for performance, Mozart is still more kid than woman ( the clothes she wears are only 7/8 or 9/10 in kids sizes, though growing lightning fast now, over 5 foot and occasionally fitting into XS women's clothes). I find it is mind-blowing in some ways, as a mother, to see the babe I carried in my womb and breastfed, is now blossoming into womanhood.  
  
**BLOSSOMING TIME**  
  
It is almost as if she is turning into those [Uffitzi](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/the-uffitzi.html "Uffitzi with kids") Botticelli paintings she loved as a child like Birth of [Venus](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/hugging-aphrodi.html "venus or aphrodite") and Spring and I just stand back in awe at this whole process and pray we are making the highest choices with her.  
  
Perhaps it is because I am an older mom or because she is an "only", or maybe this is just normal for parenting a new teen in these fast moving "launching" years as they prepare for college and careers. I sometimes wonder how people do this with more than one.  
  
![travel teen Mozart exploring](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fce2ee98970b.png)  
  
**PERFECT SONG CHOICE**  
  
Out of all the 80's songs she had to pick from, I am glad she chose this one as it seems aprapos on so many levels. As parents we are always here for her and hope to teach her to listen to the Spirit within, her inner guidance... which will always catch her and wait for her and support her.  
  
If you're lost you can look--and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting  
Time after time  
  
![Travel teen Mozart singing and feeling the music](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fce2eecc970b.png)  
  
**MOZART'S UPCOMING PERFORMANCES AND SONGS**  
  
Mozart is working on a current hit, up-tempo, Pop song now for another "live" showcase in May at a popular music performance venue in Dallas, as well as writing new songs she will perform soon. She might peform in Mandarin too with the Chinese community here.  
  
**MANDARIN POP SONGS, POP AND CLASSIC PIE JESU**  
  
We hope to get her first paid singing gig ( at a large Chinese wedding in Asia - a Mandarin song), up soon on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "Soultravelers3 youtube channel") as well as _Pie Jesu_ that she sang at her recital at the International school in Asia and the Mandarin Pop song that she sang in her [Chinese High School in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Chinese high school in Asia - learning Mandarin") singing contest where she was the youngest finalist and won a trophy.  
  
**CREATIVE UNSCHOOL AND PARENTING QUESTIONS**  
  
What do you think about this new adventure? Have you found parenting and homeschool takes on new colors when your kids hit their teens? Any advice about supporting an artistic teen? How do you support kids in areas you know little about?  
  
**MOZART WON HER 1ST MUSIC AWARD!!**  
  
![Bronze performance award](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a51192d2e0970c.jpg)  
OMG! She just won an A&R Award for best performance on her first cover song!!

"Congratulations! You have [received a prestigious BEAT100 A&R Award.](http://www.beat100.com/watch-video/time-after-time---cyndi-lauper-cover-by-13-year-old-mozarti_117200/ "Mozart wins a music award!") BEAT100 only gives these awards to selected individuals for their exceptional achievement. Our music video awards targets musical talent directly ensuring that the most talented artists, bands or musicians are the most rewarded for uploading well-written original music or songs, for displaying a strong vocal/musical performance, or for uploading an overall high-quality and well produced video."  
  
Icing on the cake, eh?  
  
**COMMENTS FROM FACEBOOK**  
  
For some reason we get a LOT more comments and conversation on Facebook than here, but they disappear fast due to other posts,  so I am going to put them here for Mozart to keep forever:

[Maggie Robinson](https://www.facebook.com/maggie.foggin?fref=ufi) :)) I follow you guys and know there's no end to her talents, but as much as the languages and instruments can be mostly taught, the singing.. ( this is coming from a person who cracks bathroom mirrors when her voice fills the room..) the singing is a pure talent. It's great you guys realised is so early and that she wants to develop it

        [Jeanne Dee](https://www.facebook.com/soultravelers3?fref=ufi) Thanks so much [Jessica Larsson](https://www.facebook.com/jessica.larsson.75470)! Remember the photos we put up here [https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/.../mozart-beautiful-teen...](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html)?  
          
        So she JUST did this and we decided to put it up for all to see, even though she had only had 5 voice lessons, so is a work in progress as it takes a while to develop a voice from raw talent.  
          
        We didn't realize that she had a 4 octave range or was so precocious in singing until we had her evaluated here by top people in the world with voice and adolescent girls.  
          
        She has much to learn, but we already see improvement, so it was worth taking the risk of coming all this way. No one in Penang was at the level that she needed.  
          
        Surprisingly Dallas has one of the best voice teachers in the world and one of the best violin teachers. ....thus the main reason we came.

    I am writing a post now about this with more details. Youtube ( especially on a channel as big as ours) is a bit like sticking your neck out when one is just learning something...but we decided to put it up and show her work in progress.  
      
    Voices don't mature naturally until 16 ( or even into 30's for opera etc). but she has a big voice she wants to share and learn how to perfect step by step.

    [Jeanne Dee](https://www.facebook.com/soultravelers3?fref=ufi) Great to hear [Theresa Jay](https://www.facebook.com/theresa.jay.7334) from someone in the know! We are not singers, so that makes it a challenge sometimes to support her singing and musical talents...not to mention the travel.....but we do what we can.  
      
    We hear repeatedly from her teachers etc what great stage presence and charisma she has. ( Hard for us to tell since we are the parents ,so not objective at all lol).  
      
    Her greatest joy is to perform and is surprisingly comfortable on stage and is lucky not to have stage fright. She does get excited but when she is done, she wishes she had more to sing and wants to go back onstage! LOL  
      
    She will be happy when she gets to the point to do several songs and do a set!

            [Jeanne Dee](https://www.facebook.com/soultravelers3?fref=ufi) Aw, thanks [Lucinda Jenney](https://www.facebook.com/lucinda.jenney)! She is loving the opportunities here to perform, learn and grow.  
              
            She is off just now to her songwriting mentor...working on her "green" inspiring song for an Earth Day songwriting contest!  
              
            Loving how she gets to work on several of her passions at once!!  
              
            If she is a finalist, she gets to sing in front of 60.000 etc which excites and motivates her..... ( would make me hide under the bed!!) LOL  
              
            She is a tiny girl with big dreams...makes me smile at the boundless optimism of youth.

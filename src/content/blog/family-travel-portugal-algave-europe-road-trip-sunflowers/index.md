[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) on a [road trip around Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html) can mean seeing lots of flowers as you roam and we love seeing huge fields of sunflowers like these in Portugal. We've seen them in Spain, [Germany](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-germany-romantic-road.html), Turkey, Italy and other places. We have been to [Portuga](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/luscious-lisbon.html?cid=123313332)l twice on our world tour and enjoy our time there. The [Algarve](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/arriving-in-alg.html?cid=119736148) area is warm in winter and not far from Spain and the drive is pleasant.Â 

Do you love sunflowers too? Where have you seen them in your travels?

In a tiny 15th century village in Spain where Jews, Muslims and Christians lived side by side in peace for 800 years, our 8 year old watched America's first multi-cultural, mixed-race President's Inauguration. We watched it live from the BBC on our SkyTV right in our home here as fireworks exploded outside to emphasize this historic day that the Spanish press called "¡Una Nueva Era!".  
  
(The fireworks were for Saint Sebastian Day, but Spaniards were happy that Bush is out and Obama is in and so are we!). We don't think Obama is a perfect candidate and hope he listens some to Ron Paul and others. I don't think it is ever easy to be president and today may be the worse time in history, but some how Obama gives us hope and the world needs hope, now more than ever. We also need a uniter.  

We really never watch our TV here, but were so glad that we had it today. We feel our country has been badly hurt by the last eight years and hope to see a real change. Obama has a powerful image and voice and just that can be an instrument of change. It was a perfect day for a social studies lesson for Mozart!  
  
They do call Obama, America's first African American President and indeed he is that and that is a fantastic thing, but I think his multi-culturalism is more significant. I find it interesting that [many in his cabinent](http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-11-26/obamas-third-culture-team/ "article about TCK & diversity in Obama whitehouse") grew up overseas like he did, as studies show this kind of childhood tends to bring a different way of perceiving the world, so says [Ruth E. Van Reken](http://www.thedailybeast.com/author/ruth-e-van-reken/). These things interest me, because we are raising our child in such a manner by traveling the world on an open ended world tour.  
  
"According to a body of sociological literature devoted to children who spend a portion of their developmental years outside their “passport country,” the classic profile of a “TCK” is someone with a global perspective who is socially adaptable and intellectually flexible. He or she is quick to think outside the box and can appreciate and reconcile different points of view. Beyond whatever diversity in background or appearance a TCK may bring to the party, there is a [diversity of thought](http://hidden-diversity.blogspot.com/) as well."

We called home and talked with friends on [twitter](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3 "Soultravelers3 twitter profile & tweets") and felt very much part of this special day. I cried when [Aretha sang America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uswvLLtu0w "Aretha singing America at Obama Inaugural") and when [Perlman and Yoyo Ma and friends](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDUTM3NViHc "Perlman & Yoyo Ma play at Inauguration") played their sweet song demonstrating the many hues within our country, blessed with magnificent creativity. We felt so proud to be American and we pray for Obama, our country and the world as we all walk together though these tumultuous   times.

"America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace"  
President Barack Obama

Having spent many months with repeat [visits to Paris as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/paris-bois-de-b.html "visits to paris as a family"), I will have to do a [Paris family travel guide](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/paris-france-travel-guide-by-mozart.html "paris family travel guide") soon, but this photo says it all, doesn't it? What could be better on a beautiful summer day in Paris than renting a hand made boat and playing in a gorgeous park near the [Louvre](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/-family-travel-paris-france-louvre-photo.html "louvre ")?  It reminds me of a living painting.  
  
I've written many Paris stories about [Madeline, Linea & d'Orsay](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/madeline-linea.html "family trave paris Madeline, D'Orsay, Linea"), [Mozart's 6th at the Eiffel Tower](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "Mozart's 6th at the Eiffel Tower"),  doing [3 Museums in a day](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/3-museums-in-a.html "Paris 3 museums in a day")  and more like [Giverny - Monet's Garden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/giverny-monets.html "Giverny monet's garden day trip from Paris"), [Paris Chocolate & Arc de Triumph](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/sun-arc-de-triu.html "Paris chocolate arc de triumph"), and [Sacre Couer & Montmarte](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/sacre-coeur-mon.html#more "Paris with kids Sacre Coer & Montmarte")  from our first Parisien visit when our daughter was 5 and 6. 
  
As well as [finding wifi in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/free-wifi-travel-office-paris-digital-nomad-technomad-minimalist-workshift-mobile-work-on-the-road.html "finding wifi in Paris best place"), [celebrating in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "celebrating in Paris") and [Notre Dame](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/family-travel-paris-notre-dame-photo.html "Notre Dame") from our long Paris visit last summer when she was almost 10.  I love comparing our fist [family visit to Notre Dame](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/notre-dame-left.html "family visit to notre dame") with our recent one and found it so valuable to do repeat extended [visits to Paris with a child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/goodbye-paris.html "visits to paris with a child"). Just look through our France archive for more blog posts about [Paris and France](http://soultravelers3new.local/france/ "Paris and france").  
  
So many more stories and tips to tell about Paris and lovely photos and videos coming. What would you most like to know or see?

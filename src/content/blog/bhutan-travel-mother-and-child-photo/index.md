[Bhutan, the Dragon Kingdom](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/travel-to-bhutan-.html "Bhutan, the dragon kingdom"), sits high on the Eastern Himalayas, and is a place filled with prayer, dream- like outstanding beauty and with incredible, open hearted, compassionate people. The mothers and children especially touched our hearts, so it is wonderful that I am blessed to be celebrating Mother's Day in this enchanting place where family, love and protecting nature and tradition is so important. We met this woman and baby crossing a bridge and she graciously allowed us to take her photo.  
  
It's already late Sunday here in Paro, [Bhutan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan "Bhutan") and we have had another fabulous day exploring this country thanks to the lovely people at the [Tourism Council of Bhutan](http://www.tourism.gov.bt/ "Tourism council of Bhutan TCB") who are hosting us. I am already getting teary eyed at the thought of leaving this magical place and incredible people that we have met.  
  
Tomorrow we visit the iconic [Tiger's Nest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paro_Taktsang "Tiger's Nest") and tonight (and tomorrow) we luxurate in the magnificent 5 star eco friendly [Zhiwa Ling](http://www.zhiwaling.com/ "Zhiwa Ling Hotel")Â  Hotel. It's such a comfortable room that we are about to order some room service, watch a little TV ( with funny Indian commercials) and hit the sack.  
  
Happy Mother's Day to [my wonderful 83 year old Mothe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "travel with grandmother")r and to each and everyone of you!

[Alligator wrestling is an extreme sport](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7445009/Alligator-wrestling-puts-new-bite-into-extreme-sports.html "alligator wrestling") to say the least. I must admit this was scary to watch but also fascinating. For native American tribes like the Seminole, learning how to  capture and handle alligators was just part of normal life in the Everglades.  
  
Crazier than watching the crocodile eat a whole chicken in the air and eating crocodile meat in [Sydney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/the-stunning-sydney-harbour-yha-hostel-review.html "Sydney, Australia"), this guy risked his life and doesn't even get paid that much to do it ( less than $10 an hour). It was an exciting part of our [road trip to Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "road trip to florida") despite being a little nutty .  
  
I have to  say I hated the air boat ride here ( horrible and ruined our camera and shoes, but that is another story for another time), yet this part was surprisingly entertaining and educational. This [alligator wrestler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_wrestling "alligator wrestler ") was interested in the job because he was studying gators.  
  
If you are thinking about heading to [Florida for a getaway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/florida-sun-winter-getaway.html "florida getaway") for spring break, maybe look into some alligator wrestling and a sunset in [Key West](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/key-west-vacation.html "key west "). If you like travel on the wild side that is. What crazy things have you seen on your travels?

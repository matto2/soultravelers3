 We Soultravelers3 were voted one of the [Top Travel Bloggers of 2013](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/yea-soultravelers3-nominated-for-favorite-travel-blogger.html "top travel bloggers of 2013"). Wow! How cool is that? We are super honored and appreciate all the people who nominated and voted for us!! You rock!  
  
There are only  13 amazing bloggers on the list like my friends [Journeywoman](http://www.journeywoman.com/ "journeywoman"), [Camels and Chocolate](http://www.camelsandchocolate.com/ "camels and Chocolate"), [Conde Nast Travelers](http://www.cntraveler.com/ "conde nast traveler")' [Wendy Perrin](http://www.cntraveler.com/perrin-post "wendy perrin"),  and [National Geographi](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ "National Geographic")c's [Andrew Evan](http://digitalnomad.nationalgeographic.com/ "andrew Evan"), so the competition was stiff because there are soooo many travel bloggers and some with huge audiences from major travel publications.  
  
We give a big warm welcome to all you new readers who discovered us from [Christopher Elliott](http://www.elliott.org/blog/the-top-13-travel-bloggers-of-2013/ "Chris elliott")'s cool site where the contest took place. He is one of my favorite people in travel!  
  
In a nutshell, we are a [family that has been traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family traveling the world RTW") non-stop for the last seven plus years to 45 countries on 5 continents on just $23/day. We share inspiring ideas, photos, tips and [videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 youtube videos") about what we are learning along the way of our [ultimate travel adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate travel adventure")...  from [how to raise a multilingual kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "how to raise a multilingual kid") to how to eat [healthy while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "stay healthy while traveling") while keeping to a tiny budget.  
  
We've been so very blessed in our travels with things like winning  two [Lonely Planet Best Travel Blog Award](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/soultravelers3-won-2-lonely-planet-travel-awards-thank-you.html "lonely planet award for best travel blog soultravelers3")s, other [best travel blog award](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/omg-best-travel.html "best travel blog award")s, [interviewed in the New York Times](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html "soultravelers3 new york times interview"), on [BBC world wide TV about social media and travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "BBC interviews soultravelers3 on social media and travel"), on [Fox News about digital nomads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/soultravelers3-digital-nomad-family-on-fox-tv-.html "soultravelers3 on fox news about digital nomad travel"),  featured case studies  in [4 Hour Workweek](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/the-4hour-workweek-review-by-world-traveling-family-rich-global-digital-lifestyle-design.html "4 hour workweek review by travel family") , [The Art of NonConformity](http://chrisguillebeau.com/the-book/ "the art of non-conformity") and more without even trying, but these things still absolutely stun me as we are mostly unplugged these days.  
  
This one happened while we were busy [exploring  China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "exploring china") with little time for the internet, so it came as a total surprise out of the blue. Our blog is basically a labor of love, so this is very humbling and we so appreciate your support. We're very old for a travel blog, so have put a lot of energy into this blog over the years, so it's really sweet to be acknowledged by our readers.  
  
Thank you, thank you, thank you! You've touched our hearts deeply once again, so we send you all a great big cyber hug!

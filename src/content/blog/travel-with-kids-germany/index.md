Are you planning a family trip to Germany with kids? Most children will love the fairy tale atmosphere, beautiful countryside, lots of castles and palaces, medieval towns, fun museums, bike trails and more. The roads are great if you like to drive and the trains are said to be the most efficient in Euorpe, so getting around is easy.  
  
Aren't these storks adorable on this ancient half-timbered building? We saw this along the [Romantic Road](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/family-travel-photo-germany-romantic-road.html#more "Romantic Road"), one of our favorite areas of Germany. Our favorite town was [Rothenburg ob der Tauber](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/01/family-travel-photorothenberg-germany.html#more "Rothernburg ob der Tauber") although we also love nearby  [Heidleberg](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/family-travel-heidelberg-germany-.html#more "Heidelberg")  (  it is on the Castle Road).  These are some of the most touristed areas ( along with Neuschwanstein Castle) so my advice is don't see them in [high season summer,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html "traveling without crowds in high season summer") but like we did in the fall.  
  
Lubeck was another favorite ancient  city for us, a UNESCO Heritage Site and the home of Thomas Mann. Alas, I still haven't gotten around to writing about our trip there, but I will.  The fairy tale road is a fun idea for young kids where they can learn more about Hansel and Gretel, Cinderella, Pied Piper and Rumplestiltskin  
  
If you love Chocolate, don't miss [famous Chocolate Museum](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/02/our-chocolate-valentine-in-kohn.html#more "chocolate museum Kohn/Colgne, Germany") [(Schokolademuseum)](http://www.schokoladenmuseum.de/index_e.html "Schokolademuseum/chocolate museum website") in Kohn/Colgne, Germany  
  
Have your kids help you out with the planning and read books about it before you go, like [_Getting to know Germany and German_](http://www.alphabet-garten.com/store/index.php?app=ccp0&ns=prodshow&ref=B015399 "getting to know german and germany"), _Heide's Alp_, or _The Secret World of Hildegarde_.  
  
If you have been to Germany, what has been your favorite part? If you are planning to go what draws you the most?

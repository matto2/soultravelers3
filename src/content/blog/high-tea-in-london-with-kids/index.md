[Traveling to London with kids?](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/travel-kids-london-hamleys-toy-store.html "traveling to London with kids") You can't miss indulging them in a luxury high tea experience! Afternoon tea is a centuries-old tradition in London and most kids love the fancy service with flourish and scrumptious food, making them feel like real British Royalty or the upper class that they read about in books or see in movies.  
  
On our ongoing [family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "Around the world trip with kids"), our daughter has been to quite a few in many destinations ( including at the [Four Seasons Hotel in Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/amazing-family-fun-at-four-seasons-amman.html "four seasons hotel"))  and loves them, plus everyone should try to-die-for  [clotted cream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clotted_cream "clotted cream") and scones at least once in life.  
  
Whether you want a "proper" afternoon tea experience ( expensive) or just happily enjoying Brit-style sandwhiches, scones and tea in a less formal way ( cheaper) there are endless choices in London.  
  
We had an [amazing and very luxurious and fancy high tea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html "amazing, luxurious, delish high tea London") with old friends at the posh [Cliveden House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliveden "cliveden house, london"), but there are plenty of other choices. Here are a few:

No [trip to China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "trip to China") would be complete without exploring it's i[conic Great Wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China "great wall of china"), one of the 7 Wonders of the World and a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/438 "world heritage"). Perhaps this is even more true with [family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family travel") and [Mandarin immersion in Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "mandarin immersion in Beijing") with a child.  
  
The fantastic news about visiting the Great Wall of China  during-the-week and [off-season late fall](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "china fall off-season travel") is we had beautiful clear skies and ONLY two cars in the huge parking lot, so we had this amazing Great Wall pretty much to ourselves ( at the usually beautiful but very crowded [Juyongguan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juyongguan "Juyongguan") pass, known as the [Badaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badaling "Badaling").). Even the drive there and back from Beijing was a breeze.  
  
Kids love iconic sites and we did our [violin video](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "violin video").  We got to visit treated by our local friends who generously took off the day from work to drive us there and even got an unexpected camel ride like when [visiting Petra in Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "visiting Jordan petra") at 10 and the [Sahara in Morocco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html "Sahara desert camel ride kids Morocco") at 6.

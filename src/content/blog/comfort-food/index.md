There is nothing like fresh bread from the bread man dipped into home made soup to bring comfort on a winters day. It may be sunny & eternal spring on the terraces and outside, but it gets cold in this house so it feels like eternal winter inside to me. It is warm in the bedroom when we wake up (under loads of covers!) and I enjoy my hot shower, but the long wet hair, self-drying in the cold doesn’t help matters.

It is especially cold by my computer which is right by a large window. DaVinci wanted to take pictures of how I bundle up as I even wear a winter cap sometimes!  One day this past week there were some winds that seemed to come right through the window. I picked up Mozart from school and she and her friends in their T-shirts in the sun were teasing me about thinking it was cold. It does not seem to bother Mozart or her dad and they do not layer up like I do, but it makes me think soup!

Soups have a few purposes here, because something cooking on the stove heats up the main floor as these old walls are thick. I also have a fairly archaic stove with just two working burners so it is easy to just put on soup for a meal and slice up the fresh baked bread.

It happens that the bread man or (sometimes woman) stops right in front of our house, so buying fresh bread with our neighbors is easy to do. Mozart loves to pick wild flowers so we usually have fresh flowers on the table. I have never made so much soup as it seems I make one kind or another from scratch at least once a week.

We enjoy our dinner ritual; Grace, good food, conversation, working together  and often word games at the end. One or both of us head up with Mozart after the dishes to our warmed up bedroom for an hour of reading before brushing teeth, prayers and sleep. Usually we come down to do a little more computer work before heading to bed ourselves and just this week we have succumbed to using a heater in that room.

Like soup and wild flower bouquets, it is a simple and satisfying life here, even with my bundling up.

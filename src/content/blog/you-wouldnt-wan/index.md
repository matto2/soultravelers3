You Wouldn't Want to be a Roman Gladiator!  
This is another book that Mozart has had for a long  
time and reads over and over. She loves it and she  
loves Roman Gladiators for some reason. I would  
have guessed that this book would appeal more  
to boys, but not in our case. This is a funny and  
entertaining picture book, but filled with lots of  
interesting facts because the author is an archaeologist.  
We found it great to have with us any time we were  
touring ancient Roman ruins and it takes up little space.

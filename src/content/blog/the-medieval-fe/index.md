The Medieval Feast  
Another great book that we have had for a while and so glad that we brought it. Aliki is a fantastic author of unique, sophisticated nonfiction books for kids that have minutely detailed illustrations, and this is one of our favorites. It is a Reading Rainbow book recommended for 7 to 11 year olds and the entertaining story and sumptuous colors makes history come alive. Again, very portable skinny paperback for travel.

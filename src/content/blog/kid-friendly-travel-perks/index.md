Are there benefits to [family world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world travel")? Are there [educational perks](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "educational Kid-friendly travel perks") above and beyond all that is learned though experiencing d[ifferent cultures](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Penang different cultures"), [places](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/where-in-heaven.html "kid-friendly travel around the world"), [languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "raising a multilingual kid"), [history](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/pint-sized-pilg.html "kid-friendly history travel") and [transportation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/bus-on-ferry-to.html "kid-friendly travel transportation")? Does it [increase creativity](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html "travel and creativity") and adaptibility...two skills so needed in our coming world?  
  
After 6 years of non-stop travel to 44 countries on 5 continents with a child who grew from 5 to 11 years old while traveling, our answer is a resounding, "YES"! Perhaps, even our [minimalism world traveling lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "Minimalism world travel lifestyle") impacts as this photo demonstrates.  
  
[Best toys for travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/best-toys-for-travel-.html "best toys for travel")? Maybe the ones they make on their own! Free time, [nature](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/beautiful-butterfly-flowers-and-family-travel.html "nature and kids"), [art](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/mobile-mozart-a.html "art and travel") and imaginative play are very important parts of childhood that we hold sacred and encourage, as you can see in [Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/heavenly-holida.html "croatia"), [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/hanging-out-roa.html "Barcelona"), [Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/workyoutube-pla.html "portugal"), [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-play-date.html "Andalusia play") and [every place we've been.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "birthdays around the world")

Mozart likes to create her own worlds with her Lego and Playmobile toys, but she is also [very artistic](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/kids-art-creativity-travel-family-friendly-travel-education-homeschool-roadschool-.html "art and travel"), so makes her own toys out of paper, colored pencils, scissors and tape or glue. Above, in lead photo,Â  she holds a few she made while we were in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California"), but she has made a ton of these kind of things around the world.  
  
If she doesn't have something, she just makes her own. What better skill can one have?  
  
She hums away while she works which makes me smile as she has always done this since toddlerhood and it still charms me. It pleases me to have an industrious, self-motivated, creative kiddo who needs so little to make her happy.  
  
She just had a PJ party with two friends from her [Mandarin school in Asi](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "mandarin school in Asia")a over spring break, who have never seen playmobiles and they were particularly impressed with her hand made items, like her dvd player with tiny pull out drawer.  
  
Makes me wonder if she could sell them from an Esty store to the 7-12 tween market. What do you think?

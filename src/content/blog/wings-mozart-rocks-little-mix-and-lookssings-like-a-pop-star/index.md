"Amazing performance. She has the whole package" they remarked as [singer Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "singer mozart") left the huge stage of the [famous Gas Monkey,](http://gasmonkeybarngrill.com/ "gas monkey bar n grill stage") one of the hottest venues in Dallas, Texas where stars like Willie Nelson play nightly.  
  
( It's owned by TV star [Richard Rawlings](http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2013/september/interview-richard-rawlings-of-fast-n-loud "richard rawlings") of [Discovery Channel](http://www.discovery.com/ "disovery channel")'s hit show [Fast n' Loud](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/fast-n-loud "fast n loud show") [fame](http://www.gasmonkeygarage.com/ "gas monkey garage")).

**PROUD AND SHOCKED**  
  
As proud as we were of her and all the great compliments and audience reaction, I must admit we were all a bit shocked to see our 13 year old in make up and looking so much like a real pop sensation. [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/tween-is-a-talented-singer-songwriter.html "Mozart talented singer songwriter musician") was even shocked when she looked in the mirror.  
  
**BRAND NEW TO PERFORMING**  
  
This is only her third time on a professional stage and she had to put this together quickly, while also studying for her SAT test this Saturday. She had to wait several hours in the hot sun before going on. Thus through this trial and error of "doing" she is learning how to handle all the "pressure-cooker" aspects of performance and putting her self out there.  
  
**MAKE UP**  
  
I've got a whole story coming about the make up, done by the best in Dallas, the amazing [Terri Tomlinson.](http://territomlinson.com/ "terri tomlinson make up")  
  
[![Travel teen singer mozart sings at the Gas Monkey Bar n Grill in Dallas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73dd32571970d.png "Travel teen singer mozart sings at the Gas Monkey Bar n Grill in Dallas")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73dd32571970d.png)  
  
**CHILDHOOD MELTS INTO TEEN YEARS**  
  
One reader told me she felt some melancholy in watching this video because she would miss meeting Mozart as a young child. I can understand that melancholy. I feel her [childhood slipping through my fingers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/mother-daughter-bonding-tips-for-tweens.html "mother daughter bonding tips for teens") fast these days as she heads towards fourteen this fall.   
  
**LITTLE GIRL SIZE**  
  
Though I think when she runs up to get the trophy in the end ...you can see that she is still mostly kid. She weighs all of 78 pounds and still wearing little girl size 8 and 10, though growing like a weed now.  
  
[![Mozart travel teen sings, plays piano and violin and guitar ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd186c64970b.png "Mozart travel teen sings, plays piano and violin and guitar ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd186c64970b.png)  
  
  
**WOMAN IS EMERGING**  
  
Still, the woman is starting to emerge and it is exciting, frightening and inspiring all at once! I can see how our readers will feel some of this as well. Melancholy to see the childhood melting away, but thrilling to see the adult talents and personality emerging. Life is change!  
  
**MOZART'S BIG GOAL? CHANGE THE WORLD!**  
  

<iframe allowfullscreen src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MOM1LdMGsa0?rel=0" frameborder="0" height="480" width="640"></iframe>

  
  
This video was only done last December, five months ago and she seems about the same, so partly it is the make up that has an impact. I had no idea her eyes would take on a young Elizabeth Taylor look with eye make up!  
  
**MUSIC, ACTING, ART INSPIRATION**  
  
Her big goal is still about changing the world and spreading light through her music, speaking, acting and art. This is the time of her life when she learns her craft and all that it takes to become an artist and has many advantages through her [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool high school") freedom to lean into things and learn by doing.  
  
We believe the artist is a servant for humanity and one can minister through music and the arts.  
  
**PROLIFIC SONGWRITER**  
  
Mozart writes songs every day, did 30 last month, and writes them in 3 languages, so is focusing on many aspects of this art form. Our next singing video will be her doing an original song while [playing the piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr2e2nSYp3M "playing piano Mozart singer "). She also has performed Mandarin singing in Asia and in [Dallas Chinatown](https://twitter.com/soultravelers3/status/460509923760037889 "Dallas Chinatown") that we have to get up.  
  
**TRAVEL LIFESTYLE IMPACTS**  
  
Her [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "most well traveled child in the world") can't help but impact her music and global view point.

One long time reader said on Facebook:  
  
"Wasn't it just the day before yesterday when we were first seeing her play her violin?"  E.A.  
  
And linked this very first Youtube video of ours that went viral. Cute. Time flies when you are having fun!

**BABY WITH A PASSION FOR MUSIC**  
  
Mozart has always had a passion for music, really from birth. She even did a playful rhythmic game with me while in the womb where she poked back from the inside in a circle after I tapped my pregnant belly to her. She was absolutely mesmerized at 9 months old when she saw her first symphony and began [MusicTogether](http://www.musictogether.com/Home "music together classes for babies and children") classes at a few months old which she loved.  
  
**OPERA, SHAKESPEARE AND VIOLIN**  
  
She asked for opera at just a year old and probably has seen more opera and Shakespeare than any toddler/preschooler on record, all because we followed her lead. She begged for violin lessons ( because all the kids in our country neighborhood studied with Yale grad and [amazing teache](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/more-chocolate.html.%20 "chocolate violin ")r [Lisa Barca-Hall](http://barcahall.com/violin/ "lisa barca-hall")) and we got permission to start at just 21 months old because she was ready, an exception as most can't start until three.  
  
[![Mozart at 2 playing violin performance - eyes intent on teachers instructions](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511c7e0d9970c.png "Mozart at 2 playing violin performance - eyes intent on teachers instructions")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511c7e0d9970c.png)  
  
**PERFORMING AT TWO, MUSCIAL PRECOCITY**  
  
She was performing on stage at 2 with violin and absolutely loved it. We have a filmed version of her at four at a concer, we want to get on Youtube,  and you can see her glowing pride/joy in performance. She started piano lessons at 3 with a great teacher, performed dancing in Nutcracker at 3 and was allowed to start early [in Kindermusic classes](http://www.kindermusik.com/ "kindermusic classes") based on her advanced musical ability and reading. She started writing songs at four.  
  
So her musical precocity and interest should not be a surprise, but some how it is, because we have been more focused on langauge learning and travel, so didn't expect her passion for pop music. I did get a big "heads up" when she decided to j[oin the choir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyLHEuhdo2k "Mozart singing at 10 in Asia ") in her Chinese school in Asia and was asked to sing a solo in front of thousands at ten years old and when she was a singing competion finalist there at 12. 
  
  
[![Travel teen singer Mozart learning guitar ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd186cba970b.png "Travel teen singer Mozart learning guitar ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd186cba970b.png)  
  
**TRILINGUAL ADVANTAGES**  
  
Mozart  will likely be the first singer who can communicate to most of the planet in their native language as few Americans are fluent in Chinese and Spanish. These are growing markets and even hot POP singers today are [crossing over to Latin Billboard](http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/latin-awards/6053986/top-10-pop-stars-whove-crossed-over-to-latin "pop stars cross over to Latin billboard singing spanish").  
  
It is quite fascinating how many [Latino celebrities don't speak espanol](http://www.latinpost.com/articles/6842/20140204/naya-rivera-says-she-cant-speak-spanish-top-10-latino-celebrities-who-dont-speak-spanish.htm "latin celebrities don't speak spanish"), even those on the Latin Billboard charts like Jlo, Selena Gomez, Christina Aguilera, and how much more advantageous that would be for the singers to deeply connect.

**ATTACHMENT PARENTING AND GROWING TEEN BRAIN**  
  
We've long been passionate about Attachment parenting and think that principal is needed more than ever in the teen age years. We agree with renowned neuropsychiatrist Daniel Siegel that maintaining close connections and healthy attachments through the teen years is key since teens develop in the context of relationships.  
  
“the work of adolescence—the testing of boundaries, the passion to explore what is unknown and exciting—can set the stage for the development of core character traits that will enable adolescents to go on to lead great lives of adventure and purpose.” Daniel Siegel  
  
[![Mozart a talented singer, songwriter with star power](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd186d03970b.png "Mozart a talented singer, songwriter with star power")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd186d03970b.png)  
  
**TEEN AS TEACHER, SPEAKER, SINGER AND ENTREPRENEUR**  
  
Mozart is already an entrepreneur, [public speaker](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "public speaker mozart trilingual travel teen") and [language teacher](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/best-classes-or-tutor-for-spanish-english-or-mandarin-in-penang.html "language teacher teen Mozart best") and we believe in a child's  natural ability to teach themselves and design a personalized education program that is specific to the child or teen.  
  
She is interested in a duo track now of combining singing AND preparing for a top University like Harvard, Stanford, Yale, MIT, Oxford etc..Luckily now, she has met [amazing singer](http://www.youtube.com/user/MadisonGreerMusic "amazing singer madison Greer") 22 year old [Madison Greer](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/02/madison-greer-solo-artist-video/ "Madison Greer") who just graduated from Harvard, is a beautiful person and role model and sat next to us at the Gas Monkey show as one of the judges.  
  
"It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things." ~ Leonardo da Vinci  
  
Thus, the only way to get better at something is to dig in, make mistakes, and get as much experience as possible following one's bliss and passion, plus deep learning from master teachers with extensive  experience in their area of passion.  
  
Singing is an early peak kind of career ( especially for girls..if one is not singing opera)..so finding appropriate places for young talent to learn their craft, develop the talent and get experience performing is what this homeschooled child needs now to fufill her passion.  
  
We think it is very important to support a teens dreams as an artist and prepare for the real world.

**MOZART'S WORK ETHIC**  
  
"The artist is nothing without the gift, but the gift is nothing without work.” Zola  
  
Mozart has always been a hard working kid with a good work ethic. Our travel life demands that we have a high level of cooperation, flexibility and acceptance, so it has trained her and all of us well.

Many of us on planet earth have been going through lots of changes since last December and that is certainly true for us. The TV show has moved us into a whole new realm. We so appreciate your support and caring. I will leave you will these encouraging quotes from readers on Facebook where I posted the new video. So healing to have support when one is learning new things and taking new risks.  
  
**LOVE OUR READERS!!**  
  
Ohhhh Yeahhhh!!! Hang on Mom & Dad, you're in for a ride That girl has the talent, the looks, and she OWNED that stage!!! She is fearless and bound for stardom. I'd say get in touch with The Voice (my fav) and be there for auditions...remember Danielle Bradley? Mozart's next! - JF  
  
 I love the way she is obviously IN CHARGE of that stage and the song and her own charm and the audience . . .she has it all in her beautiful hands. I, for one, look forward to more!" - MS

How have you been supported in your talents? Do you think teens should take risks and follow their passions? Have you found raising a teen is a whole new paradigm in parenting?

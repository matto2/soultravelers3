Family travel sometimes means learning about one's cultural heritage through travel by walking or biking  the land and connecting with the people and the traditional ways. Mozart and I are part [Irish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/family-travel-photo-ireland-dingle-fusia-red-flower-green-landscape.html), so we really [enjoyed exploring](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-ireland-blarney-stone-castles-exploring-adventure-motorhome.html) all around [Ireland, summer](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-ireland-rock-of-cashel-st-pat.html) before last. ( Still have many photos and stories to share on that tour). We were surprised to find out  it is colder in Ireland in the summer than Spain in the winter, (which is also part of Mozart's heritage as she is a mongrel like most Americans).

In honor of [St. Patrick's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day), we thought we'd share this photo from the [Ring of Kerry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Kerry) in [Killarney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killarney) National [Park](http://homepage.eircom.net/%7Eknp/muckross/index.htm) where they have traditional farms and gardens at the 19th century [Muckross House](http://www.muckross-house.ie/) that is like an open air museum with natives reenacting the lifestyle. We loved it! This is one of the farmers who passed us by as we wandered the green fields and traditional farm houses.

That is how you say, "Happy St. Patrick's Day" in [Irish Gaelic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) and what we wish for all of you! Everybody is Irish today, after all. It's a warm, sunny, beach day here in Spain, but we remember the fun we had and celebrate with a bit of green!

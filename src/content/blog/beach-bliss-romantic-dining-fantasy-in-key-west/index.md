Yum! What could be more romatic than your own private beach with a hammock and a delicious meal served at your table just steps from the sea on the sand? And who says [family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel") or holidays can't be [romantic](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/romantic-night.html "romantic holiday with kids croatia") too?  
  
We loved this meal at the [Casa Marina Resort](http://www.casamarinaresort.com/ "casa marina resort") in [Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/key-west-vacation.html "key west") and now will recreate it in [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang"). We are now on a strict [healthy travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy travel") regime, so will have to hunt down the grass fed beef here and I have a great baker who can make the sour dough buns. I think I can make the dill pickles and [lacto-fermented ketchup and french fries](http://www.cheeseslave.com/lacto-fermented-ketchup-and-french-fries/ "lacto-fermented ketchup and french fries")! Drool!

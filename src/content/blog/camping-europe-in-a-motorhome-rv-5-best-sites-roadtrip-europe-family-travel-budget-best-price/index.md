[International family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) at it's best! One of the very best ways to [explore Europe is by camping](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/our-new-camper.html) and a motorhome, [campingvan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campervan) or RV is ideal for [family travel on a budget](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html#more). Few Americans seem to be aware of  how cheap and easy this is and what [a great way it is to meet Europeans](http://www.transitionsabroad.com/publications/magazine/0411/motor_homing_in_europe.shtml) and friends from around the world. Unlike American camping, it is not roughing it, but usually very luxurious despite the [very frugal price.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/arriving-in-alg.html#more)

Many are like 5 star resorts with every amenity from pools to restaurants to zoos and top of the line exercise rooms with saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzi's and often free wifi. There is not a city or site in Europe that does not have a campground near by and almost all of them also have rental cabins for those who don't have a motorhome, caravan or tent. Our lead photo is our RV in our campsite right on the beach  in beautiful Grisslehamn, Sweden and the view above is from our campsite in Barcelona.Some are as cheap as 8 euros a night and it's possible to camp for free in many places.

I will be doing more posts on camping in Europe and will be making an e-book with all the great places we have discovered and the secrets we have learned along the way about camping in Europe. Many people even spend the winter lux-camping in warm places like [Nice](http://twitpic.com/s9wb), [Portuga](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/beauty-and-nake.html#more)l and [Marbella](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/malaga-marbella.html). Yes, you can camp right in [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/paris-bois-de-b.html), [London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html), [Vienna](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/02/vienna-a-little.html), [Rome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/roma.html), [Prague](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/praguepraha-par.html), [Satorini](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=h23I_qsofiA) and more. There are sooo many amazing places that it's very hard to choose the top 5, but here are  5 favorites:

**Tuscany**

**[![Tuscany Camping Europe Beautiful 5 star Chianti Hills](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134805d2ae0970c.png "Tuscany Camping Europe Beautiful 5 star Chianti Hills")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134805d2ae0970c.png)  
  
**

This was my pick when the [UK Guardian asked us as a "travel guru"](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/jan/03/travel-gurus-2010-guide) what we suggested for family travel in 2010. This is an [ideal place to base in Chianti hills](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html), perfect for families and every age range. It's easy to get to Florence from here, ride horses, taste wine or discover the countryside from a lux base. The water parks here were big hits and quite addictive fun for the whole family.

**Bordeaux  
**

**[![Camping Europe France Bordeaux St Emilion wine country road trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133ed2cf4fa970b.jpg "Camping Europe France Bordeaux St Emilion wine country road trip")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133ed2cf4fa970b.jpg)

We loved this [charming place in St. Emilion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/biking-st-emilion-bordeaux-vineyards-in-france-wine-country.html),  the prettiest town in Bordeaux and surrounded by vineyards that are easy to bike even with kids! The ducks, tennis, two pools, playgrounds, lake, tennis & restaurant add to the special enchantment!

**Dubrovnik  
**

**[![Camping Europe Dubrovnik Family travel Croatia girl view wall](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134805d4570970c.png "Camping Europe Dubrovnik Family travel Croatia girl view wall")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330134805d4570970c.png)

 It feels like half of Italy moves here in August, but we still [loved this huge Dubrovnik resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/heavenly-holida.html#more) that included [beaches, pools, hotel, kid's clubs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/we-love-dubrovn.html) and anything you could want. This was Mozart's favorite, perhaps because of the daily free ice-cream parties and our large  campsite.We stayed a month, found it hard to leave and it clears out to few campers in September. Just a fun daytrip from [Montenegro](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/montenegrowho-k.html) too!

**Venice**

  **[![Family travel Venice camping Europe gondola violin mask soultravelers3](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133ed2d1acf970b.png "Family travel Venice camping Europe gondola violin mask soultravelers3")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133ed2d1acf970b.png)**

[Camping is actually the very best way to see Venice](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/italian-memoria.html#more) and most Europeans know this. They have beaches, pools, [every possible convenience](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/murano-glass-bl.html) and a lovely boat ride over to [St Marco's square](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/piazza-san-marc.html).There are a ton of 5 star camping resorts here to choose from.

**Barcelona**

**[![Family travel camping Barcelona holiday vacation get away pool ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133ed2d24a3970b.png "Family travel camping Barcelona holiday vacation get away pool ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133ed2d24a3970b.png)

We have been to this [Barcelona resort campsite](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html) 8 times since our world tour began in 2006, often [staying a month or more](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/hanging-out-roa.html), so you know [it is a favorite](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/bye-bye-barcelo.html#more) as it feels like one of our homes now. We even get our groceries delivered there and know many of the Northern Europeans who winter there year after year. It's easy to [take the ferry to Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-rome.html) nearby, is full of luxuries at bargain prices & best croissants in Europe!

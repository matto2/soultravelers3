Did you know that nourishing, delicious bone broths are one of the most [healing foods](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healing foods") one can eat? Bone broth is a super food and used by almost every culture through out history. To increase [health in travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "healthy travel"), or at home, I've found bone broths to be a key [travel health secret](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health secrets") and easy to do with [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel"). This recipe in yummy, full of amazing health benefits and I know the best way to make it easy!

"There is no such thing as a good chicken bouillon, and you should stoop to using canned chicken broth only during times of dire emergency." - Jeff Smith  
  
I was not very aware of bone broth benefits, until my [Santa Cruz acupuncturist Kathy Pouls](http://www.kpoulshealingarts.com/ "santa cruz acupuncturist kathy pouls") first told me about them last year and we have all been eating them regularly ever since. That and [homemade kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "homemade goat kefir and coconut kefir") have been my best food cures, so I eat them daily, To be a healing food, one must make it from scratch with the best ingredients the traditional way like your grandmothers or great grandmothers did.  
  
Most folks and even most restaurants do not make soup from scratch anymore, despite how easy it is. They use powdered or liquid flavorings loaded with  MSG, autolyzed yeast extract, hydrolyzed vegetable proteins and bad fats that are quite toxic to our nervous systems and brain.

In the GAPS diet protocol ( and many others) bone broths ( along with other super foods like [kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconut for kefir") and [fermented foods](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-salsa.html "fermented food like salsa"))  are the corner stone to "heal and seal" the gut lining which supports the immune system and cures many diseases.  
  
This versitile broth can be made ahead, then drunk as a beverage, used in cooking (like making soaked rice or as the liquid to steam veggies) and used as a base for stews, curries and many soups.  
  
Indeed, stock is everything in cooking. . . without it nothing can be done. ~ Auguste Escoffier

This is a slight variation of Brasco broth that Dr. Rubin and Dr. Brasco recommend in _Restoring Your Digestive Health_, but a common recipe that you can tweak to make it your own. The [mirepoix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix_%28cuisine%29 "mirepoix") is typical for bone broths for flavor and nutrients, but I don't usually use the zucchinis or garlic.  
  
Place cold filtered water in a large stainless steel pot, add the Perrier, apple cider vinegar, and let stand for 10 minutes or so. Add the chicken and chicken feet. Turn the heat on high, bring to a boil over high heat. and let boil for just 60 seconds, ( low heat makes the best bone broth),  skim off any foam and lower the heat.  
  
Add the coconut oil, vegetables. ginger, garlic and sea salt; and let simmer for 12 to 24 hours. Approximately 30 minutes from finishing, add the cut up organic parsley.

We get wonderful [DQ pastured chickens](http://www.dqcleanchicken.com/FAQ.html "DQ clean pastured chickens") here with feet attached ( far [superior nutritionally to conventional chickens](http://dqcleanchicken.com/DIFFERENCEBETWEENDQCHICKENANDOTHER3.html "superior nutrition of pastured chickens compared to conventional ") which have hormones, antibiotics and eat bad grain under stressful, crowded conditions).  I use to thaw them and cut up, but  I've learned the easy trick is to just use the whole frozen chicken, then after it slow cooks awhile, I take it out and cut it, separate the meat from the bones. I store the chicken meat in a mason jar in the fridge for several meals, break up the bones and put them in the broth to simmer more for many hours.  
  
I also often add the vegetables later and it is not uncommon for me to brew this mix for several days ( putting the pot in the fridge at night, then putting it back on the burner when I wake up). This can all be done in a crock pot, which I may invest in one of these days.  
  
You do not want to cook this in a pressure cooker as I've read that affects the nutrients in a negative way. Both Dr. Campbell-McBride and Sally Fallon say it is not a good idea as it makes it less nutritious. I am guessing partly from that high heat.

The most challenging part is when the soup is done, but it soon becomes an easy ritual if you do it once a week or like me several times a week.  
  
Remove the soup from the heat and discard the chicken feet. ( I still get grossed out by the feet, but they are a very important ingredient and particularly rich in gelatin). Remove chicken from bones and place the meat back into the soup ( or separate them as I do, explained above) and throw the bones away. You can ladel it into bowls and/or store some in mason jars that will keep for about a week in the refrigerator and months in the freezer.  
  
For the bone broth I store, I  use a strainer and pour into a smaller stainless steel pan, then use a funnel to pour into the mason jars. I pick out the carrots, parsley etc and put them in another jar. Then when I make a soup for lunch and dinner, I just combine these things and often cilantro, tumeric and maybe a poached pastured egg ( that I poach in the soup) if I don't have chicken. One can also add left over rice, sea weed, pasta, cabbage, sardines, coconut milk etc if you eat these things to make various quick soup combos from the broth.

I hope this inspires you to make your own bone broth and use it regularly in your kitchen. Any questions?

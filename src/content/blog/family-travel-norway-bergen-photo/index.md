Don't you love these cute houses? We really enjoyed our [budget travel to Norway,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/family-travel-norway-in-a-nutshell-norwegian-fijord-photo.html "budget travel to Norway") one of the most expensive countries in Europe. We loved the [Norway in a Nutshell tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/family-travel-photo-norway-in-a-nutshell-fijords-europe-roadtrip-budget-cheap-flam-train-vacation-.html#more "Norway in a nutshell tour") and saw a lot in a short time. Family travel can mean learning about architecture while visiting the [fabulous fjords](http://www.fjords.com/ "fabulous fjords") in [Norway.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-norway-oslo-vigeland-sculpture-park-mother-child.html "Norway")  
  
[Bergen was one of the delights ofÂ  our visit to Norway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-norway-bergen-fish-market-fresh-salmon.html "bergen, norway visit delights"). We loved the fish market, met interesting people, sampled beautiful traditional crafts like the warm, colorful sweaters and enjoyed a picnic near the sea across from these lovely buildings. Happy travel memories really are the best, aren't they?

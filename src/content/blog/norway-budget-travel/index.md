Can expensive, [beautiful Norway](http://www.visitnorway.com/ "travel to norway") be traveled to on a very low budget like ours? Absolutely! We've been [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "traveling the world") for going on 6 years now on just $23/day per person to 43 countries on 5 continents and that includes some of the world's most expensive destinations like [Norway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway "norway") and [Bora Bora](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora on a budget") on a very tight budget. If there is a will, there is always a way.  
  
[National Geographic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic "National Geographic") has listed the [Norwegian fjords](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/family-travel-photo-norway-in-a-nutshell-fijords-europe-roadtrip-budget-cheap-flam-train-vacation-.html#more "Norway fjords") as the world's top tourist attraction and they should not be missed. We loved the [Fjords](http://www.fjordnorway.com/en/), famous [Flam](http://www.visitflam.com/default.asp) and [Bergen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-norway-bergen-fish-market-fresh-salmon.html) Railway and breathtaking scenery while doing [Norway in a Nutshell](http://www.norwaynutshell.com/) on a [bargain budget](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html).  
  
The top secret to doing Norway cheaply is doing it quickly and much can be seen in a short amount of time. We stayed at a [campground in Oslo](http://www.virtualtourist.com/hotels/Europe/Norway/Oslo_Region/Oslo-214570/Hotels_and_Accommodations-Oslo-Bogstad_Camp_Turistsenter-BR-1.html "campground in oslo") and the fantastic bus, [train](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/12/bergensnanen-free-download/), and [ferry](http://gudvangen.com/) connections between [Oslo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-norway-oslo-vigeland-sculpture-park-mother-child.html#more "oslo travel") and  Norway's stunning, pristine fjord country make this [easy to do](http://www.ricksteves.com/plan/destinations/scan/fjords.htm).  
  
We also stayed at a [beautiful hostel in Norway's  fjord country](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/family-travel-norway-in-a-nutshell-norwegian-fijord-photo.html#more "best hostile in norway's fjord country") which was a treat for the whole family, including the organic food and sauna. There are cheap flight into Oslo from many places in Europe, but we had arrived after an extended [stay with friends in Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/funniest-kids-soultravelers3-family-travel-best-funny-youtube-global-kids-hilarious-sweden-trumpet-v.html "stay with friends in Sweden").  
  
Enjoy the many free things too while there like just wandering about, [Nobel Peace Prize location](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/noble-peace-prize-obama-soultravelers3-education-family-travel-adventure-kids-war-peace.html#more "nobel peace prize location"), [enchanting Bergen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/family-travel-norway-bergen-photo.html#more "enchanting Bergen norway"), tasting smoked whale at the [fish markets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-norway-bergen-fish-market-fresh-salmon.html#more "fish market bergen norway") and soaking in the beauty like Mozart is doing in the lead photo.  
  
September is a great time to go! Have you been or is Norway on your list?

We do a lot of walking in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang"), actually ,we [walk the whole world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/paris-for-families-walking-the-left-bank.html "we walk the whole world"), because we like to see this earth from ground level on [our travels.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "our family travels around the world") Here you see our 11 year old walking with her Dad, something they do regularly as we purposely do not have a car or motorbike here.

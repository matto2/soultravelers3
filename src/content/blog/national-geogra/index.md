Santa brought an early gift! I was quite surprised to get an email from National Geographic Traveler writer Emily King saying she liked our site and had blogged about us. [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/extras/blog/blog0612\_1.html](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/extras/blog/blog0612_1.html) Wow! It is a very cool sight and we are honored to be considered one of “the best family traveling blogs floating around in cyberspace”. So, now I am blogging about her blogging about us. (Grin.) I love the blogging world (even tho I am still  quite clueless).

I really enjoy hearing from others that enjoy the blog. We still have not figured out how to put comments right on the blog (as blogs really are suppose to be more interactive than this) so for now people must contact us thru our email at soultravelers3\[at\]hotmail\[dot\]com I heard from someone else new this weekend too who discovered it and is enjoying it. Please feel free to email me with any comments or suggestions. I love hearing from people. Many have asked for a comment part, I have not forgotten and it is on our list. After xmas we will get back to trying to fix the comments and RSS feed section of the blog so they work better.

But right now I am into xmas crunch like most of you are too. We went to the hypermarket & large mall that is about twenty minutes away on Saturday. We got our xmas tree for only 7 euros and it is very cute. We usually go cut down a tree at home and pay about sixty bucks, so a big difference. It is a live tree, but was not in soil, so we brought it home and planted it on the terrace for a few days to allow it to adjust a bit before we bring it in and decorate it. All our Christmas decorations are packed away (except Mozart’s stocking), so we bought a few bare minimum things to put on the tree and will make some. After xmas we will probably buy a few special ornaments to always remember our holidays spent in Europe.

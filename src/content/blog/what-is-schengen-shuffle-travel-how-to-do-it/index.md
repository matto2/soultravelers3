We enjoy taking our time and exploring places we've been before and discovering new places! We live a much freer, rewarding, luxurious  life this way at MUCH less cost than we did living in California apartment or home.

Looks like we started a trend in 2006 when we started as a family & now happy to join back in as an empty nester couple.

We bought our 1998 Ford Rimor  [van](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/our-new-camper.html) in 2005, so are very fond of it and have more than gotten our money's worth in this investment that we likely will pass on to our 22 year old daughter eventually. Won't it be wonderful if she can  explore Europe some day in it with her children like we did with her?

We like to shop locally and at farmers markets &  cook our own healthy food in our camper or airbnb, so we have become skilled at making the most of a small space! I actually really enjoy how it makes me a more mindful minimalist & is great for our health,  longevity & [my diet](http://soultravelers3new.local/weight-loss/). Here I am making a big salad for me and some bone broth for hubby. Every day is a picnic!

I love the indoor/outdoor living and  catching the sunrises if I can when I wake up like this beautiful one I put on Instagram on our first day back here. So much beauty makes me happy!!

IMHO, a camper van really is the best way to do slow travel in Europe......

Do you want to do the "Schengen shuffle" and a long stay in Europe? Many say it's best to use a [Schengen calculator](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/home/visa-calculator/calculator.htm?lang=en) ...Google for one. Most ( like Americans, Brits, Australians)  can stay for up to 90 days within 180 days but the calculations may be a bit tricky. Most go to a non Schengen country to wait until they can return ( like we did with nearby Bulgaria & Cyprus so still in Europe, but out of Schengen). Beautiful Morocco, Montenegro and Turkey are popular out-of-Schengen nearby, low cost locations that are popular with van lifers, digital nomads and world schoolers as they are easily drivable close, good internet & safe.

If you enter Spain on a 90 tourist visa/allowance, then you need to leave for another 90 days before you can come back.Tip: don't count 3 months as 90 days. Some months have 28, 30, 31 days and you can create problems for yourself. I type in Google "April 5 + 90 days" and it will give you the result. Generally we leave a 1-2 day buffer on the departure date...Just in case the flight is canceled or something. Google has heaps of info on this.

Now it has been one year for us doing the "Schengen Shuffle" and we still adore this lifestyle, so plan to continue it as we also look for a home and land to buy in Spain near Barcelona. We will likely continue this lifestyle even after we buy our home and will just use our new home as a base, but still travel lots, use our camper van to explore Europe and sometimes airbnbs.

Next winter Jan - April we might try going outside of Europe like Buenos Aires and Mexico for a warm winter and beach explorations. We might get a digital nomad visa. With the world's crazy financial crisis and other things, we are in no hurry to make final decisions yet, but have found some great home possibilities.

We're just all about enjoying our empty nest years of "new couplehood" & seeing as much of the world as we can while we are still young & healthy enough to enjoy it. How about you?

What is the [secret](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "secrets for health and travel") to making delicious, [easy, HEALTHY](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/page/3/ "healthy food tips") ice cream without a machine that is [GAPS/Paleo/WAPF](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic food GAPS diet, Weston Price ") legal and vegetarian?  Yummy [coconut milk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconut milk")! We've traded in our [healthy popsicles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-make-healthy-popsicles-.html#more "healthy popsicles") for this delight in several flavors.  
  
We are doing a [diet cavity cure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "cure cavities with diet") using [raw goat milk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/raw-milk-fast-and-cure.html "raw goat milk fast and cure"), [bone broth,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/how-to-make-nourishing-bone-broth-recipes-to-heal.html "bone broth") , [kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "raw goats milk kefir"),  [fermented salsa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-salsa.html "fermented salsa"), DIY sauerkraut, [mayo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/how-to-make-homemade-lacto-fermented-mayonnaise.html "easy fermented mayo"), [goat cheese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/how-to-make-diy-goat-cheese-with-kefir.html "goat cheese"), and much more, but doing NO grains at the moment due to their [phytic acid.](http://www.westonaprice.org/food-features/living-with-phytic-acid "phytic acid")  It is already working well and kiddo has also improved the whiteness of her teeth by several shades ( which surprised me!).

We are also doing no sugar and very small amount of fruit because of fructose, so we are not pigging out on this ice cream because it does have raw, unheated organic honey in it ( the only sweetener we eat and only small amounts), but it makes a perfect little snack when you are hankering for some healthy dessert on the weekend watching [American Idol](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/why-i-love-lazaro-arbos.html "American Idol - Lazaro") with the family.  
  
Finding [organic food in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/where-to-buy-organic-food-in-penang.html "organic food penang") can be much trickier than [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "California travel"), but luckily finding [coconut](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/awesome-asian-coconut-rickshaw-photo.html "coconut"), lemons  and [pastured eggs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raw-eggs-healthy-or-not.html "pastured eggs benefits") is super easy and cheap. We are [minimalists](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family"), so didn't want to buy an ice cream maker,but this can be made in one or not. It is less scoopable with out the machine, but tastes great.  
  
_“The research over four decades concerning coconut oil in the diet and heart disease is quite clear: coconut oil has been shown to be beneficial.”_ Dr. Mary Enig  
  
I make it in several flavors, but here is how to make DIY lemon ice cream.  
**  
  
RECIPE FOR LEMON ICE CREAM**  
  
**1 1/2 cup coconut milk**  
  
**3 pastured egg yolks**  
  
**1 TBL raw, unheated honey**  
  
**1/4 tsp sea salt**  
  
**Juice of 2 lemons**  
  
**Zest of 1/2 lemon ground ( optional )**  
  
**Whisk together then put in freezer til frozen.**  
  
_"Coconuts are nutrient rich. They are a good source of iron, phosphorus, zinc, and other minerals and vitamins. They are also a good source of protein and fiber, while containing few naturally occurring sugars."_ Ray Sahelian M.D.  
  
Enjoy!

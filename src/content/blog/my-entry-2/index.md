May your year be filled [with blessings](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-morton/lost-everything-found-the_b_154513.html "Inspiring article about blessings even to those who feel all is lost")! I find this a reflective [time of year](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-mannino/6-steps-to-being-less-ove_b_154570.html "6 steps to being less overwhelmed in 2009") and wanted to thank all of our readers for supporting Soultravelers3 and our family travel.  As  we enter into our third year of around-the-world travel, we continue to be amazed by [this life of freedom](http://www.techworld.com.au/article/268463/why_downturn_can_good_digital_nomads?pp=2 "why this recession will be good for digital nomads") and the beauty we find everywhere.

We did not really expect all the connection that we have had through web2.0 when we started our trip.In some ways it seems like we are traveling the web20 world as we explore the real world. So many wonderful people have come into our lives through this medium and it allows us to stay connected to old friends. Thank you. I can not tell you how much it enriches our journey and touches us. The world is getting smaller!

We usually do a [Christmas letter](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/holiday-letter.html "Our 2007 Christmas letter")  online, but since we just went home for a visit and are still trying to catch up, we thought we would do a bit of a year review now. It is a quick look back and also seeing what is coming up.

It was an exciting year for us and I still have much to share about it in greater detail. We headed off from our winter Spain with a [bang we did not expect.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/05/dentists-travel.html#more "dentists & travel") We loved discovering Portugal this year and northern Spain. We ended up driving a lot more this year on our ambitious plan. That part was a little exhausting, so we will definitely be doing more slow travel this year.

We loved seeing more of France that we had not been to. People tend to just see the highlights of Europe, but we are grateful that we get to see so much by driving the land. They are much bigger countries than most Americans realize,  with so much to see everywhere. I could spend ten years in just Spain or France and barely make a dent. [Bordeaux](http://www.bordeaux-tourisme.com/index_uk.html "Tourism info on Bordeaux") and the [Dordogne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dordogne "wikipedia on Dordogne")  were highlights for us, as was [Puy Du Foy.](http://www.puydufou.com/uk/ "Amazing French amusement park")

A less fun moment was when our RV got rear-ended on our way to catch the ferry from France to Ireland. We are still dealing with that one, but also even had blessings involved with that which we will go into in  a post soon.

The British Isles were mostly cold in July and August, but we managed to find a few sunny days and had lots of fun in Ireland, Wales, [England](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSB7Gictlag&feature=channel_page "Mozart flies with Harry Potter at Hogwarts!") and finishing with the famous Fringe Festival in [beautiful Edinburgh,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-jwBGqJ9zY&feature=channel_page "Mozart in Scotland in her kilt!") Scotland. We will be getting those stories, pictures and lots of videos up soon.

Sweden became one of our favorite countries, thanks mostly  to our ultra-generous friends who provided us with a [cute red cottage](http://twitpic.com/8ahu "Red Swedish cottage & sunflower") and spoiled us to death,  while they [immersed us](http://twitpic.com/85rf "Yummy Swedish tradition") in the culture. These were friends we met on the internet who were even more delightful in person. We did not want to leave, but also enjoyed the spectacular fjords of Norway, lots of charming Denmark including the original Legoland and a yummy taste of Finland.

We had lots of fun surprises in Germany and particularly enjoyed the [Romantic Road](http://twitpic.com/gqyv "Sunflowers & autumn leaves on Romantic Road"), before we were back into France and exploring Colmar, the [Alsace wine region](http://twitpic.com/grje "Amazing colors at harvest!") at harvest time & a quick dip into Switzerland. We rested on the Cote d'Azure where we met a great traveling family from Oz with 3 kids for Mozart to play with and "talk shop" about the roaming life, then we saw [Monoco](http://twitpic.com/h5i8 "Mozart in Monoco!").

Next, we had a mad dash down to Barcelona for another rest, then deeper south to Marbella. Our loving friends in Malaga nurtured us and watched our RV while we jetted off to Madrid, then onto NYC where we visited thousands of school kids that follow us virtually through [Reach The World](http://www.reachtheworld.org/journey/journeytoeurope "Reach The World"). We met them in Harlem, Bronx, Queens and Lower East Side, did our first power point presentations, then fell in love with them all plus the great teachers and principals that support them.

We had the [best Halloween of our lives](http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/blogs/perrinpost/2008/11/a-halloween-wit.html "Conde Nast Perrin Post on our Halloween") thanks to our generous online buddy Wendy Perrin from [Conde Nast Traveler](http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler "CNT website") and her fabulous travel loving family. Then we were off on another jet to see family and friends  in California which was a rare and wonderful treat after being gone for  2 1/2 years. We had two Thanksgiving dinners, stuffed ourselves with favorite food, hugged family members like there was no tomorrow and bought a few things.

Another two jets to Utah, then Denver where we met the most wonderful family at the famous [Castle Marne B&B](http://www.castlemarne.com/ "Castle Marne B&B website") where they spoiled us in every way. Mozart met her match with their daughter and even did a sleep over!

We had to rush back to San Jose, then onto NYC again for a day and then to Paris and onto Malaga. So many people complain about planes, but we ended up with all good flights and it went like clockwork, partly because we traveled with just a [small daypack each](http://twitpic.com/obtr "daypacks in airport"), despite needing 3 seasons of clothes.

We love being back in "our" village and it has been exceptionally sunny. Today was the 3 Kings festival and we enjoy that tradition very much. We enjoyed just hanging out together for Christmas and simple pleasures like reading or watching dvd's together snuggled in bed.

Like many of you, we sense a change in the air with 2006. We are trying to learn new ways of doing things like this talking video and plan to start some podcasts on itunes. We are going to be getting up lots of new videos soon, so make sure that you are subscribed to [our Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "Soultravelers3 Youtube Channel..Subscribe!") where they show up first! If you are not subscribed to our blog, please make sure you do that in the upper right hand corner.

DaVinci will also be working on organizing our photos in Flickr and I think I am going to start a photo a day post of random photos. That will give you some fun travel thrills and give me time to do other writing assignments in between these longer  posts. We are still trying to learn the fine art of how to travel and blog all that we are seeing and learning.

Sometimes [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel") and a [family friendly vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family friendly vacation international") with young kids is all  about the animals that you see along the way. As we walked  by this lush green farmland not far from [Killarney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killarney) on the [Ring of Kerry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Kerry), we spotted this sweet scene of a mama donkey feeding her baby.  
  
Our 10 year old [daughter Mozart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4 "mozart around the world"), still squeals with delight when she sees any baby animal and since she was a [long term breast fed baby](http://crunchydomesticgoddess.com/2009/01/02/breastfeeding-until-age-3-4-or-5-more-common-than-you-think/ "long term breastfeeding")  that did [child led weaning](http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/norma_jane_bumgarner2.html "child led weaning"), who will always remember nursing, she seems especially touched by feeding animal babies.  
  
Mozart and I are part [Irish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/family-travel-photo-ireland-dingle-fusia-red-flower-green-landscape.html), and DaVinci relates to the culture, so we really [enjoyed exploring](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-ireland-blarney-stone-castles-exploring-adventure-motorhome.html) all around [Ireland](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-ireland-rock-of-cashel-st-pat.html) especially the country side delights.  
  
Have you been to [Ireland](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/family-travel-ireland-photo-gaelic-colors.html "ireland vacation")? What are some of your favorite memories?

Wow! At just 14, [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2016/03/mozart-sings-her-original-song-dear-heart-official-music-video.html "Mozart sings \"Dear Heart\"")  starred as the dramatic lead in a film called "Rose" shot last summer and just won the Best Actress Award at the prestigious Bare Bones International Film Festival!! To add to that joy, she is [singing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/02/teen-mozart-singing-red-carpet-grammys.html "Mozart singing teen pop singer") next week at Carnegie Hall in New York City.

**MOZART DEE STARS AS ROSE IN FILM**  
In the film, [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "travel kid expert") plays a teen age [violin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "kid playing violin around the world") prodigy named Rose, who dies of cancer and finds out she is adopted, so a meaty, dramatic role for her first film. It is a very challenging role even for the most seasoned professional actress, so a lot to take on as a first film.  You can see a few minutes peek of her film in [Mozart's Acting Demo Reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v3HrE1kFp8 " Mozart's Acting Demo Reel"):

**THE RENOWNED BARE BONES INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL**   
  
The Bare Bones Festival was named by PBS as one of the "top 20 documentary film festivals" and by MovieMaker Magazine as one of the "25 Festivals worth the entry fee" and one of the "20 best festivals for new and emerging filmmakers.

[Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "Mozart beautiful teen singer, actress, songwriter") is in quite esteemed company as Malcolm McDowell ( 2015), Eric Roberts ( 2013), Jane Seymore ( 2015) and other greats have all been nominated for Best Actor or Actress at the Bare Bones Festival. So this award with be an awesome addition to [Mozart Dee's  IMBD page](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7413363/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm "Mozart Dee IMBD") ( which we haven't started yet).

Here is a little video we made about making the film "Rose",  including the fascinating story by Casting Director Leslie Litvak who happened to see Mozart perform [Ashes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qae-0U9WsRE "\"Ashes\" by Mozart ") at the Sammons Center For the Arts:

This film "Rose" had an extraordinary cast and crew so it was a wonderful first film experience for Mozart. It was written and directed by Israel Marquez who has done quite a few films that have garnered many awards. He has a very interesting creative background including performing on Johnny Carson as a young teen. [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/06/wings-mozart-rocks-little-mix-and-lookssings-like-a-pop-star.html "Mozart teen pop star") was so grateful to win this challenging role.

Actress Katie Walker played her mom ( who was in a wheel chair). There were tears shed by the crew and cast at moments as it is touching film and story.  
  
They bonded  through this role but they both are also involved with healing the cause of Human Trafficking. Katie was in the film "8 Days' on this topic and Mozart just did a fundraiser with Hope Generation for this cause where she played [her song](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/01/buy-mozarts-song-youre-not-alone-on-itunes-googleplay-or-amazon-.html "\"You're Not Alone\" by Mozart") "[You're Not Alone".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWyaDc-UXHU "\"You're Not Alone\" by Mozart ")

on a low budget and with long hours,

In the picture below you see actor and director Bill Hass laughing with Mozart during a break in a tough scene where he tells her she is dying. He also won a best acting award for this film.

The last photo shows Mozart with her director as they get ready to shoot a scene of her playing the violin. They had a great rapport  during the audition process as well as filming and we're so grateful he took a chance on her for her first film.   
  

**"Mozart is the most talented girl I have ever met. Second to none. I don't say this much about anyone but after hearing Mozart sing live I truly know I'm in the presence of greatness."**

What an exciting time this is and what a blessing that this first Best Actress Award came so early in Mozart's career!

Mozart had a brilliant time swimming and splashing with the swans on this beautiful canal where we would take a boat ride in from our campsite to visit and see Shakespeare plays at [world famous Stratford-upon-Avon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratford-upon-Avon "wikipedia info on Stratford upon Avon"). It is hailed as the [birthplace of William Shakespeare](http://www.onlineshakespeare.com/birthplace.htm "information about Shakespeares birthplace") and filled with the charm of ["The heart of England's " Cotswolds.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotswolds "wikipedia info about Cotswolds/heart of England")

You can see the rental cottages available in this large [park-like campsite](http://www.ukcampsite.co.uk/sites/reviews.asp?revid=3407 "reviews of & info about campite where we stayed") that is a less than a mile away from the center of town. Mozart has become use to swimming French style with no top which is most common in Europe. She has long been a huge fan of [Shakespeare](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1yIn5UNS1k "clip from Zefferelli's Romeo & Juliet -a dvd we travel with!") and was so happy to get a pin from [The Royal Shakespeare Company](http://www.rsc.org.uk/home/default.aspx "info about the Royal Shakespeare Company Stratford") & to be able to watch a Shakespeare plays outside next to [Shakespeare houses](http://www.shakespeare.org.uk/ "info about Shakespeare houses")!Â 

We are sunny and warm here in Spain, but I thought our armchair travelers in snowy regions, [including the UK](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2708283.stm "record snows in UK"), might enjoy this sunshine photo break! This canal was only feet away from our RV, so Mozart enjoyed dipping in between visits to town.

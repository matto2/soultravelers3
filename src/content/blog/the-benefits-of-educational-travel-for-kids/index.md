Can travel help children learn? I've written before about [learning vacations](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/learning-vacations-educational-trips-that-teach-kids.html "learning vacations") and e[ducational trips that teach kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/travel-schooling-learning-through-travel.html#more "educational trips that teach kids") as it is one of my passions and reasons why we  [travel as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "world travel as a family") and do [world school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "wold school") as we roam. I've also written about the benefits of [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") and [kid-friendly travel perks](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/kid-friendly-travel-perks.html "kid friendly travel perks").  No matter how you travel or vacation, taking kids will benefit the whole family.  
  
"Don't tell me how educated you are, tell me how much you traveled."

Sometimes there is learning even in the [souvenirs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/souvenirs-what-do-you-buy-.html "souvenirs") that you bring home, like our [Sand Art from Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/sand-art-in-jordan.html "sand art from jordan")! This photo is our 10 year old playing Jordan Monopoly in Barcelona! It was a spectacular gift for us from our [Jordan trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "jordan trip ") that will help us remember that trip forever.  
  
( Note the cheetos indulgence was when Dad was on duty because I was dealing with [travel health](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health") issues and this pattern is one reason we are being very strict this year as far as [healthy travel food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy travel food")).  
  
One of the great joys of travel is it is experiential, hands-on learning that stays with you for a lifetime. Every time Mozart reads a book or sees a movie about a place we have visited, she has a depth of understanding that can not be gotten any other way.  
  
Books and movies are a great way to enhance travel before, during and after. Here is how we used books to create a kids itinerary in Venice:

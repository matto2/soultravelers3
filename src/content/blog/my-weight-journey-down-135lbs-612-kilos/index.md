Yay, I am down 135lbs/ ( 61.2 kilos) since Jan 2022, which is truly a miracle for a woman over 50 & I just turned 70 in March. I am down 30lbs since I blogged about my weight loss journey in March.  
This has been a life long battle that I am finally finding ways to master. Being here in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/04/21-of-the-best-things-to-do-in-barcelona-in-2022.html#more) just makes it more special.

In the four part photo, the first photo with white tee is from 2017 when I was at my highest weight and started working on this issue again as I have had many ups and downs and struggles with it. The second photo in the grey outfit is from November 2021 and finally at that point, the weight loss started to show a bit, even my daughter Heavenly noticed and my waist started to return. The third photo in the black exercise outfit is from March when I announced my weight loss on this blog. And the last photo in this same outfit I took this week before we met with upholstery and interior painting contractors here near Barcelona for our van conversion tiny home remodeling.

The weight loss is more subtle now, but I am so pleased I managed to lose another 30lbs despite hectic [travel this summer](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/04/top-tips-for-planning-a-summer-trip-to-europe-2022-cheaply.html#more) and even eating a little paella with our friends upon arrival!   
  
You will note the grey pants in the 2nd photo were my old "skinny" pants and I was thrilled to be able to get them on in November and now they are too baggy on me and I've thrown out a ton of "fat" clothes. I am keeping a photo and video journal of my weight loss process and will share it when I reach my final destination and will write the book as we roam the world and I maintain my ideal weight and health

More to go to reach my goal in both these areas, but it is exciting to see the change and I am so enjoying walking, biking, swimming here, working out and eating healthy. Big completions bring such joy!  
  
I plan on writing an ebook about my weight loss journey and transformation, any suggestions for titles?  
  
What do you most want to know about my weight loss and weight loss and fitness motivation?

**MANDARIN PHYSICS BOOK**

As the only [American in her Mandarin school in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "American in Mandarin school in Asia"), we are learning as we go as we immerse her deeply through a [Chinese school in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin Chinese school in Penang"). Some things you just can't know until you are on the ground and doing it, so one must remain flexible.  
  
Unlike her friends in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California best beach") or [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "friends in Europe"), school is still in session here in Asia for our 11 year old daughter and we remain focused on our [language learning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "language learning how to raise a bilingual") primary goal. After a meeting with the principal, we have just switched her to her 3rd class here in six months. I think this will be a big improvement though, even if it will be harder for Mozart in the beginning.  
  
We've made some errors because we can't do it like we [schooled in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "schooled in Spain for language immersion") or [homeschooling while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling while traveling"), so have to make a new way.  Because of her age ( language learning is easier before puberty) we want to get as much deep Mandarin in her as possible now.  
  
Not just for the Mandarin, [studies show that bilinguals](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-benefits-of-bilingualism.html "studies show bilinguals have many advantages, smarter") and trlinguals from birth have many advantages including increased creativity and an easier time solving harder problems than a single language learner ( just as musicians have brain advantages from early, years-long training).

Our thought is why not three while young as a foundation?

**MANDARIN BIOLOGY BOOK**  
  
The first year for foreign students at this Mandarin high school, is a special foundation class that is almost all Mandarin with a little English as most students don't know either or little. We didn't know how this worked when we arrived, so we had plans to leave in May, thus she only got half a year since we arrived in November,but the school year here starts on Jan 1 and ends in November. It would have been better to have done that full year.  
  
We did our best to do as much Mandarin as possible as we traveled the world and the school was very supportive, including doing some classes via Skype with the Dean of Students. We also worked with other online teachers. Nevertheless, she was at a disadvantage this way.  
  
She still spoke too much English in that class in my opinion, because that was the common language amongst many of the foreign students. Her best friends then were from Indonesia and Korea and they spoke mostly in English together. Still her Mandarin improved, but not as quickly as she progressed in Spain where there were no Spanish local English speakers ( but she did have one UK boy in her class and they talked in English as well as some other expat kids on the playground).  
  
She returned to join this same class group this February, and in this second year they are no longer in the foundation class, but more Thai students, mostly boys were added to the class. The Thai kids have a really hard time adjusting to the Chinese style of discipline, can't speak English or Mandarin well, so they are quite wild and get caned many times every day.

**PHYSICS IN MANDARIN AND HER NOTES**  
  
Mozart did not like the wild Thai boys who would tease here, hit her or take things from her desk and such, so we quickly moved her to a class that was mostly locals along with about 8 Koreans who were strong in English ( many having gone to an American primary school here to give them good English). They used a curriculum from Cambridge University out of the UK along with their Mandarin. There was virtually no caning in this class because the kids were well behaved and use to the system.  
  
I had some concerns about this class, but we tried it, partly because then she would have Mandarin classes with just 8 students instead of 44, she would be with mostly Chinese locals and away from the wild boys. Despite being years younger than the other students in her class, and coming in 2 months late this year, Mozart did great and is at the top of her class. She loves projects and several of hers were picked to be displayed, often ones that are suppose to be a group project with several students, she frequently does them all by herself but gives credit to the others.  
  
She really enjoyed the social aspects of this class, but I started worrying about how much English she was getting and communicating in all day long. The local students talked to each other in Mandarin, but since they are very strong in English and she is weaker in Mandarin, they often talked in English together. The Koreans also talked in English mostly as they are use to that. She was hearing lots of Mandarin, but also too much English in my view.

**MANDARIN HISTORY BOOK**  
  
Our whole reason for being here and at this school is to immerse in Mandarin. The school is use to dealing with foreign students, but never had one that was a native English speaker who has different needs than those needing to improve their English too, as English-as -2nd-language-learners like locals.  We're trying to use a system that is not made for native English speakers. Mozart knows more than the teachers teaching English because she is a very well read native speaker and they only know English as a second language ( on British system).  
  
Deep Chinese immersion for many years along with deep and regular study of the language and history is the only way to really learn Mandarin. So we felt like we needed to brainstorm wi th the principal to find  a way to meet Mozart's unique needs at the school. I would love to take her totally out of the advanced English as a second language class as it is a total waste of her time ( despite her enjoying it) , but it is compulsory in Malaysian schools, they say.  
  
We had a similar problem with English class in Spain, but finally got her out of it after several years. Dealing with any school can be challenging because they are made for mass learning, not individual needs, but I must say that both this school in Penang and the one in Spain have been very generous and helpful to us and our odd way of schooling around the world which has us coming and going on our terms. ( More helpful than American schools we attended, where we found virtually no flexibility other than allowing her to begin several years early based on her advanced abilitiies...which they don't usually do).

**MANDARIN WRITING IS HARD TO LEARN**  
  
Don't let others fool you who say Mandarin is not hard, or doesn't take years to be fluent, as they are talking about conversational Mandarin, which is doomed to "sounds clever at a party" status, perhaps somewhat useful for China travel, but not deeply fluent speaking, reading and writing Mandarin. Just think how limited you would be in English if you did not read or write it or had a very limited vocabulary.  
  
Listen to these comments from truly fluent Mandarin speakers where most say total immersion and hard studying  for at least 4 years is necessary ( from the recent [Economist article](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "economist article about learning Mandarin in Asia") I wrote about recently):  
  
"Characters don't really fit into our mental models. If you think of them as words, that will only get you so far. Most units of meaning are actually composed of compound characters. So you can learn that 東 (dong) means "east" and 西 (xi) means west. But 東西 means "something" and "不東西" means "nothing". Knowing the component characters often only gives you a vague guess about the full compound.  
  
In a sense, Chinese has a kind of 40,000 letter alphabet."  
  
  
  
"I would say, however, that learning to read, and especially to write, takes a lot more time than learning to speak. In Taiwan and China, locals learn to read only by putting in much longer school days than we have in North America, and learn to write only by writing out each character countless times, while also being exposed to them during their long hours spent learning to read."

**WHY MANDARIN TAKES SO LONG**  
  
I think this comment though, explains best about [why Mandarin is so hard](http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html "why Mandarin is so hard"), especially the writing, and takes so long for an English or European learners:  
  
"Literary Chinese, where multi-character words or phrases are truncated from, say, four characters into two, presupposes that the reader has learned the original phrase. Otherwise the effect is akin to reading an English text brimming with unintelligible acronyms. The same principle applies to the need to learn chengyu, the myriad (literally) figures of speech that inhabit both literature and common speech. There are simply no shortcuts to rote memorization, and to be effective, one probably needs to foster some appreciation for the historical context in which some of the phrases or figures of speech arose."  
  
And it also explains our delimma and challenges  at this juncture. We moved our child to an all local Chinese class where she is taking physics, Biology, History, Math, Art, Geography etc all in Mandarin. The school has never done this before and it is clearly way over her head. She understands the subjects, but the Mandarin is at a very advanced level since these kids are all fluent in it as their primary language and have been doing school work in it for 8 long years.  
  
Poor kid has to go after school every day to work with a tutor one-on-one ( what they call "tuition" here and it is common) to bridge what she is missing and help her catch up in Mandarin. We've asked her to also only talk Mandarin while in school except for English class and to do lunch with these new kids ( who are much weaker in English) in Mandarin rather than with her friends who are fluent in English.  We start the day with Mandarin movies and go to bed with them and plan to do even more of Mandarin Pop Karoke and movies for entertainment.

It is a very hard decision for basically unschoolers like us who like to have a lot of time together and believe in lots of play and self directed free time as learning, but we are three weeks into it now and it feels right for her Mandarin. She wakes up at 6 A.M and comes home from school around 5 or 6 P.M., so they are long days, so very typical Chinese schooling. She even goes on Saturday, although that is primarily co-curriculum ( choir) for her which she enjoys. We will most likely try this until the end of the year and see how she improves.  
  
She already says she is getting better. We don't know if it is too far over her head, we will just have to see how it unfolds, but the more intense Mandarin should be a positive hopefully for her language acquisition. These additional Mandarin courses give her opportunities for more vocabulary learning. She can do the Algebra, just doesn't always know what the Mandarin in it says.  
  
This class also has to take Bahasa Melayu ( the local language very similar to Indonesian and supposedly one of the easiest languages in the world to learn) so that gives her free time as she usually enjoys drawing or song writing when that is going on. She gets all her homework done before coming home, so there is still time to play with locals here a bit and relax before bedtime.  
  
We are less interested in her doing perfectly in Mandarin Physics ( etc) than her learning more Mandarin through immersion. She will just do the best she can and we will support her the best we can. We will also have her do a fun class like [Udacity's Intro to Phyisics](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/ph100/CourseRev/1 "Udacity intro to physics") and [Kahn Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/ "kahn academy") to help her understand the concepts in English.

In some ways she has the best of both worlds as she still has Chinese class and English class with her good friends from the last class, so maintains those friendships. This new advanced Mandarin class also has only 32 students instead of 44 in her last two classes this year. She is also meeting new friends from another major Mandarin school here after her tuition as her van lets her off at a tuition center that is close to that school ( and our home) and then they all take another van home together. She does that three days a week and two after school at her school where she gets to socialize a bit with kids there too before and after.  
  
So even though it is long hours and more challenging, she is not working the whole time as some of it is social time as school is out at 2:30. It's not our preferred way of being, but we voted as a family to try this for this second semester here and see how it goes. She often comes home laughing ( enjoys the girls in the van) so that is a good sign. I also think it is good to learn that sometimes one sacrifices to reach a goal and Mozart does want her Mandarin to be very fluent. Plus she just had 10 months of self led learning homeschool and free time, so good to mix both worlds and approaches to learning.  
  
We're also planning a trip into China in November where she will live with a Chinese family ( who speaks no English) and go to a local school with their child for a month to increase her Mandarin even more. ( We parents will have to learn Mandarin to talk to her). We've been told that a month of no English, ( given her high level of Mandarin now) and immersed so deeply, will bring her to an almost native level ( with a good accent) , which will make the whole writing process even easier when she returns to her Penang school as well as more easy socializing in Mandarin here.  
  
Our goal is to get her Mandarin up to the same level as her Spanish and English as quickly as we can, so hoping these new changes will help. I loved this quote from that article in the Economist from a fluent Mandarin Speaker who is American:  
  
  
"Far easier to get a degree in Engineering, build an automobile, learn 10 operas or learn C++, Oracle and Calculus combined than to speak Mandarin fluently as an adult."  
  

 Since it is so hard to learn as an adult, our race is on to complete this in childhood, before puberty. Any other questions about our schooling process?

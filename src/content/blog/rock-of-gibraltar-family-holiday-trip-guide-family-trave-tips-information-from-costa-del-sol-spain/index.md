Driving through southern [Spain's Costa Del Sol,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/road-to-ronda.html) one can't help but be moved and mesmerized by the mysterious magical monolith known as the infamous [Rock of Gibraltar.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar), one of the [pillars of Hercules.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Hercules)  Taking a city break - [family holiday trip, like kids on a vacation](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html#more) from our vacation, we rented a car (42 euros for a day) to go monkey around with the [unique Barbary Apes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/monkeys-taxi-te.html#more), admire the views and [learn a little history](http://www.discovergibraltar.com/). Don't skip [Seville](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/ole-sublime-sev.html), [Ronda](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/02/spains-oldest-b.html), [Cordoba,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/el-caballo-rojo.html) [Jerez](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/05/joys-of-the-roa.html), or [Granada](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/la-alhambra.html) first,  but if you have extra time while [visiting Andalusia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/ahh-arab-baths-andalusia-spa-malaga-granada-benalmedena-massage-hotspringsthemal-water-roman.html), Gibraltar is a fun, quick day trip. Just experiencing it's foreboding presence  from a distance is probably the most powerful impact because of it's size, reputation and how it separates Europe from Africa.

It was a misty morning when we set out from [our village in Andalusia,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html#more) a two and half hour pleasant drive  via all good, non-crowded highways with beautiful Mediterranean coastal views on one side and lush greenery,  majestic mountains, overflowing wild flowers, and ancient white hillside villages on the other. Soon, the ever present [Costa Del Sol](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/02/marbella.html) sun returned as we passed the natural beauty of [Marbella](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/malaga-marbella.html) along with it's many McVillas , gated estates and golf courses. Like most people who [winter in Andalusia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html), we've been to Gibraltar before and have a bank there, so it was part business, but [we plucked Mozart out of school for the day](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html) to make it a fun family affair.

Look closely at my lighthouse on Gibraltar photo and you can see Africa in the distance behind the sailboat, the other Hercules pillar across the famous [Strait of Gibraltar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar). Look on [any map](http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/gibraltar.htm) and one quickly understands why this jagged Jurassic limestone rock, almost 1400 feet tall, has such [a tumultuous history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Gibraltar) & the strife continues today to some degree. The Brits love it because it is like having a bit of  Old Blighty with sun (plus cheap booze and cigarettes), but as a neutral observer, it does seem a little ridiculous that this tiny space ( less than five square kilometers) does not belong to Spain which is right next to it. You literally just walk across the road, but I guess strategic locations are still worth fighting about. Such is life.

We drove across from [La Linea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_L%C3%ADnea_de_la_Concepci%C3%B3n), but many walk in. It is one of the few places where passports are checked  when crossing borders in Europe.The line was very long and slow, even though we were there on a week day mid-morning during off season, so beware if you come in high season. You actually walk across a live small airport landing strip and traffic is always super crowded in tiny Gibraltar, with more mopeds than I've ever seen zipping in and out plus virtually no parking anywhere and some pretty crazy, dangerous roads, in the upper area. This is not a good place to [bring a motorhome to Europe,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html#more) thus our motivation to rent a car.

To be honest, I [would not go out of my way to enter Gibraltar if I had a limited time in Spain](http://gospain.about.com/od/topspanishcities/p/gibraltar.htm), as there is not much there and it pales in comparison to the key sites in southern Spain, plus it's expensive. They wanted 10 pounds each to just see the view from the top which was pretty insane and not worth it in my opinion. The best of Gibraltar you can see for free from the Spanish side. Not surprisingly, it is a popular spot for Cruise ships and there are lots of ways one can spend money if you are in the mood, but most are wasteful.

The [BIGGEST tourism draw in Gibraltar](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/international/europe/28monkey.html) are the [monkeys,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar_Barbary_Macaques) or rather [Barbary Macaques](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/monkeys-taxi-te.html#more) which are the only that are native in the entire continent of Europe.You will also see tons more in the multitude of souvenir stores that cover the main street. Mozart fell in love with this pink one, but with our minimalist, travel lifestyle, we "buy" such things with a hug and photo. Get the experience, save the money.

**HIGHLIGHTS TO SEE IN GIBRALTAR**

\***Cable Car**

**Ape's Den**

**St. Michael's Cave**

There are many day tours from Spain that you can easily find on the internet or through the local tourist boards, but I've never taken them, so can't personally recommend any. There are also some dolphin watching boat trips that some might like. All the sights can be seen in a short time.

So what was 9 year old Mozart's favorite part? After a Subway sandwich lunch out in the sun, on the way back to our car, we found a scraggly little pet shop and she got to pick up and cuddle a little puppy. She is still talking about it and was the highlight of Gibraltar for her. Kid's! Forget the wild and dangerous monkeys, she has already seen them up close in Morocco, but puppy love close up , won her over. But that will help her always remember it so perhaps puppy cuddles and history are a perfect combination!

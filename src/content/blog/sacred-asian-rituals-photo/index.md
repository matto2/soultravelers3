 I don't understand the sacred rituals I see [in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/chines.html "tea ceremony asia") or [around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/around-the-world-family-travel/ "around the world"), but just the fact that we humans find ways and the time to pray, show respect, honor, love, bless, sanctify and make or see something as holy,  moves something in my heart.

In [Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/travel-to-bhutan-.html "bhutan travel") we spun prayer wheels and [climbed mountain to monestary](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html "bhutan travel tigers nest"), in Istanbul we prayed in a [the Blue Mosque](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/topaki-palace-b.html "the blue mosque"), in Penang we celebrated in the [largest Buddhist temple in Southeast Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/stunning-kek-lok-si-largest-buddhist-temple-in-se-asia.html "largest buddhist temple in southeast asia") and daily hear the Islamic calls to prayer, in China we learned more about Lao Tzu and Confucius, in Crete we learned about ancient Gods at the [Palace of Knossos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/the-palace-of-k.html "palace of knossos"), in [Morocco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/morocco/ "morocco travel")  we had a [taxi](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/monkeys-taxi-te.html "grand taxi tourism in Morocco") driver who bowed to his God in the [Sahara desert](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html "sahara desert"), in the USA we learned about American Indian traditions, black gospel churches in Harlem, aboriginal customs in Australia and Maori, [Hawaiian](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html "Hawaiin culture") and French Polynesian practices. We loved them all.  
  
We've visited stunning churches in [Granada](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/la-alhambra.html)'s  [Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada_Cathedral); The [Basilica of St. Mark in Venice](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/piazza-san-marc.html#more) ; [Seville's Cathedra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/cathedral-colum.html)l where Columbus is buried; [Notre Dame](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/notre-dame-left.html) is quintessential Gothic; the [Prague Cathedrals](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/11/prague-at-night.html) are filled with music;  [Portugal's Alcobaca Cathedral](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/08/alcobaca.html#more) is serene;  [pilgrims go to the famous Santiago de Compostela](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/08/santiago-de-com.html?cid=128254188)  ; a [Michelangelo is in  Brugge](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/michelangelo-in.html#more), at the Church of Our Lady;  [St. Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/12/finally-vienna.html) is a Gothic masterpiece;  Barcelona's famous [Sagrada Familia by Gaudi](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/gaudis-sagrada.html#more) is unique as is [the Mezquita in Cordoba](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/la-mezquita.html). I've been to  [Charters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartres_Cathedral), [Winchester Cathedra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Cathedral)l,  [St. Patrick's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral,_New_York), the Vatican's [St. Peter's Basilica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Basilica) and [Mont Saint- Michel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Saint-Michel) which are all  classic. I've seen a gorgeous simple rock church in Finland, 5000 year old cave churches filled with [Byzantine art in Cappadocia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/frescoes-underg.html)  and beautiful orthodox churches all over Russia including [St Basil's Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Basil%27s_Cathedral)  in Moscow's Red Square which is awesome.  
  
In 7 years of non-stop [world travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "world travel"), we've seen this and so  much more, and still... from the most simple to the most elaborate.... people worshipping gives me greater faith in humanity. Despite world leaders sometimes manipulating people to wars and atrocities that happen in the name of religion, I see our inner calling for a higher purpose and connection a positive thing and the fact that almost all of it has a core belief about loving and peace.

In this holy season,( and always)  I am praying for and visualizing more peace, love, and acceptance for all of us sharing this sweet planet. Hoping my tiny contribuion of [travel photos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/family-travel-photo/ "travel photos") and positive focus can help me and all of us keep our eyes more on the beauty and good every where.  
  
Let us celebrate what is right in the world!

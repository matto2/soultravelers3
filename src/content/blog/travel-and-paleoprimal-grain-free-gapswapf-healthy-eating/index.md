Can you travel the world and  
eat healthy on a very non-standard  
diet like Paleo, Vegan, WAPF, GAPS

Meanwhile living on a very tight budget and a [super minimalist life](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/02/minimalist-family-frugal-tip-omg.html "super minimalist life"), thus [traveling with little luggage](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/top-travel-tip-for-long-term-travel.html "top travel tips for packing light")?  
  
Trust me, it is a challenge, but can be done! I will be writing more details about how we do this but here are a few keys that work for us on our healing journey:  
  
**KEEP IT SIMPLE**  
  
M**AKE PICNICS - EVEN FOR PLANE RIDES OR ROAD TRIPS**  
  
**CONNECT WITH LOCAL FARMERS**  
  
**ADJUST YOUR DIET TO WHAT IS CHEAP AND HEALTHY IN EACH AREA**  
  
**PLAN AHEAD**  
  
**USE THE INTERNET TO CONNECT WITH COMMUNITIES ONLINE THAT EAT LIKE YOU IN EACH AREA**  
  
**HAVE DELICIOUS FOOD HANDY SO YOU ARE NOT TEMPTED**

It is actually fun, easy, educational and entertaining to connect with local farmers. Before we left [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/asia/ "Asia travel tips") recently,Â  I googled things like [LocalHarvest](http://www.localharvest.org/ "local harvest find healthy food") and [Eat Wild](http://www.eatwild.com/products/ "eat wild") and found farmers in places we'd be in order to get the food we'd need. I did similar online sleuthing before we went to Australia recently.  
  
This photo was taken at [Nikki Farms in Fresno, California](http://www.localharvest.org/niki-farms-M55580 "Nikki farms fresno eggs and mandarins") where we got LOTS of organic pastured eggs and a few Mandarin oranges. It really feels good to know exactly where your food is coming from, meet folks passionate about healthy food, sustainable living and make new friends!  
  
How do you meet special dietary needs while traveling?

Historic Key West Florida is the southern most city in the continental United States and an exciting destinations for [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel"). The drive alone can be a thrill as we took the [famous Overseas Highway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "florida road trip") which links all the towns and islands of the Florida Keys with the mainland.  
  
I haven't been in the Key West in over 30 years and in some ways it remains the same, despite all the changes.When we first drove in, I didn't recognize it with all the new construction, but the old town looked the same. It's still a wonderful place to wander around, perhaps even more so as a family.  
  
I loved the old Key West and I love the new one. It is still a fabulous tropical paradise with it's own special charms. I adored this little square where we shopped a bit before doing the most traditonal of all things in Key West...enjoying a sunset.  
  
Have you been to Key West? What is your favorite part?

If you want to meet us, now is your chance! We have a few great opportunities coming up in London ( on Oct 3rd), San Francisco ( on Oct 5th) and Singapore ( on Nov 14th). I think we will also do a meet up in Sydney, ( we visit between Nov 8th and 12th)  but I do not have a place there yet, so will announce those details later.

Lot's of people want to get together, but since we are always traveling, mostly use mass transit and [educating our child on the go](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html), it's not always easy. We are off to London for a very short stay over this weekend ( Oct 34rd and 4th)  but if you live nearby or are in the neighborhood, come join us at the [Hempel Hotel](http://www.the-hempel.co.uk/) where a [dear friend of ours is doing a book signing that is open to the public.](http://www.msia.org/Event/detail/314) The booksigning is between 2 and 5pm, but we can meet folks in the lobby before and after. Our plane leaves very early the next morning, so we won't be up late.

We are thrilled that we will be [interviewed by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) while in London and hope to all see the [show "Les Miserables" for it's 25th anniversary](http://www.lesmis.com/)  as a great homeschool addition to our recent [trip to  France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/france/index.html). Jam packed two days!

We are staying at the gorgeous [San Francisco Fairmont](http://www.fairmont.com/sanfrancisco) ( they are hosting our stay) so we will have a "meet up" there in the lobby near the bar at 7pm on October 5th.

We are also staying at the [beautiful Fairmont in Singapore](http://www.fairmont.com/singapore). ( Fairmont is an amazing sponsor and tops at hopitality). We will do a meet up there on November 14th at 7PM and also meet in the Lobby.

We look forward to meeting you there!

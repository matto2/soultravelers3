Following the likes of Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron, Gigi Hadid  & more who were featured in music videos, Mozart was thrilled to be chosen out of the thousands who auditioned. At 17, she was the youngest on set and only teen to be hired.   
  
Mozart did a Youtube video giving more details about her experience ( Please leave a comment):

Mozart had a blast singing & working with Ariana and it was especially fun for them to connect in this way as the very first concert that she went to was an Ariana Grande concert in Dallas, Texas in 2015.

Mozart has been working hard in the recording studio too for the last few months with Grammy-winning producer Mikal Blue and has created an awesome catalogue of new songs. She will be releasing her own female empowerment song, "Push You Harder" and music video soon ( likely September), followed by her EP in a few months. She was recently featured in [VoyageLA magazine](VoyageLA%20magazine "Mozart Dee award winning actress & singer").

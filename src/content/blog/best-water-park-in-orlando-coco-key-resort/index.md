Looking for an amazingly [fun time in Orlando](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-kids-review.html "fun time in orlando - harry potter") with your family? Do you love water slides and water parks? Looking for the best budget resort for your [Florida vacation](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "florida road trip vacation tips")?  
  
The [best water park in Orlando](http://www.cocokeyorlando.com/coco-key-water-park/ "Best water park in Orlando coco key resort") is at the Coco Key Resort and it is a fantastic place to stay, (especially for famiies or anyone who loves a water slide), for a holiday, weekend or [get away](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/florida-sun-winter-getaway.html "Florida getaway"). We spent five nights there and still are raving about the fun we had.  
  
I will be writing  a detailed review of the hotel, but wanted to get this post up first, so folks don't miss this gem. We were just reminiscing about how awesome this water park was, when I realized I hadn't written about it yet.

**WATER PARK BIRTHDAY FANTASY**  
  
You can tell by the look on their faces, that my family was enjoying this fantasy, colorful setting as we celebrated our daughter's eleventh birthday with lots of water fun in this 54,000 sq-ft, canopy-covered, outdoor water park.  Coco Key Water Park has 14 slides, 4 pools, a children's interactive play island, video arcade, snack bar and more!  
  
Water park access is included in the low price of the hotel, but day passes are also available.

When I showed this video to my daughter and told her this is where we were staying on our [Florida vacation](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/florida-family-vacation-fun.html "florida vacation") in Orlando, she squealed with delight. It's centrally located on International Drive and close to  Universal Studios Orlando, Walt Disney World, Sea World, restaurants and anything one would need. After a long day at a theme park, one needs a play day to recover or hot tub to relax in.

It's a place that makes kids as well as there parents happy. They have a more mellow pool and hot tub that I liked best, so something for the youngest, including babies, to the oldest here. We saw young couples, seniors, families, singles and met people there from Florida, across the USA, as well as Europe on vacation. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  
  
We are super grateful to [Visit Florida](http://www.visitflorida.com/ "visit florida") and [Visit Orlando](http://www.visitorlando.com/ "visit orlando") who were fantastic in helping us plan our [Florida  trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/south-beach-miami-at-night.html "Florida trip")  on our tight budget. Thanks so much  to [Coco Key Resort](http://www.cocokeyorlando.com/about-the-resort/ "Coco Key Resort orlando") for sponsoring our stay, as this is just the kind of place we would have picked on our own and it was even better than we expected.

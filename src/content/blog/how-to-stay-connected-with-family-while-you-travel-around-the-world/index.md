How do you stay in touch with family and friends [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world family")? It's easier than ever today, thanks to tech and doesn't cost anything. Here you see our 11 year old having a Skype video conversation in Asia  with her Grandma in California. She is using the webcam to give her a tour of her imaginary world from a fancy but free minimalist dollhouse made from a thrown out cardboard box.  
  
She loves this kind of imaginary play around the world as you can see in [Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/heavenly-holida.html "croatia"), [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/hanging-out-roa.html "Barcelona"), [Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/workyoutube-pla.html "portugal"), [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-play-date.html "Andalusia play") and [every place we've been.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "birthdays around the world")  Mozart likes to [create her own worlds](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/kid-friendly-travel-perks.html "creating imaginary worlds kids playmobile and doll house") with her Lego and Playmobile toys, but she is also [very artistic](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/kids-art-creativity-travel-family-friendly-travel-education-homeschool-roadschool-.html "art and travel"), so makes her own toys out of paper, colored pencils, scissors and tape or glue. She loves to give tours and share.  
  
**THE ADVANTAGES OF FREE WEBCAM CALLS**  
  
She gave a similar tour to her [best friends in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "Best friends in spain") as well as all her friends here in person. I don't think we could have done these last 7 years of [non-stop world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "non-stop world travel as a family") without the tech available today and most importantly free webcam calls.  
  
We don't feel so far away because of tech and keep our relationships up this way. Mozart was able to share losing all her baby teeth around the world from her [first missing tooth in France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/first-missing-t.html "first missing tooth in France").[  
](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "birthdays around the world")She shares her [art work](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/mobile-mozart-a.html "kids artwork around the world roadschool"), [winning a trophy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/chinese-school-trophy-girl-.html "winning a trophy"), introduces new friends, [plays violin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html " child Plays violin around the world") or [piano](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/12/pool-play-piano.html "piano") and more with her Grandmother on a regular basis. It's helped us deal with [mourning on the road](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "mourning on the road") with deaths from both sides and staying connected during those trying times.  
  
Yes, we use our blog, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soultravelers3 "Twitter") ( great in a [medical emergency abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330120a63d94cf970c "medical emergency abroad")) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187 "soultravelers3 facebook") too, as well as post cards, visits home and [them coming to us](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "travel with Grandma") and we use Skype for many things inclucing [piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=0Ar90wOnWnM "piano lessons online") and violin lessons with teachers on other continents, but freee webcam calls with family and friends is essential for a [traveling lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "traveling lifestyle").  
  
The possibilities for connection are endless. How do you use webcam calls or tech to stay close with loved ones at a distance?

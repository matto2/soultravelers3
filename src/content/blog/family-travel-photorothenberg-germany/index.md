We are starting a new category today, so settle back in a comfy spot and come along for a little armchair travel! We will be having these new Family Travel  Photo moments on  a regular basis every few days and sometimes daily, in between longer posts. They will be from random places on our travels as we tour the world.

I have been doing this on [Twitpics](http://twitpic.com/tag/soultravelers3 "twitpic soultravelers3 collection tagged soultravelers3")  to some extent, as we travel to give you a peek of what is coming. I post one or two of our recent pictures there, particularly while moving, but also in our village. I decided to follow the lead of  fellow travel blogger , [Alltop Travel](http://travel.alltop.com/ "Alltop Travel")  colleague and  [twitter](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3 "Soultravelers3 twitter profile page") friend [Vagabondish](http://www.vagabondish.com/photo-tango-lesson-moscow-russia/ "Vagabondish photo"). 

We seem to have an endless collection to share of our world tour as a three-camera-toting family. It will give you more to look at and you will have less wait time in between posts!

We happen to come upon this surreal scene in beautiful Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany this past fall when all the tourists were gone and the locals were having a medieval festival. We were there for a few weeks and loved this village. It is on the Romantic Road and we had a magical day!

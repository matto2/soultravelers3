Doesn't that look delicious? It says summer to me and let me tell you those fresh blueberries were delicious! Family travel often means grabbing some scrumptious fruit for a picnic or even a nibble as one roams with a kidlet in tow.

We love the markets we come upon around the world, especially the charming ones. We just stumbled upon this one while wandering around the beautiful, upscale [countryside in England](http://www.the-cotswolds.org/). Everything was displayed in a lovely manner and soon Mozart was busy munching away as she loves berries. We did also find some raspberries to pick that were fresh off the vine, but these we took the short cut way.

We eat [a lot of fruit and vegetables](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html) so appreciate them as it is a bit of a delicate art, keeping the right amount around in hot weather while in an RV with a tiny fridge. The [Brits call candy, "sweeties"](http://www.seabrite.com/jeffs_great_british_eats/food_glossary.htm), so I always tell Mozart that the "sweeties" made from God is fruit.

What is your favorite summer fruit?

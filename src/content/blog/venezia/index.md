Venezia  
May 20, 2007

“Abandon wheels all ye who enter here!” Watching that famous skyline  
grow closer from our ferry was a thrill as I have never approached  
Venice from the sea upon arrival and it is an exciting way to do it.

“Abandon wheels all ye who enter here!” Watching that famous skyline grow closer from our ferry was a thrill as I have never approached Venice from the sea upon arrival and it is an exciting way to do it. We passed the sixteenth century masterpiece San Giorgio Maggiore on its own island and then docked right near Piazza San Marco, one of the most famous and beautiful squares in the world.

The heat wave continued in Venice for the first few days and I think it is always crowded in the main areas, but it did not stop us from loving and enjoying this unique city. I love just walking around enjoying the architecture, beauty and boats. Call me corny, but I still thrill at every sighting of a gondola. I don’t care that it is a tourist haven, I still love Venice!

Venice was built between the sixth and eighth centuries on 117 little islands and it is slowly sinking into the sea. I find it amazing that there are four hundred bridges that span 177 canals. If it was not so expensive, I could see myself living here. I especially liked exploring areas away from the tourists, especially in the Dorsoduro quarter. one gets a real feel of the real Venice.

If you notice that DaVinci is looking a little different in some of the recent photos, he did not forget to shave, but has decided to grow a goatee until his birthday, just for fun.

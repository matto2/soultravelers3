If you are looking to scare yourself silly, you might enjoy the [decorated skulls at the “Beinhaus” in Austria](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/salt-mine-iron.html "decorated skulls austria") or the [bone church in Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/book-fairwifi-b.html "bone church portugal") or maybe one of the [torture museums](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/11/more-santillana.html "torture museums Europe") in Europe, like this one in Spain.

Our young daughter actually enjoyed these sites and found them fascinating as most kids do, but they were too much for my taste. She also loved the [buried alive bodies from Pompeii](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/pompeiiburied-a.html "buried alive body Pompeii") which is another possible Halloween themed getaway if your kids like Horrible History kind of books like mine does.

During the last seven years on our [world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family trip around the world - long term travel"), we have had some fascinating [Halloweens, celebrating them around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/halloween-around-the-world.html "celebrating Halloween around the world"), even in places that don't [celebrate this holiday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/halloween-jack-o-lantern-fun.html "Halloween and pumpkins"). If you are traveling with a kid on Halloween, there is always a way to celebrate. This will be our first year of celebrating Halloween in Asia.

It is going to be hard to beat last year's Halloween as we were visiting Grandma in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "california") for the first Halloween at home in 6 years.  
  
[![catching candy at the Halloween parade](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3d078124970c.jpg "catching candy at the Halloween parade")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3d078124970c.jpg)  
  
She got to celebrate with old friends and relatives in the beach parade that she did for the first five years of her life and still remembered. I think she got to cherish it more than if we had done it every year there.

Combining sun, sea, beach and too much candy like only a lovely beachtown in California can do.

Our first year's [Halloween on while on the road traveling Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/happy-halloween.html "Halloween in Europe on road trip") was quite different in coastal Spain, but fun too.  
  
[![Halloween and trick or treating in Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3d07b368970c.png "Halloween and trick or treating in Italy")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3d07b368970c.png)  
  
We had an enchanting [Halloween in Umbria](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/03/ahhhumbria.html "Halloween in Italy") when she was eight among all the colorful vineyards with a costume we bought earlier in [Turkey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/sirince-charms.html "turkey travel") ( that she also wore to [tour Ephesus](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/ephesus-stellar.html "touring ephesus with kids") to add to the excitement for a young one and it's a [sweet souvenir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/souvenirs-what-do-you-buy-.html "souvenirs and travel")).  
  
[![Halloween in New York City](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3d07c8dc970c.jpg "Halloween in New York City")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3d07c8dc970c.jpg)  
  
One of her [favorite Halloween](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html "favorite halloween in NYC")'s was when we were in New York City to meet the disadvantedd kids in Harlem, Bronx, Queens etc. that we were taking with us [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world") virtually. We connected with Conde Nast travel writer Wendy Perrin and her family for a Halloween we will never forget. That year she went as her heroin Hermione from Harry Potter, a costume we purchased at [Hogwarts in England](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=FSB7Gictlag "flying with harry potter at hogwarts in UK").

The next year she tweaked that costume in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "barcelona") to turn it into a vampire theme as they scurried around one of our [favorite campsites](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "beach resort campground barcelona") trick or treating.  
  
[![hula girl](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c32d937be970b.jpg "hula girl")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c32d937be970b.jpg)  
  
We seem to have a [world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "world trip") habit now of buying costumes in one place and using them in another. When we discovered that we would be in [Bora Bora](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora vacation") on Halloween, we bought a hula girl costume in [Kauai](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html "kauai, Hawaii") on the way there. It was the perfect costume to trick or treat in [Tahiti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/the-ultimate-tahiti-vacation-on-a-backpacker-low-budget.html "tahitit travel tips")!  
  
[![costumes and parade in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c32d93d49970b.jpg "costumes and parade in Spain")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c32d93d49970b.jpg)  
  
  
Like her unusual [birthday celebrations around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "celebrating birthdays around the world"), Mozart is going to have some wild and crazy Halloween memories. And that doesn't even count her other opportunities of dressing in costume for celebrating things like [Carnival in Spain.  
  
  
](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/worlds-best-carnival-celebration-spain-photos-kids-family-travel-fun-adventure-lent-in-andalusia.html "Carnival in Spain")Have you ever traveled during Halloween? What are your Halloween plans this year?

Review - Awesome Luxury!  
  
Wow, what a first class way to  
arrive to Beijing on our first trip  
to China! The Four Seasons Hotel

<!--more--> ![Four Seasons Hotel Beijing arrival opening day](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d4006749f970c.jpg)  
  
Wow, what a first class way to  arrive to [Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/family-travel-beijing-tiananmen-square.html "beijing travel") on our first [trip to China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "trip to china")! The [Four Seasons Hotel Beijing](http://www.fourseasons.com/beijing/ "four seasons hotel beiing") knows just how to spoil and pamper the traveler, family or business person looking for luxury and comfort.

We knew we were off to a great start when they had a [limousine waiting for us at the airport](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/first-limo-ride-a-teens-arrives-in-style-.html "limousine ride") when we arrived. We had the honor to arrive on opening day and the whole exquisite place was brand spanking new and buzzing with excitement. We even met the owner in the elevator.

[Four Seasons Hotels](http://www.fourseasons.com/ "four seasons hotels") are known for their great amenities for families and this new Beijing Four Seasons is no exception. They had a large suite for us and our tween was dancing around our large spacious new "home away from home" full of joy and loved her new Panda waiting for her on the bed.  We had two huge beds, comfortable seating area, gigantic bathroom, and good size desk with outlets for charging electronics.

The view of Beijing was thrilling as we hadn't really known what to expect and it has a lovely energy from this high up. We spent most of our China trip living with locals, but it was really comforting to start our stay in such sumptuous surroundings and opulence.  
  
![Four Seasons Hotel Beijing - our room seating area](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d40068936970c.jpg)  
  
 The highly personalized service and attitude of the staff was outstanding and world class. We had a scrumptious treat for each of us upon arrival. The team at the Executive Club were superb.  
  
We were in Beijing for over a month primarily so our 12 year old daughter could [immerse in Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "immerse in Mandarin in China") and the staff was great about remembering to talk to her only in Chinese which gave her more confidence when we started our city explorations.  
  
![Four Seasons Hotel Beijing - yummy treats](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c35d7abfb970b.jpg)  
  
Nothing like a nice, warm bubble  bath after a long flight and our bathroom was to-die-for with walk in shower, gigantic tub and everything you could possibly need...even kids toothpaste, brush, robe and slippers to match her parents.  
  
![Four Seasons Hotel Beijing - bathroom](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee77b148e970d.jpg)  
  
We got a perfect nights sleep and were ready to explore Beijing the next morning which was clear and crisp with lots of enthusiasm about the Four Seasons opening and government change going on. We felt instantly at home in Beijing which quite surprised me. There is something sophisticated but also  intimate about Beijing despite it's 20 million plus population.

Breakfast was excellent and we loved the huge variety of delicous choices. I was particularly happy there were healthy choices that I could eat.

This was definitely a breakfast for champions and even satisfied my fussy eater who had a blast trying a bit of this and a bit of that.

This was the view out of our room and we enjoyed watching Beijing wake up. Most of the days we were in Beijing the skies were blue and sun shining, so that was a pleasant surprise. November is a great time to be there.

We spent our first three nights in China at the Four Seasons Beijing and the second day The **[Four Seasons concierge](http://www.fourseasons.com/beijing/services_and_amenities/family/)** arranged a perfect tour of city highlights where we saw 3 of it's its six **[UNESCO World Heritage Sites](http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/cn)**.

This gave us a real sense of Beijing in  a quick and easy way with a private guide just for us and a driver who was always there when we needed him to handle the parking and traffic of Beijing seemlessly.

Visiting the Temple of Heaven pictured here, [Forbidden City](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "forbidden city"), the [Summer Palace](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/-summer-palace-sunset-in-beijing-china.html "summer palace") and more of the [best places in Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/best-things-to-do-in-beijing-china-.html "best of beijing"), was quite thrilling for each of us. Both Beijing and  China delights and surprises!

We even got to play a bit of kicking a shuttle cock ( ti jian zi)  with locals in the park and the concierge also set up a [magnificent Peking Duck meal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/peking-duck-in-beijing.html "maginficent Peking duck") for lunch that I will be writing more about.

We loved the traditonal music playing in the hotel when we returned for the day and just walking around this incredibly beautiful space. We met with a few local guests who were also blown away and impressed at this exciting new luxury hotel in an ideal location.

Of course, sometimes, a [digital nomadic family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomad family"), just wants to hang out and this was the perfect place to do that as well and order in some room service. Our daughter watched a little [Chinese TV for language immersion](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/learning-mandarin-in-china-kids-tv-.html "language learning chinese TV"), while we parents caught up with a bit of business via the internet.

Even the elevators were beautiful as my two rascally beloveds demonstrate in this photo.

They were headed off to more endless delectable food! The Executive Club always had mouth watering complementary treats and appetizers waiting and they took plenty advantage of being off our strict health food kick while in China. They also have both a Chinese and Italian restaurant that were fantastic.

This is just the cheese plate in the Executive Club...my favorite part!

Wine tasting is also at its best during [vineyard harvest season](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/grape-harvest-in-europe.html). We prefer "endless summer" with our [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html) [digital nomad lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/11/best-warm-winter-digital-nomad-destinations-.html) exploring Europe's best beach bargains with no crowds and perfect weather. We also love the brilliant colors of autumn.  
  
Here is my top 10 list showing you how and where to do both!  
  
**1) SARANDA, ALBANIA**   
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! Sarande Albania beach paradise ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
  
This September and October we are on the beach in [Saranda, Albania](https://www.visitsaranda.net) which is just a very short boat ride from Corfu, [Greece](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/greece/index.html) and [Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/italy/). I hear it is packed in the summer, but the weather is divine perfection now and we have it almost to ourselves. Interestingly, US citizens may stay in Albania for one year without a residence visa.  
  
This is not necessarily, my number one choice, it's just where we are now & it is perfect for [Schengen Shuffle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/05/what-is-schengen-shuffle-travel-how-to-do-it.html#more)  [Digital Nomad lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html).( Cheap, Fast internet, great weather). Few Americans visit Albania, but it is a great place for luxury bargains, diverse landscapes & wonderful people. Singer [Dua Lipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua_Lipa) is Albanian so vacations here often.

**Weather**  
  
From September to October, the average Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 74 - 83. Which is the perfect temperature to enjoy Saranda's beautiful beaches without crowds or excessive heat. It cools a bit in November, especially at night, but is still mostly sunny. 

**2) METERORA, GREECE**   
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! METEORA GREECE MONASTERIES](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
We did our second summer [nomad stay in Bansko, Bulgaria](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/08/-europes-cheapest-digital-nomad-haven-bansko.html#more) for July and August, then we went to Greece. It is 136 miles or 219 km between Bansko and [Thessaloniki, Greece](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwqAag3M5LU/). The drive only takes about 3 hours. The Autumn season is probably the very best to capture colors and scenes at this unique, Unesco World Heritage site.  
  
 [Meteora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteora) in Greece has been on our bucket list for a long time and it was spectacular. It is the most popular site to see after Athens. Kalambaka and Kastraki are the two closest towns to the stunning Meteora Monasteries with plenty of hotels. We stayed at the beach city of Thessaloniki.No matter where you stay,the best way to experience the Meteora Monasteries is through a guided tour. I will write more about this soon.   
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! meteora Greece ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
  
**Weather  
  
**From September to October, the average Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 72 - 81. It is also the much less crowded and September has the least rain all year. It is cooler in November, in the 60's.   
**3) PLESIVICA, CROATIA   
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! wine tasting vineyard harvests croatia ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)** Vineyards at harvest time and [wine tasting while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/wine-tasting-with-kids.html) is a glorious way to enjoy autumn color. Although the smallest wine region in Croatia, Plešivica is one of the most famous. Known also as Croatian Champagne or Croatian Burgundy, Plešivica has picturesque scenery, tasty food and exciting wines.We visited these beautiful rolling hills last fall, which is less than 30 kilometers southwest of Zagreb.  
  
I will be writing more about this [amazing vineyard](https://www.vinarija-jagunic.com/langid-204)  and more that we have been visiting, including ones near the beach. The microclimate of this region is ideal for vine growing from the hilly terrain and sunlight to a similar soil that is in Champagne.

Weather  
  
**From September to October, the average Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 55 - 78. It was sunny and perfect temperature when we were there in early October. It is much cooler and rainier in November.**  
  
  
4) PERAST, MONTENEGRO  
  
![Europe in Autumn:  10 Best Fall Destinations! Montenegro Unesco Perast Kotor riviera  ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
  
** UNESCO World Heritage Site Perast, [Montenegro](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/montenegrowho-k.html) is one of my favorite places in this world. We first discovered the [Kotor Riviera](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/kotor-riviera.html) in 2007 doing [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html). Last fall we returned again to [Montenegro](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/10/top-instagram-photo-locations-in-kotor-montenegro.html#more) for a couples road trip and long stay. So grateful that Perast had not changed.  
  
Sadly, Cruise ships now have ruined some of this area nearby like Budva and Kotor. I have a lot more to blog about our extensive fall trip to Montenegro and Croatia. It was heavenly and this spot divine. We stayed nearby in a gorgeous large home via airbnb and I will write a review soon.

**Weather  
  
**From September to October, the average Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 68 - 84. It is also the much less crowded and we did not get any rain those months, swam & wore summer clothes. It is cooler in November, in the 60's.   
**  
  
5) UMBRIA, ITALY  
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! umbria   italy vineyard autum colors ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
**Who doesn't love Italy and France? Fall is a great time to visit both and [Umbria is simply stunning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/03/ahhhumbria.html) then. We love short bursts in cities, but much prefer the countryside. [Tuscany](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html) is one of my favorite places. As one rambles along the country roads on crisp autumn mornings, one is mesmerized by the colorful landscape. It often almost feels like one is in a painting!  
  
The food and wine here is also part of the joy. There is so much to explore and love about Italy 

**  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! Umbria wine tasting vineyards at harvest](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
Weather  
  
**From September to October, the average Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 66- 77. It is mostly sunny and warm during the days. It is cooler in November, in the mid 50's. **6) HALLSTATT, AUSTRIA**   
  
**![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! HALLSTATT AUSTRIA STUNNING OCTOBERFEST ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
**[Hallstatt](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/heavenly-hallst.html) is the most beautiful place in Austria in my opinion. Some say it is the most beautiful village in the world. We were there at Octoberfest which made it even more special. Hallstatt is a fairytale village with an ancient history going back more that 7000 years. Cars are banned from May to October every year from 10 am to 5 pm. That just adds to the charm.   
  
Don't miss the views from [the “Beinhaus”](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/salt-mine-iron.html) as the metallic grave stones were charming. We hiked up to the parish church (Pfarrkirche) and its miniscule cemetery, filled with flowers and wrought iron crosses, overlooking the calm lake.**  
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! HALLSTATT ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
Weather  
  
**From September to October, the average Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 43 - 58. If you want to see the brightest leaves, you will be in cooler temperatures. ( Just like one sees more fall color in New England compared to California, although both have change).  It is cooler in November, in the mid 30 or low 40's. **7) BIBINJE, CROATIA   
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! BIBINJE CROATIA ZADAR SUNSETS ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)** [Bibinje](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjqOsc5jogw/) is a small beach town in Croatia near Zadar. Both of these places are known for the best sunsets in the world. We enjoyed spectacular sunset shows daily in both places. The advantage to Bibinje is it is much cheaper and less crowded. We stayed at a place on the beach. So it was super easy to enjoy  these special sunsets.   
  
We stayed in a small airbnb and explored from this base.The crowds go to Zadar for the nightly sunsets, but we preferred having this stunning show all to ourselves.Just like the [world famous Key West sunsets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/world-famous-key-west-sunset.html), these are not to be missed! Another advantages of this small Dalmatian town is the proximity to 5 well-known national parks including [Plitvice Lakes National Park](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/peaceful-pretty.html#more)**  
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! SUNSETS ZADAR BIBINJE ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
  
Weather  
  
**From September to October, the average Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 68 - 76. It was summer like when we were there with no rain, one can swim during the day and no jackets needed. It is cooler in November, in the lower 60's. **  
  
  
8) ROMAN ROAD/ ROTHENBURG, GERMANY  
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! ROMAN ROAD GERMANY ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)  
**[The Romantic Road](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/family-travel-germany-rothenberg-beautiful-architectural-details-romantic-road.html) was a trade route during the middle ages and still retains the same charm of that time as it weaves along the western border of Bavaria. We delighted in discovering so many beautiful sites [](http://www.romanticroad.com/)during our stay in this area in October (after the masses of tourists have gone home)**.**  
We happen to come upon this surreal scene in beautiful [Rothenburg ob der Tauber,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/01/family-travel-photorothenberg-germany.html) Germany one fall day when all the tourists were gone and the locals were having a medieval festival. We were [camping](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/rv-in-europe-road-trip-europe-camping-european-style.html) in our van there for a few weeks and loved this village. It is on the Romantic Road and we had a magical day!**

Weather  
  
**From September to October, the averag e Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 66 - 71. It was warm enough to camp, but jackets and fall clothes needed.  It is cooler in November, in the 50's. **9) BURGUNDY, FRANCE   
  
![Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations! BURGUNDY FRANCE VINEYARDS COLOR ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)**   
 If you love pinot noir wine you will [love Burgundy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/the-heart-of-bu.html) in the fall. We put in a boutique pinot organic vineyard the year our daughter [Heavenly](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com) was born. So she grew up loving vineyards. I've always loved this arty photo of her looking at the vineyards in Burgundy from our campsite.   
  
Don't miss driving the famous [Route des Grands Crus](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/route-des-grand.html) on [undulating small roads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/wine-roads-bacc.html) thru scarlet & golden colored, vine covered country side and beautiful quaint ancient towns. We actually rarely drink ( wine or anything) but we do so love vineyards.**

**From September to October, the average Fahrenheit temperature ranges between 68 - 72. Mostly sunny and crisp when we were there.  It is cooler in November, in the 50's. **10) SAINT-EMILION, FRANCE

Stunning Saint-Émilion  France bordeaux wine vineyards ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d399317f200c-2048x1291-1.jpg)** A stunning area of [France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/france/index.html), filled with surprises, we thoroughly enjoyed our time in Bordeaux, the wine capital of the world! Absolutely perfect for family travel or [couples travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/03/retirement-traveling-around-the-world.html), with something for everyone. We were based in [St Emilion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/stunning-saint-émilion-france.html),   [a UNESCO World Heritage Site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/932), with it's charming, medieval old town, vineyards all around and underground galleries plus catacombs.  
  
The 4 star luxury campsite, [Domaine De La Barbanne](https://www.camping-saint-emilion.com/en/), was one of our favorites in Europe, nestled in the heart of Saint-Emilion's world class vineyards. Saint Emilion is by far the prettiest French town in the Bordeaux region of France. It is a perfect base for a bike holiday or [France vineyards cycling vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/biking-st-emilion-bordeaux-vineyards-in-france-wine-country.html "France vineyards cycling vacation") like we did as a family.

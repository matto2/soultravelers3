I had promised Mozart that we would go for a swim after we returned from our day trip to Ronda. She had been chomping at the bit since we arrived to get into one of the many pools and hot tubs. She could run off a little steam while everyone else rested a little.

So we dashed off in time for a little sand play at the beach first, to watch the sun set with Africa and Gibraltar in the far distance. It was very pretty and peaceful and we had the beach all to ourselves. We saw very few people during our entire stay at the resort so it must not have been very busy. I have no idea what it is like in high season, but we enjoyed the serenity.

Mozart was enthused by her swim in the indoor pool. I was going to let her swim by herself but she can be an adventurousÂ  kid, so I thought I better get in too in order to keep her safe. Then we headed into one of several outdoor hot tubs and soaked under the moonlight.

We washed off in the shower and I shampooed her hair and then put her right into her jammies for the walk back to our unit. There was a nice meal waiting for us in our room and we all hit the sack afterwards since we knew we had a busy day planned with an early start.

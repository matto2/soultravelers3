During our many years of [road trips around Europe](During our many years of road trips around Europe, we've managed to find some  "road trips around Europe"), we've managed to find some of the [best European vacation spots](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Best European vacation spots") to explore and relax luxuriously on a low budget and [Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/family-travel-provence-france-narbonne.html "Provence travel") is one of our favorite areas that we return to regularly. I love this photo, don't you? Brings back happy memories!  
  
[Arles, France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-arles-france-.html "Arles, France") is a gem for it's UNESCO World Heritage Roman arena, charm and connections with Van Gogh and Gaugin, not to mention the amazing nearby [Camargue](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html "Camargue travel"). They still have French-style bull fights in this arena. We are huge fans of [Van Gogh](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/van-gogh.html "Van Gogh") and he created about 300 paintings and drawings while he lived in Arles in the late 1880's. Many of the places and things he painted there can still be seen which adds to the magic.  
  
Arles is only about an hour from the [Cote d'Azur](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/around-the-world-with-kids-extended-travel-long-term-travel-families-and-friends.html "cote d'azur") and I really enjoy how the different towns in [southern France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-southern-france-uzes-provence-near-pont-du-gard-photography-europe-window.html "southern france") all seem to have their own unique flavor. It takes many long-stay visits to get to know them well and as much as we have seen, there are still many more I want to explore or return to.  
  
Once Mozart is [fluent-as-a-native inÂ  Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/mandarin-chinese-learning-at-home-and-abroad.html "fluent in mandarin") she wants to learn French next ( which should be fairly easy for her since she is so [fluent in Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "fluent in spanish via school in spain")), so we've been dreaming about where we will do our long stay in southern France to immerse in the lovely language. Why not Arles or some place in Provence, eh?

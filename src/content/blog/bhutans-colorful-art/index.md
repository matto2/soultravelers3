One of the great joys of [visiting Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/stunning-himalaya-travel-bhutan.html "visiting Bhutan"), an exotic kingdom in the midst of the Himalayas, is enjoying the culture and colorful art. This pristine and deeply Buddhist land is no ordinary place. Daily prayer is a constant part of life, traditional clothing ( a tunic called [gho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gho "Gho") for men and kera for women ) is worn at work and school, [breathtaking scenery](breathtaking scenery surrounds you "Bhutan breathtaking scenery") surrounds you, and the unique Bhutanese architecture plus the [phallic art](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/bhutan-means-penis-art-and-phallus-paintings.html "Bhutan penis art") is like no where else on earth.  
  
I love the bright colors of the art, like in this Buddha mural made of cloth. It is such a contrast to the earthy shades of nature that envelopes you there. Art is just part of life in Bhutan,Â  as every building, every house, every temple is a hand-painted work of art.

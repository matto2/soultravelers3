In Asia or the USA, people  
seem shocked to see a blonde  
girl sing or speak Chinese, so Mozart

In [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/asia/ "Asia travel") or the USA, people seem shocked to see a blonde girl sing or [speak Chinese](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent in Mandarin"), so [Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "mozart beautiful teen singer, songwriter trilingual ") is used to that by now. She is grateful to be a [bridge between cultures](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/china-bridge-summer-palace.html "Mozart is bridge between two cultures China and America"). Her [Youtube fans](https://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "Soultravelers3 youtube") have been requesting that [she sing in Mandarin](https://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "Teen singer Mozart singing in Mandarin"), so here it is:

It was a thrill for her that her very first paid singing gig was in Asia, when she was twelve, singing in [Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "Mozart's Mandarin ted talk") at a big traditional Chinese wedding.

Then, when we arrived in Dallas from Asia, there was a spring festival in the local Chinatown and Mozart sang there for a large crowd.

 Interestingly, it was very close to where we randomly picked to live.

In some ways it was startling deja vu for us, having just left Asia....

.....that suddenly, in the middle of Dallas, we were instantly back in Asia.

It looked like a typical, Dallas or USA mall, until you saw the lettering everywhere and noticed everyone was Asian and the statues, decorations and such were all Asian.

Suddenly, we knew where to get the Chinese news in Dallas....

....and where to find Chinese cultural opportunities.

[The Dallas Chinese Community Center](http://www.dallasccc.org/ "the dallas chinese community center") sponsored this festival I believe and hosts events year round, so Mozart will likely sing again there.  
  
Mozart writes songs in Mandarin, Spanish and English and knows some Mandarin Pop songs as well. ( She was the youngest finalist in a singing contest at 12 in her 1000-kid Chinese school in Asia which is part of what gave us a heads up to this passion of hers).

We enjoyed the food and activities too after she sang.

It was lovely to connect with the Chinese community in Dallas. There seem to be many people here from both Beijing and Taiwan, so thankfully, Mozart has people to talk to in Chinese!  
  
We want to thank [Mandarin teacher Tracy Lin](http://www.mymandarinchinese.com/mandarintutor.php "mandarin teacher dallas"), who has been exceptionally nice and helpful to us.

It was also interesting to see how far Mozart has come with her singing in this short time period. Here is a clip from a performance last week at the House of Blues. [http://instagram.com/p/txud05tqug/](http://t.co/l7AnmgncSp "http://instagram.com/p/txud05tqug/")   
  
If you're in Dallas, don't miss her on Friday, October 10th at the [Opening Bell Coffee House](http://www.openingbellcoffee.com/ "opening bell coffee house") at 10pm!

The sun has been worshipped by many cultures for eons due to it's healing benefits and therapuetic powers. Yet, we've all been so corporate-media drenched with information about the harms of the sun, that it is easy to forget that there are so [many healing benefits from the sun](http://drbenkim.com/vitamin-d-facts.htm "many healing benefits from the sun").  
  
Every one does seem to agree that sun burning is harmful and that [sun healing](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/03/26/maximizing-vitamin-d-exposure.aspx "sun healing benefits") must be done with moderation and thoughtfulness. In all my recent research on [travel and health](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel and health") and [eating healthy food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "eating healthy food"), I keep coming across recommendations about getting some sun daily or even [sun gazing](http://solarhealing.com/solarlinks/ "sun gazing") and thankfully, [tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical Asia") is an easy place to do this year round.

Today there is an [epidemic of people with low Vt D](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/11/01/Vitamin-D-is-a-Key-Player-in-Your-Overall-Health.aspx "epidemic of low vitamin D") and 75% or more of American teens and adults are deficient in vitamin D. I was very surprised to discover through a recent  blood test in California, that  I was one (because I have a year round slight suntan since I get some just by walking outside in sunny places),  although I never purposely tan and rarely go out in the sun during the hottest hours. Older people, over weight people, Hispanic and Blacks are at a much higher risk for low Vt D that can cause all kinds of degenerative diseases from Cancer to Osteoporosis.

  
Some of the health problems you may suffer if you don't get enough vitamin D from the sun:  
  
1) Breast cancer  
2) Tooth Decay and Periodontal disease  
3) Diabetes  
4)Colon cancer  
5) Ovarian cancer  
6) Osteoporosis  
7) High blood pressure  
8) Heart Disease  
9) Multiple Sclerosis  
10) Prostate cancer  
11) Psoriasis  
12) Tuberculosis  
13) Rickets

Some say [sunscreen is dangerous](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2003/07/02/sunblock-cancer-part-one.aspx "sunscreen is dangerous") and give you cancer instead of protect you, so it's something we rarely use. Luckily Mozart has the skin type that never burns ( more like her Dad and blond Aunt Julie, than her fairer, freckled Mom), so we just usually use shade in the strong sun hours. I got a minor skin cancer in my 30's ( most likely from a childhood bad burn) which makes me very aware of the dangers.  
  
I can't find Vt D here in Penang and have run out, so I am purposely getting sun now. At first I was doing it for 15 minutes a day on my terrace in the early morning, but I've since read that even in tropical climates, it's best to get your dialy 10/15 minutes around noon. Thus, I will try that for a while and hopefully find some lab here where I can keep an eye on my Vitamin D level. Some call it an essential hormone rather than a vitamin. I will never "bake" in it like some of those deeply brown tanned folks we see in Europe, but I am up for using this natural remedy to boost our health.  
  
What do you think..sun or no sun?

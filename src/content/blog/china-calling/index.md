Okay, I couldn't resist asking and taking advantage of this pagoda phone opportunity, ( at the [Summer Palace](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/-summer-palace-sunset-in-beijing-china.html "summer palace, china travel ")), but it is an important question in today's world where many say it is the [Asian Century.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Asian century - why learn mandarin")  
  
My husband and I never thought we'd ever [go to China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/beautiful-china.html "go to china"), nor did I think I'd [raise a trilingual](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "how to raise a trilingual") who could [speak, read and write Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "speak, reading and writing in multilanguages"). We grew up during the cold war, so constantly bombarded with ominous

One doesn't really realize these prejudices that impact. I found I had the same kind of below-conscious level prejudices with countries in the [Middle East](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/people-of-jordan.html "middle east - people of Jordan travel") and [Morocco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/morocco/page/2/ "Morocco") too. They made us a bit fearful and less interested in visiting these countries. Surprisingly, when we did go, we found ourselves enjoying these places and people perhaps more than others. Partly, I think because they broke up some of our crystalizations about what we thought was true.

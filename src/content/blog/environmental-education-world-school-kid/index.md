Is environmental education and ecological literacy for creating a sustainable world important for today's student? Can eco ed, green kids change the world? Our [homeschooled](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschooled") and [world schooled](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world schooled") 11 year old [eco-friendly child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/family-travel-photohappy-earth-day.html "eco friendly child") has a passion for environmental issues, ( probably learned much through our real [world traveling lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "world traveling lifestyle") on 5 continents and [minimalist style](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist style")). So she was thrilled to have won the opportunity to speak at the Earth Hour celebrations at her [Mandarin school in Asia,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "mandarin school in asia") reading a powerful poem in front of thousands.

I am proud of her interest in this important topic and gifts as a public speaker to move and inspire others. Last year she won the [English Elocution contest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "English elocution contest") giving a speech she wrote about taking care of the environment, ( we returned too late for her to enter this year)  but this environmental poem assignment they gave to many students in the 1000 kid high school to compete to read it and she and a 16 year old boy from Indonesia  happily won the spots for public speaking.

I am also proud of the effort that the school puts into environmental education. They put a lot of work into creating a lovely program for Earth Day and Earth Hour.

The kids are from Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, China, Malaysia ( and our lone Caucasian kidlet) and the school is in the developing world, so it's gratifying to see this important environmental message valued and passed on to all the children.

Malaysia is a three culture country, due to it's rich history with kids and teachers at the school from many different religious backgrounds as well. Yet, everyone was included.

Mozart looks a bit nervous just before she goes on the stage, but she actually loves public speaking or singing, despite any butterflies. She has actually been like that from babyhood. Last year she sang a solo on Earth Day before thousands without ever having sung in public before.

Do you believe in environmental education? What ways do you or your school help kids of all ages become greener and more aware of our limited resources on our beloved planet? Will eco educated kids help heal our world? How can we support them?

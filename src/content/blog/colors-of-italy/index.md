August 18, 2008

I love the colors of the Mediterranean  
in summer and none are more  
beautiful than Italy! Everywhere

  I love the colors of the Mediterranean in summer and none are more beautiful than Italy! Everywhere you look from the buildings to the umbrellas and fruit, the bright colors of [Italy](http://www.jaunted.com/browse/Europe/it) can't help but make one smile.

 I found myself humming joyful Italian songs that I could not name that some how stole into my consciousness through movies, operas, maybe even cartoons. Always robust, happy songs that reflect the earthy beauty that shines in so many little ways all over Italy in unsuspected, everyday places.

Just as pizza has traveled the world, it seems everyone has a little Italian in them. France, Spain and [Italy](http://www.concierge.com/tools/travelawards/readerschoice/cities) are [the most popular destinations](http://www.boston.com/travel/getaways/europe/articles/2007/09/16/even_off_season_italy_is_a_hot_destination/) in Europe for Americans and deservedly so. This is [our fourth stop](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/more-fabulous-f.html) in [Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/roma.html) on our [world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/12/where-in-heaven.html) and we will add at least one more on our way back to Spain this fall.

 I never tire of it and feel a bond with this country because I once lived here long ago. It is hard to believe now, but I lived in [Milano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan) as a young girl to model ( for [Ford Models](http://www.fordmodels.com/)) and a part of my heart has never left Italy. It always feels like I am coming home to Italy.

It is one of my many "homes" around the world, as [Spain](http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_spain.html) has also become, because of this trip. I am grateful that Mozart also gets to have [much of Europe](http://www.concierge.com/travelguide/europe) as "homes" for her forever. She has spent enough time here in the last three years that they are a part of her.

She is an [American girl](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/suite-bon-voyag.html) who is also [part European](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3), part [Moroccan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/12/sahara-dream.html#more) and [part Turkish](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/kalehan-kindred.html). Slow travel does not allow one to be a true foreigner or tourist, but become one with the places visited in many ways, allowing time and people to melt the differences away.

We will not forget the many colors of Italy, especially in summer, which suits it so well. Here are a few random photos from our latest forays into the [Italian Riviera](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/7-best-reasons-to-travel-cinque-terre-italy.html) and our [return](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/romeo-juliet-in.html) to one of it's prettiest small cities, [Verona.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona)

It is not always the big things, sometimes, it is the avalanche of little things that has an impact that binds one to a place. The sound of Italian, the food, the creativity, the way life is lived as art. The beauty of Italy, in all the millions of little ways, makes my heart sing!

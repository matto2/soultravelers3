the Sahara thanks to the loving people we met  
there and the awe inspiring, simple beauty.

We had a very profound, spiritual experience in the Sahara thanks to the loving people we met there and the awe inspiring, simple beauty.

This is our video of our experience, read more about it [here](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html), [here](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/sahara-violin-c.html) and [here](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/nomad-berber-li.html).

Please subscribe to our [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3) to see our videos first. We post all of our videos on Youtube first until we have time to get them on our website.

Our daughter Mozart, who was just 6, rode in on a camel and gave a violin concert to 60 welcoming young Berber children which was a highlight for us and we shared some of that in our video "Where in Heaven is Mozart?". We bought some healthy food for them afterwards and Mozart had a great time playing with them despite the language differences. We were greeted with sunshine and a very rare, magical rainbow as we headed into the dazzling Merzouga dunes for our private camel trek and overnight in a nomad tent under the stars in the Sahara. We were honored to get to visit with some of the nomad families and get a taste of their graciousness, good food and hospitality. We owe a special thanks to Allesandra & Hmad of Les Nomades who are amazing people who helped us create this special life changing and authentic experience. We HIGHLY recommend them:

Thanks to Mathew Marsolek for the soulful song that is a sanskrit prayer and reminded us of our hauntingly beautiful experience in Morocco:

**TIME TOGETHER - THE BEST GIFT**  
  
Time is the very best gift one can give to a child. Time to [play](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/05/the-importance-of-play-in-learning.html "importance of play in learning") and [learn](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/learning-while-traveling-travel-homeschool-road-school-abroad-5-best-reasons.html "learning while traveling road school") and [explore](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/france-with-kids-exploring-provence.html "explore france") and [hug](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/hugging-aphrodi.html "hugging aphrodite") together. Since we have been on our [RTW trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world trip"), we have had to [mourn on the road](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "mourning and travel") and [say good bye to our own precious dads](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/good-bye-dad-grandpa-family-death-afar-while-traveling-abroad.html "saying good bye to dad and grandpa"), so we know what it is like to be fatherless on [Father's Day](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/fathers-day-weekend-trips-or-family-international-travel-.html "Father's Day"). Childhood years go by so fast and the parental relationships shapes us forever. Most experts say the father-daughter relationship effects a females entire future.  
  
"I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection." - Sigmund Freud

**RISKING ALL TO LIVE THE DREAM**  
  
One of the joys of being an older parent, is maturity and being aware of the speed of life, thus one of our main purposes of [world travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "best reasons for a world trip") is to have time together. We waited almost a decade to have a child after [marrying late](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "celebrating wedding anniversary in paris") and we didn't want to miss a second.  
  
![Backpacking dad and daughter exploring Paris at night](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901d55baa8970b.jpg)  
  
We both always wanted a daughter and we wanted to raise her in a loving, peaceful home with two supportive, involved, connected parents who cherished the value of family. We think one can actually add to [world peace](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/world-peace-love-and-happiness.html "world peace") for generations by raising a deeply loved and supported child, so take this sacred family bond seriously.

"A father who has a good relationship with the mother of their children is more likely to be involved and to spend time with their children and to have children who are psychologically and emotionally healthier. Similarly, a mother who feels affirmed by her children's father and who enjoys the benefits of a happy relationship is more likely to be a better mother." Wilcox Bradford

**MEN'S MOST COMMON DEATH BED REGRETS**  
  
What could be more important? On their death beds, nobody wishes they spent more time working, but almost all dying men [regret working too much](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying "death regrets - working too much") and not spending time with their children and loved ones.  
  
"Involved fathers bring positive benefits to their children that no other person is as likely to bring" Dr. David Popenoe

**FAMILY TIME MOTIVATES A WORLD TRAVEL LIFESTYLE**  
  
When our daughter was born, DaVinci took two months off of unpaid leave from his high-end executive job in Silicon Valley so we'd have time to babymoon together. That was unheard of for a woman, so shocking for a male to his boss and peers. But that was perhaps the seed that gave us the impetus to take on our [world travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "world travel lifestyle") because it felt so right and wonderful to have that much time to enjoy the gift of parenting and deep family bonding without worrying about work duties. It was idyllic so we wanted more.

**WORK - LIFE BALANCE FOR FATHERS**  
  
After months of sacred closeness together, we felt a huge difference when he went back to work, often leaving before she woke up and returning when she was asleep, so only seeing her on the weekends. Sometimes we went to work with him so we could do things together like Gymboree or swimming before work or visiting the zoo or museum at lunch time.  
  
We wanted and deserved more. He didn't become a father to see his child so rarely. So we plotted a dream life fantasy where we [sold our much loved home](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "sold our dream home") and almost [all of our belongings](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalism"), retired early to [travel the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "travel the world .amazing") together, to [educate her](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschool and travel") as a fluent-as-a-native  [multilingual](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "multilingual learning") [global kid](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "global kid") and enjoy "24/7" time together each and every day of her childhood.

**WHY NOT A STAY AT HOME DAD AND MOM?**  
  
Truly, it was the best decision of our lives and one of the reasons is the quality of time we have together. We didn't want him to be a dad who missed this quantity of time. He is a stay-at-home-Dad and I am a stay-at-home-Mom...only we do it in [many homes around the world.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "friends on the ultimate family adventure travel life") She was a long term breast fed kid, so she is a bit of a Mama's girl, but her relationship and attachment with her Dad is outstanding too. She has had more time with her Dad and Mom than almost any kid on this planet. Perhaps we are giving her the dream childhood we always wanted and it heals each of us.

**AN IDEAL FATHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP**  
  
She thinks that is normal, because it IS her normal. But we parents are especially [grateful](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/12/grace-gratitude.html "grace and gratitude") for this bond of [endless summer](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/endless-summer-joy-of-tropical-winter-travel.html "ENDLESS SUMMER") time together. It is the greatest gift of this [RTW journey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "around the world family travel"). I would have been a stay-at- home Mom had we stayed, but by going, we allowed HIM to have that blessing as well. Thier father daughter relationship would have still been fabulous, but time at work would have eaten away at their time together and so much would have been missed.

**CHOOSING FREEDOM**  
  
We enjoy watching our home movies often on our travels and I took a LOT during babyhood and preschool years, so that I could share her days with him when he was working, but it is just not the same as having the time and freedom together.

Recently DaVinci turned 60 and Mozart is 12 now and these recent photos were taken during our little family, "[simple pleasures"](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/lifes-simple-pleasures.html "simple pleasures") [birthday celebration](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/celebrating-in.html "birthday celebration") in our latest [Penang apartment](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/penang-apartment-or-condo-rental-plenty-of-choices.html "Penang apartment rental") home. These kinds of age milestones, make us even more grateful for our choice of a life of quality AND quantity time together. The days and years have zipped by and are slippping through our fingers as we age and she gets older.

**THE POWER OF THE FATHER DAUGHTER BOND**  
  
Many people might not want a 24/7/365 kind of family togetherness, but it suits all of us to a T.  Mozart and DaVinci  could never have had this kind of father -daughter time, had we not decided to travel and retire early. For us, giving up [over consumerism](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "over consumerism") for time, freedom, relationships, [education](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html/ "education at it's best .world school") and adventure has worked well. We didn't know that for sure when we sold our home in 2005, but we know it now, so we are overjoyed that we took that risk.

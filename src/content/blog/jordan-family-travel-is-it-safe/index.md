As you can tell by this photo  
at Petra, our child had a blast  
in Jordan as did our whole family.

As you can tell by this [photo at Petra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra "photo at petra"), our child had a blast in Jordan as did our whole family. Is [Jordan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan") a fun, educational and safe place for a family holiday or family vacation in the Middle East? Absolutely!  
  
As you might know, we have done [violin vignettes in iconic places on our world tour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4 "viral travel youtube video") to 42 countries on 5 continents so far, and our 10 year decided that doing her violin on top of a camel at the Treasury in Petra dressed in traditional Bedouin clothes was a fabulous idea...and we agreed! She had a ball and we got some fabulous photos and video ( much more coming soon!). Jordan has  been a favorite country for the our entire family.  
  
Today we are back to the [beautiful Dead Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_sea "Dead Sea") where we started our family friendly journey 10 days ago in Jordan and tomorrow we head back to Spain where we will explore Europe for the summer months.  The [Movenpick Resort here at the Dead Sea](http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/your_hotels/worldmap/dead_sea/overview.cfm "Movenpick Dead Sea Resort") is a perfect spot to relax and begin or end a family vacation in Jordan.  
  
Jordan is called the "Peaceful Oasis of the Middle East"  or the neutral  "Switzerland of the Middle East" and it lives up to this reputation. I've been to Egypt and Israel before, but found Jordan an exceptionally peaceful place. The Jordan people are renown for their hospitality and generosity and they helped make our visit a delight. We were very honored to be the first family travel bloggers to be invited to explore this country sponsored by [Jordan's Tourism Board](http://www.visitjordan.com/ "Jordan Tourism Board")  Everybody involved made our trip smooth and easy and we really enjoyed our guide Saleh and driver Samer as well as meeting the beautiful and smart Halla and Reine. More details about them soon.  
  
One of the things that surprised us about Jordan is just how diverse it is and easy to access many very different experiences in short spaces of time. We experienced budget options, eco friendly places, and top of the line luxury resorts, so there is something for everyone. The food every where is scrumptious, we went boating in the Red Sea near Israel, Egpyt and Saudi Arabia, camel riding in awesome Petra, 4x4 exploring in unique Wadi Rum, toured amazing Christian biblical sites, kidlet baked chocolate chip cookies with the top Pastry Chef at the [Four Seasons Amman](http://www.fourseasons.com/amman/ "Four Seasons Hotel Amman") and we were amazed to find out that Jordan has over 50 THOUSAND archaeological sites. ( To name just a few of the delights here).

[Planning a trip to Spai](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "planning a trip to spain")n? Having seen more of [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/family-travel-spain-photo-andalusia.html "spain travel") than most Spaniards I have the ultimate [checklist](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html "How to rent a vacation home in spain") for you!  
  
**1) DON'T MISS ANDALUCIA, BUT SEE IT IN FALL, SPRING OR WINTER**  
  
![Best tips for Andalusia, Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6f68f59970b.png)  
  
[Southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/southern-spain-cave-houses.html "southern Spain cave houses") is quintessential [Spain,](http://soultravelers3new.local/spain/ "Spain travel tips") ( and one of [our homes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "travel tips for costa del sol in spain") after 6 years of [wintering](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "How to winter in Spain") there) but do like the Spaniards do and head to [green northern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/post-1.html "green northern spain") during the summer months when [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html "Andalusia - Easter procession, semana santa") fries in the hot sun.  
  
![barcelona - Gaudi's Sagrada Familia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d08096c9970c.png)  
  
  
**2) GAUDI IN BARCELONA**  
  
So much to love in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "travel to Barcelona and costa brava"), one of the [top destinations in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/best-places-to-visit-in-europe.html "top destinations to visit in Europe"),  but [Gaudi](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/more-gaudi-wond.html "Gaudi wonders in Barcelona") is Spain's most famous architect and his unique, distinctive style gives [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/best-catalan-food-in-barcelona.html "Barcelona - best catalan food") it's creative Catalan character through his artistic, unusual buildings and designs. Even people not into architecture, follow the [Gaudi trail](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/gaudis-sagrada.html "Gaudi trail ") in Barcelona and are amazed.  
  
![Horse Fair Jerez Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6f60207970b.png)  
  
  
**3) DON'T MISS THE HORSE FAIR IN JEREZ**  
  
[Jerez](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/joys-of-the-roa.html "Jerez spain horse fair") is famous for [sherry, horses](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/horses-and-sher.html "Jerez horse and sherry") and flamenco and you can catch all of this at it's most delightful best during the annual [Jerez](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/jerez-lunch.html "Jerez best food in spain") Horse Fair (Feria de Caballo) which is the most prestigious equine heritage event in all of [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Best european family vacations"). This is one of the biggest street parties in Spain ( and these people KNOW how to party) highlighted by the gorgeous clothes and magnificent dancing Andalusian horses performed by the world famous Royal Equestrian School of Art.  
  
  
  
![GUGGENHEIM IN BILBAO, Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb079bb6ea970d.png)  
  
**4) GUGGENHEIM IN BILBAO**  
  
This stunning titanium masterpiece, that is the world famous [Museo Guggenheim](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/wow-guggenheim-bilbao-.html "guggenheim in Bilbao spain review"), absolutely lives up to the hype and still impresses in person, no matter how many pictures you might have seen. It is also one of the most fun museums for [family travel](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/09/travel/frugal-traveler-food-too-is-an-art-in-bilbao.html)! Even for non architecture fans, one can instantly see why it has been called the most important structure of it's time.

The large pieces ( like [Richard Serra's massive steel sculptures](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2005/jun/22/art), [Jeff Koon's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Koons) colorful [huge Tulip bouquet](http://www.guggenheim.org/bilbao) on a back deck area and Louise Bourgeois' gigantic [mother spider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maman) ) interact with the building and landscape in a whimsical way that is provocative, plus there is an [amazing playground](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/-best-playground-in-europe-guggenheim-in-bilbao-spain-more.html "best playground in europe") next to it and [Bilbao](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/basque-folk-dancing-in-bilbao-spain.html "Bilbao spain and basque dancing") is a unique Spanish city.  
  
![Madrid- The Plaza Mayor ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d08002a5970c.png)  
  
**5) MADRID**  
  
[Madrid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/taste-of-madrid.html "madrid visiting tips"), Spain's elegant capital is known for having the best night life in Europe and possibly the world. The food is [exquisite](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/botin-restauran.html "food in Madrid like Biotin restaurant") as are it's art museums like the [Prado,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/prado-play.html "Visiting Prado in Madrid with kids") one of the most important museums in the world and without a doubt the pride of Spain.  
  
![Vist Granada and Alhambra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb079bb30d970d.png)  
  
**6) GRANADA - ALHAMBRA**  
  
Granada's [Alhambra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/la-alhambra.html "Alhambra in Granada travel "), a [breathtaking Moorish palace](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/-alhambra-moorish-palace-in-granada-with-gypsy-guitar.html "moorish palace and gypsy guitar") and garden, is the most visited sight in [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/travel-to-spain-kids-tips.html "travel to spain") and one of [Europe's top attractions](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Best European vacations").  It dates back to the ninth century and it is  considered a masterpiece of world architecture. [Granada](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/grace-gratitude.html "visiting granada") is one of our favorite Spanish cities for it's [skiiing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/skiing-in-southern-spain.html "skiing in southern spain"), churches, [flamenco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/flamenco.html "flamenco in spain"), [camping](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/camping-spain.html "camping spain"), gypsies, [spas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/ahh-arab-baths-andalusia-spa-malaga-granada-benalmedena-massage-hotspringsthemal-water-roman.html "arab baths and spas in southern spain"), beauty and more.  
  
![Galicia Spain - go explore!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6f68b87970b.png)  
  
  
**7) GALICIA - CAMINO PILGRIM OR NOT**  
  
[Galicia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/gorgeous-galici.html "galica travel tips") is much more than just [amazing Santiago de Compostela](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/santiago-de-com.html "santiago de compestella tips") and it really blew our minds, as it is one of the most [spectacularly beautifu](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/more-galician-b.html "galicia spain tips")l areas in Europe!  
  

<iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TnqpoELmDbM?list=UUcMwuQFsEJfOct29ZTa0v8w" width="640"></iframe>

  
  
It is very pristine and not crowded, as few seem to be aware of how much [startling beauty](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03EFDB143EF934A15757C0A961958260) is here. Summer is the time to visit as it is rainy most of the year.  
  
![Seville  - prettiest city in the world?](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0800926970c.png)  
  
  
**8 ) SEVILLE - STUNNING AND SUBLIME**  
  
We just totally fell in love with [Sevilla](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/ole-sublime-sev.html "seville - prettiest city") as it was one of the most beautiful cities I have ever seen. I was surprised It was so enchanting, sophisticated, alive and original that I was just in awe. I have to agree with the famous poet, Antonio Gala, who once said: "The issue is not that Sevillians think they live in the most beautiful place on Earth... even worst, is the fact that they may be right in thinking so". Don't miss the [Flamenco in Seville](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/flamenco-in-sev.html "flamenco in seville, where to see it best") and everyone should experience the world famous [Semana Santa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/semana-santa-in.html "semana santa in seville is world famous") here.  
  
  
![Visiting San Sebastian Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6f68bfe970b.png)  
  
  
  
**9) SAN SEBASTIAN OR DONOSTIA**  
  
 [Food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/food-shopping-san-sebastian-spain-unusual-markets-europe.html "food shopping in San Sebastian") is [what this city](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2005/mar/13/foodanddrink.shopping2) and beach resort is about. There are as many [highest rated  restaurants](http://epicureanways.com/comments/spain-scores-high-on-worlds-50-best-restaurants-list/) in [San Sebastian](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/seaside-resort-san-sebastian-spain-donostia.html "San sebastian travel tips") as either Madrid or Barcelona - cities that are almost 20 times larger! June is ideal, when the weather is good ( it has cold,  rainy winters) but the crowds have not arrived yet ( the entire Spanish government moves from Madrid to San Sebastian in July and August). Don't miss the [pintxos and sidra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/san-sebastian-tapas-pintxos-pinchos-spain-best-basque-food-for-foodies-vacation-.html "basque food in san sebastian tapas")!  
  
![La Mezquita in Cordoba spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb079bb160970d.png)  
  
  
**10) CORDOBA AND  LA MEZQUITA**  
  
Charming [Cordoba](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/cordoba.html "visit cordoba spain") is smaller than it's Andalus ian counterparts Seville and Granada, but once was one of the greatest cities in the medieval world. So much to [savor](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/el-caballo-rojo.html "Cordoba spain where to eat"), but one MUST visit [La Mezquita](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/la-mezquita.html "La Mezquita in Cordoba, why go"), it's greatest glory. This sacred massive mosque, built in the 8th century,  covering several square acres, is simply indescribable and astonishing. It is one of those you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it kind of places. No pictures can ever do justice to the experience and it is one that should not be missed. A temple in Roman times, now a Catholic church with daily mass, where most of the architecture is Islamic, built by the Moors!  
  
This is just the tip of the iceberg of all the wonders of Spain and few can see this in one trip, but this country is worth exploring and getting to know deeply! Any questions about travel to Spain?

Happy Easter! Happy Spring! Happy Passover! California is different. We're lucky that our church holds their Easter Service on the beach in Santa Monica and open to all and we've been going when we can for the last 30 years.

Southern California tends to have perfect spring weather at Easter, but this one seemed even more glorious.

I started going to this Easter event before I married my husband almost 27 years ago and it seems like yesterday that Mozart was one of the little ones doing the Easter Egg hunt with the Easter Bunny. She was only 6 months old the first time she came to this event.

 But this year she is one of the teens and she sang an Easter version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah.

 I love it that the surfers and beach scene went on as normal while we held a church service right in the middle of it and open to all. Hope you had a great day and enjoying your spring break!

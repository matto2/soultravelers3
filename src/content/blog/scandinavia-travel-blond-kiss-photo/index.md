When you take a trip to or vacation in [Scandinavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "scandinavia"), one thing you can not miss is all the [blondes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde "blond or blonde")! In most places, blondes are a rarity, but in Scandinavia they are every where you look. "Tow heads" as my mother use to call us when we were kids.  
  
I have a whole collection of blondes that I took photos of while we visited Scandinavia..in [Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-sweden-stockholm-harbor-boats.html "stockholm, sweden"), [Norway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/family-travel-photo-norway-in-a-nutshell-fijords-europe-roadtrip-budget-cheap-flam-train-vacation-.html "Norway Fjords"), [Denmark](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/family-travel-photodenmark-copenhagen-tivoli-gardens-royal-danish-guard-parade-boys-drumming.html "Denmark") and [Finland](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-finland-books-library-travel-with-kids-homeschool.html "family travel finland"). Some day I will have to make aÂ  photo post or video with them.  
  
Sometimes [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "around the world family trip") is just observing people in a different culture enjoy their every day lives. This couple, obviously newly in love, greeted each other with a morning kiss as they passed on the street in front of me. Some how it captured a slice of Scandinavia for me. There was something sweet about this kiss on the street.  
  
We've recently enjoyed the many dark haired [hues of Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "colors of asia") and the Middle East, but it's also wonderful to be back in Europe to delight in the many different cultures here.  
  
Is it just me who enjoys the look of beautiful blond hair? Have you been to Scandinavia? Do you think it's funny that some blondes dye their hair black in Scandinavia to look different?

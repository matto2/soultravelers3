What Your Fourth Grader Needs to Know  
We love these books as a good homeschool guide and Mozart loves to read them just for fun. The entertaining fundamentals in this Core Knowledge series makes my job as a homeschool mom, much easier! They also have lesson plans and tests on their [website](http://coreknowledge.org/CK/about/index.htm).

With family travel, sometimes it is the little things that one remembers. [Extended family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is often just about doing ordinary things in extraordinary places. Like [playing in the sand ....in the Sahara](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html), [finger painting.... in France with fairies](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/valley-of-the-f.html) or [swimming ...with Roman ruins in Turkey.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/pamukkale-and-h.html)

We loved how this photograph turned out looking like art. One of my [greatest joys on our world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) was picking up our child every day from school when [we wintered in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html). Just an ordinary family activity in an [extraordinary place](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html). The sun was almost always shining and we would make our way home, often stopping to [talk to the horses](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/12/grace-gratitude.html), watch sheep or [oxen go by](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-photo-spain-around-the-world-travel-ox-traditional-white-village-expat-lifestyle.html), climbing trees and [picking avocados or citrus](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/free-travel-food-helps-a-cheap-budget-family-travel-international-travel-tips.html), and spending time at this fountain with the  Koi fish. Simple pleasures and happy memories. I so appreciate the gift of time that our global tour gives us.

"Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things." Brault

What little thing gave you pleasure today? Here in Barcelona this afternoon, listening to the Mozart and her friends from many countries play and giggle as I sat  in my lounge chair just feeling the breeze, listening to the birds chirp, looking at the distant deep blue Med sea next to the clear blue sky between swaying green pine trees made me happy. The simplicity of it all reminded me of this photograph.

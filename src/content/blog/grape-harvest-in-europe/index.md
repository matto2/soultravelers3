We've been blessed to experience many wine tours, [vineyards](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/oporto-dorhou-v.html "europe vineyards") and wine tasting all over Europe, from some of thier most [famous wine regions](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/01/family-travel-photofrance-alsace-wine-region.html "famous wine region europe") to more [obscure places](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/sirince-charms.html "obscure wine region"). This photo was taken near the Penedes wine region in Spain where we stopped at a lovely restaurant on our way back from Andorra this past September.  
  
Today is "Wine Wednesday" on Twitter, so I thought this would be a a charming addition. Here are some more posts that we have written about [European vineyards](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/hello-cote-dor.html "European vineyards") and wine.

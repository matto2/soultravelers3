Happy Easter from tropical Asia!  
Since we are sticking to our  
healthy, organic eating

Happy [Easter from tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/04/celebrating-easter-in-asia.html "easter in asia")! Since we are sticking to our [healthy organic eating on the road](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy organic eating while traveling"), we managed to find some fun ways to celebrate Easter with our child doing [superfood healthy treats](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "superfood healthy treats").

That is a free-range pastured egg deviled with home made organic mayonnaise plus added organic Asian greens, olives and organic carrot. I made the chocolate treat out of organic raw cocoa, cold pressed organic coconut oil, raw honey, goji berry for the heart, bananas and organic walnuts. Mozart adored waking up to both surprises! Fast, easy, creative, delicious and super healthy...right up my alley.  
  
![tumeric dyed easter eggs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833016764c9c93e970b.jpg)  
  
  
At the last minute I looked up ways to dye eggs naturally from things you have in the pantry. The only thing we had that would work was tumeric, so we dyed all of our eggs golden! After breakfast, Mozart enjoyed a little Easter Egg hunt around the house.  
  
Later we will make more of those little chicks for an evening snack...craft project and healthy snack all in one.  
  
![Gorgeous double rainbow](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330168e9cac1e9970c.jpg)  
  
  
We've been blessed with some amazing rainbows this week. The days are almost always sunny here, but often around dinner time there is a quick shower as things cool down. This was a double rainbow yesterday and more glorious than my camera can catch!  
  
![peaceful cruising Adaman Sea](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833016303d52575970d.jpg)

Often at dinner time there is a white cruise ship that ambles by and sometimes as the sun sets it's lights go on. There is a great peace looking out over the Andaman Sea, can you feel it?  
  
  
When I watch the sail boats, I day dream about our goal of learning to sail while here.

I must admit I do miss our [Easters in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html "easter in spain") as their "[Semana Santa](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/semana-santa-in.html "semana santa")" is perhaps the best place in the world to [celebrate Easter](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/semana-santa-in.html "celebrate Easter"), but we're enjoying the laid back family time. It's our 2nd Easter here and since it is an Islamic country it's not a big celebration  ( although there are quite a few Christians as well..we saw lots out with palms last Sunday).  
  
![view from my kitchen](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330168e9ca9528970c.jpg)  
  
   
I love the simple pleasures here like how the wind whips up and blows my curtains around while I watch the view and cut up things for dinner.  
  
![colorful papaya](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330168e9ca9680970c.jpg)  
  
  
  
I often cut up a papaya for breakfast when I make my smoothie ( those are organic prune pits too...as I use them as well). I thought jeesh, even the colors of my garbage is photogenic. Tropical life agrees with me in many ways.  
  
![Yum! Salmon cooking](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833016764c9c05e970b.jpg)  
  
  
We had really scrumptious salmon for our Easter Dinner, something we have quite often here as it is cheap, healthy and  delicious. I just cook it with a little coconut oil and braggs aminos and it is done in minutes.  
  
![raw organic salad](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330168e9ca9b0b970c.jpg)  
  
  
Ymmy salad with all organic ingredients and home made dressing! We had organic brown basmati rice too which I soaked overnight first which is the [nourishing traditions way](http://www.westonaprice.org/food-features/living-with-phytic-acid "nourishing traditions") for healthier eating and a big hit with my family as it is as nutritious as brown rice is, but soaking it makes it taste like perfect white rice.

Oh my, how was this full moon in your part of the world? It was breathtakingly gorgeous here these last few nights, but alas my camera can't really capture it.

So much beauty everywhere..the rainbows, the moon, the food..so I am feeling very grateful and blessed. Hoping this love fills your life too!

We love how our [travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel lifestyle") and [minimalist living ways](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist living ways"), increase our [creativity and fun](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/02/creative-projec.html "creativity and fun"). Mozart and DaVinci are making an awesome playhouse for her playmobiles out of the box that our new desks came in. Reminds me of the huge one they did in Spain when she was 6 or the large car they made last year. More details about that later, but it's been part of our Easter week delights as we work together and Mozart happily hums along as she creates.

We are a day ahead, so will call family tomorrow, our Monday and their Easter Sunday. Luckily, our church does a wonderful Easter Service at the beach and has it "live  streaming" on the internet, so we will be able to join in with them ( as it works for our time zone).  
  
Easter is the demonstration of God that life is essentially spiritual and timeless.  ~Charles M. Crowe  
  
Happy, Happy Easter! What has brought you pleasure during this Easter week, Passover, spring?

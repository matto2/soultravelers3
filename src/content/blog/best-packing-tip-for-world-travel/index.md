When it comes to [world travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "around the world travel"), the key is always to pack light because that grants you much more freedom and as a reformed over-packer I can tell you that one needs MUCH less than you think. I've written about packing in our [Top 10 Family Travel Tips](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html "top 10 family travel tips") , [How to be a World Traveling Fashionista](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "how to be a world traveling fashionista") and [10 Best Tips for Family Friendly Travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html "10 best tips for family friendly travel"), but will be writing more on this topic.  
  
One year weÂ  [traveled around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family travel around the world") ( 26 airports, 13 countries) over 12 months with just a small carry-on piece of luggage each and stayed on our $23/day per person budget as we've done continuously over these last almost 7 years of [non-stop world travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "non-stop world travel") to 44 countries on 5 continents.  
  
We started our [world travel with more luggage](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/the-long-flight.html "world travel and luggage"), but the longer we travel the less we find we need.  
  
Yes, it's true, families can live luxuriously, cheaply without over packing!  
  
**THINK LIGHT AND MULTI-PURPOSE**  
  
One of the keys of light packing and cheap, but luxurious [mininalist living](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "Minimalist living"), is to think multipurpose when ever possible, and this beautiful sarong/pareo/kanga that I bought in [Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora") is a great example. It's high-quality, beautiful, takes up little space but can be used as skirt, bathing suit cover, sheet, pillow, picnic blanket, table cloth, shawl, dress, towel, head cover, kids toy tent, beach towel, nightgown, and more. Goes nicely too with my basic black wardrobe. I could have bought one for cheaper in another country, but it's a [fabulous souvenir](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/souvenirs-what-do-you-buy-.html "fabulous souvenir") too that gives me great pleasure every time I look at it.  
  
We started our [family world tou](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family world tour")r with microfiber towels instead, which work in the exact same way, but I left mine in [Moorea with our couch surfing friends](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/moorea-cheap-and-amazing.html "Moorea couch surfing"), thus I switched to this beautiful sarong which works perfect in Asia as well as [in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "in europe family travel"). It's particularly nice if one travels to warm weather areas like we tend to.

**TIPS AND BENEFITS OF EDUCATIONAL TRAVEL FOR KIDS**  
  
  
![Make history come alive by visiting sacred sites like this one in Bhutan and wearing native dress](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901deaf403970b.jpg)  
  
  
 You don't have to be a [long term travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "long term travel world school education homeschooling"),  [digital nomad family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomad family") to take advantage of these tips, ANY one can take ANY [vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/florida-family-vacation-fun.html "florida family vacation") and turn it into a [learning vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/learning-vacations-educational-trips-that-teach-kids.html "learning vacations - how to do it") and [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschool and travel") enrichment program.  
  
Take advantage of exposing your child to ANY new environment and learn together by being curious!  
  
"Once a year, go some place you have never been before" - Dalai Lama  
  
  
![Education and travel work together even more when you learn the language](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901deaf6bc970b.jpg)  
  
**LEARNING THE LANGUAGE IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW A CULTURE**  
  
Since her parents are monolinguals, our child wouldn't be as [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent in mandarin") or as [fluent in Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/bilingual-baby-learning-spanish-as-2nd-language.html "fluent in spanish - how to  raise a bilingual kid") without travel, nor would she be such a good [reader in 3 languages.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "multilingual learning")  
  
[Learning languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/language-learning/ "learning languages kids") at home from birth, will give your kids a head start in life and add to any travel.  
  
**![Education can be gained by spending time in another country and culture like our little flamenco dancer in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019104760d28970c.png)**  
"Travel, in the younger sort, is part of education; in the elder, a part of experience." Bacon **BOOKS, BOOKS, BOOKS**  
  
Our child was already [fluent in Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html#more "growing up bilingual") before we [traveled to Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html#more "travel to spain kids tips"), so monolinguals can [raise multilingual kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "raise multilingual kids") at home....  
  
 BUT [learning Spanish in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning spanish in spain") made a huge difference in her second [language immersion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "language immersion and global citizens") with [reading](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/10-tips-to-raise-a-reader-book-lover.html "tips to raise a reader") and [writing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/spanish-crayons.html "writing in spain"), as well as [connecting deeply with locals](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "connecting with locals in spain") and the [culture](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "traveling kids and friends").

[Travel and books](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "travel and books") go hand and hand and one of the major keys to our [homeschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/home-school-kids-travel.html "homeschooling and travel") plan, is reading about places before, during and after a trip which enriches the experience.

 ”One free lunch in the world is to learn another language in early childhood.”-  Pinker, MIT Linguist  
  
![Make touring ancient sites like Ephesue fun even for young chlldren by using costumes, books and imagination](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019103e1141e970c.png)  
  
**TOP TIP FOR EDUCATIONAL TRAVEL WITH KIDS**  
  
Kids love fun and travel icons, so one of the [best educational tips for young travelers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html "best educational tips for kids travel tours and museums") is dressing them up in local costumes. This helps them connect deeper to the culture and the history and it is a fantastic souvenir too that takes up little room in your suitcase.  
  
![Make education fun for kids like joining these terracotta warriors in Xi'an, China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192abaa2de0970d.jpg)  
  
**BUDGET TRAVEL TIPS**  
  
You don't always have to buy them, sometimes you can just borrow them from locals or they are part of the tourism photo opportunities like these photos from the [Terracotta Army](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/terracotta-army.html "terracotta army") in [Xi'an](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-travel-shopping-and-markets-rtw.html "xi'an travel, china"), [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "trip to china") or [Alhambra in Spain.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/-alhambra-moorish-palace-in-granada-with-gypsy-guitar.html "alhambra in spain - beautiful photo and tips") We travel on just $23/day per person, so sticking to a [tiny budget](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/camping-in-london-best-low-budget-travel.html "travel london on a budget") is important to us.  
  
![dressing up as a moorish princess adds to the living history of the Alahambra for this child](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019103e1267a970c.png)  
  
**MAKE HISTORY COME ALIVE**  
  
Yes, it may be a bit corny, but kids love it and it always ends up to be a giggle for the whole family and a [photo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/the-ultimate-travel-photo.html "ultimate travel photo") treasure that you will enjoy forever that brings the happy memories back.  
  
Our 12 year old daughter still remembers [playing a Moorish princess](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/ancient-princes.html "travel kids tips alhambra princess costumes") at the [Alhambra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/granadas-alhambra.html "alhambra travel spain") ( [multigenerational travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "multigenerational travel")) in this photo above taken when she was barely 6, like it was yesterday.  
  
![Educational tip? Eat like a local in dress and chopsticks like here in Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019103e13673970c.jpg)  
  
**DIP INTO LOCAL CULTURE WITH FOOD**  
  
A special meal like this [Peking Duck](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/peking-duck-in-beijing.html "Peking duck beijing") [in Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/best-things-to-do-in-beijing-china-.html "best things to do in beijing"), can be made even more special by adding tradtional clothes and using chop sticks like locals.  
  
![Teach kids even concepts like what it is like to be a pilgrim on the camino in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019103e16363970c.jpg)  
  
**TEACH HISTORY THE FUN WAY**  
  
A costume and photo op can help a child make deeper meaning out of being [a little pilgrim](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/little-pilgrims.html "kids - little pilgrim spain's  pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela") on the [famous Camino](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/pint-sized-pilg.html "child doing camino Santiago de Compostela") in [Santiago de Compostel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/santiago-de-com.html "santiago de Compostela")a, along with reading about it.

**MAKE THE MOST OUT OF HERITAGE TRAVEL**  
  
Sometimes when doing [heritage travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/family-travel-ireland.html "exploring roots and cultural heritage  via travel"), it is hard to resist the clothes of one's ancestors. It certainly made [Edinburgh's Festival](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/family-travel-scotland-edinburgh-festival-photo.html "edinburgh festival scotland travel") in [Scotland](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-scotland-edinburgh-funny-sign-souvenir-shop-edinburgh-festival-camping.html "scotland travel"), more exciting for us with our daughter dressed in a tam and kilt from a family traditional pattern and fisherman sweater.  
  
Fablulous first hand lessons with a street performer added unexpecgted  magic to our tour.

Sometimes it's small things like this adorable Venetian mask that she wore on the [gondola ride](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/venetian-violin.html "venice gondola ride ") where she played the violin as we [explored Venice](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/venezia.html "exploring Venice, italy").  
  
 Doing [kids book based itineraries](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/kids-lit-itiner.html "kids book itinerary in Venice, Italy") makes it more enriching for families with young children.

What could be better for a 7 year old [Harry Potter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSB7Gictlag "harry potter best video") fan than [flying with Harry at Hogwarts?](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/harry-potter-books-and-family-travel-tips.html "Harry potter travel with kids") We thought it well worth the money to buy her favorite Gryfindor hero Hermoine's robe and broom here and used it for a [Halloween](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html "best halloween") costume for several years.

**FAMILY TRAVEL ADVENTURE TIPS**  
  
Usually our daughter Mozart does the dressing up, but sometimes we all do it. Again, not a traditional costume, but fun to experience this ice bar in [Stockholm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-sweden-stockholm-harbor-boats.html "stockholm travel") in the summer time.

**FAMILY ADVENTURE IDEAS**  
  
Sometimes, like recently in [Beijing at the Forbidden City](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "beijing best and forbidden city"), we do it with the whole family.

It made our second trip to the this famous palace extra exciting, brought insight into the [Emperors lavishness and sophistication,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/soultravelers3-in-china-emperors-style.html "china travel emperors") enhanced our [colorful Beijing Opera](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-travel-peking-opera.html "peking opera") understanding and we still laugh every time we watch this video.

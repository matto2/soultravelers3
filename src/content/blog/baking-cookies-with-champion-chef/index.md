We stayed three nights at the [Four Seasons Amman](http://www.fourseasons.com/amman/ "Four Seasons Amman") in [Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "jordan travel") and they really spoiled us! Have you ever taken a cooking vacation? How about as a kid? As promised in my short [cooking and travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/cooking-at-four-seasons-amman.html#more "cooking and travel")  post, I'll share our [adorable cooking travel video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsCbJSnAhRs "adorable cooking travel video") and more baking cookies photos below.

After we parents got an amazing massage, it was Mozart's turn to learn the secrets of award winning Pastry Chef Anas Qsairi and experience the grand pastry kitchen at the Four Seasons Hotel. How many kids get this one-of-a-kind culinary journey? Wow!  
  
We'll be writing more about our incredible family stay there, but this post is about the food making with a kid. I had never considered a culinary vacation as a family, but this experience opened my eyes to the fascinating, interactive possibilities and why they are becoming more popular.

First, the most important secret to cooking is the recipe, right?

This is a busy, popular pastry kitchen and they do lots of weddings, bnaquets and special events

What is your favorite cookie making story? I don't think we will ever bake again without remembering this special treat.

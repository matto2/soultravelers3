Can a new teenager have a blast in a healthy way celebrating her 13th birthday? Yes, indeed and that is exactly what we did at [Four Seasons Hotel Sydney](http://www.fourseasons.com/sydney/ "four seasons hotel sydney")!  
  
Her birthday was in the fall, but thanks to our [fast travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/road-trip-usa-best-of-the-west.html "road trip across the west coast USA") on 3 continents these last few months, we are just getting this up now.  
  
**BIRTHDAYS AND TRAVEL**  
  
Since we have been [traveling the world non-stop](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "world traveling family") for the last 8 years, celebrating birthdays are a little different for our [trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "trilingual kid impressive speech") daughter.

**CELEBRATING BIRTHDAYS ABROAD**  
  
It started when we began when she was 5 as it helped her identify exactly what "world travel" was by planning her 6th [birthday in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "birthday in paris") before we left. Who knew we were starting a trend?  
  
She celebrated her 7th [birthday in Salzburg](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/super-7-salzbur.html "birthday in salzburg"),Â  her [8th birthday in Stockholm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html "8th birthday in stockholm"), her 9th [birthday in London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html "birthday in london"), her 10th [birthday in Barcelona,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "birthday in barcelona") with her Spanish speaking best friend, her 11th birthday at [Harry Potter's Wizarding World,](http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/ "harry potter's wizarding world") and her [12th in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/global-travel-tween-ultimate-birthday-party-in-asia.html "teen birthday in Asia"), Malaysia with her [Mandarin speaking](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "WHY LEARN MANDARIN IN ASIA") friends.

**CELEBRATING IN SYDNEY**  
  
So her 13th birthday in Sydney made it the 9th country and 4th continent that she has celebrated a birthday on our open ended world tour!  
  
We couldn't have picked a better place for this rite of passage as she becomes a teenager. We were completely beguiled from the moment we saw the breathtaking views from our room of the [stunning Sydney harbor](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/11/stunning-sydney-view.html "STUNNING SYDNEY HARBOR VIEW").  
  
[![Sydney view from our Four Seasons suite](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d857d15970d.png "Sydney view from our Four Seasons suite")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d857d15970d.png)  
  
**GLUTEN-FREE, GRAIN-FREE**  
  
The Concierge, Chefs as well as the Director of Public Relations Hansni Bhagani went out of their way to make this first teen birthday super memorable. Despite our challenges of special dietary issues for health reasons, [FS Sydney](http://familyholidays.fourseasons.com/family-vacation-sydney-australia/ "FS SYDNEY") served us the most delicious paleo food and even a [scrumptious chocolate cake](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/10/best-chocolate-cake-recipe-ever-and-its-paleo-healthy-grain-free.html "BEST CHOCOLATE PAELO CAKE") that was gluten and grain free!  
  
[![delicous food at Four Seasons Sydney - Paleo style!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcca539a970b.png "delicous food at Four Seasons Sydney - Paleo style!")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcca539a970b.png)  
  
**WORLD'S HEALTHIEST INSTRUMENT** **IS ABORIGINAL**  
  
Our stay started with a bang...or rather a drone from Australia's national musical instrument made by the Aboriginal people called a [didgeridoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo "DIDGERIDOO") which has been a healing tool for at least 40,000 years and many call the healthiest musical instrument in the world.  
  
Our [teen Mozart is a musician](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/mozart-plays-mozart-and-more-violin-and-piano-performance.html "teen Mozart playing Mozart"), [singer and prolific songwriter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/tween-is-a-talented-singer-songwriter.html "Mozart singer and songwriter teen"), so they arranged some didgeridoo lessons in our gorgeous suite from "[Gifts at the Quay"](http://www.giftsatthequay.com/ "gifts of the quay buy didgeridoo sydney") and she was delighted.

**WHAT IS A DIDGERIDOO?**  
  
Until our first trip to Australia a few years ago, I had never heard of a didgeridoo, but recently it was recommended to us by [Carol Vander Stoep](http://www.mouthmattersbook.com/ "mouth matters") because there is no other instrument as potent for health ( based on scientific studies) and it is almost identical to the Buteyko breathing technique similar to the meditation breathing achieved by yoga masters.

**BUYING A DIDGERIDOO**  
  
We enjoyed the lesson and didgeridoo jam sesson so much, that we decided to get our own to add to our [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "TRAVEL LIFESTYLE") ( along with our piano, violin and guitar that our [kiddo plays around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "KID PLAYING VIOLIN AROUND THE WORLD")) and will be writing more about that.

**MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN SYDNEY**  
  
Mozart also has a [passion for art](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/mobile-mozart-a.html "KID MOZART HAS PASSION FOR ART AND CREATIVITY") so loved visiting the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art, feeding seagulls near the Circular Quay, and wandering around this enchanting historic Sydney city center area called "The Rocks".

**EXPLORING SYDNEY**  
  
We took a ferry ride to Manly Beach to [visit local friend](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/mozart-meeting-soultravelers3-blog-readers-around-the-world.html "MEETING SOULTRAVELERS READERS")s and caught a spectacular sunset of Sydney from the natural bushlands of North Head Sanctuary area.Â

**LUXURY LOVING TEEN**  
  
This new teen joyously tried out the sauna ,steam room, Jacuzzi and felt like a glamorous model as she enjoyed lolling about the roof pool area reading Vogue and snacking. Still mostly kid, we watched her gleefully jump and do cannon balls into the pool.

**FIREWORKS IN SYDNEY**  
  
We knew our travel baby's teen years were off to an auspicious start when the night of her birthday we watched fireworks going off in Sydney while laying in our beds ( much to our surprise)!  
  
[![Sydney Harbor fireworks seen  from our Four Seasons suite](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d857ffc970d.png "Sydney Harbor fireworks seen  from our Four Seasons suite")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d857ffc970d.png)

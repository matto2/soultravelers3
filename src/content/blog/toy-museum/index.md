Meeting the sweet owner and collector, João d' Arbués Moreira in this very special toy museum, called Museu do Brinquedo,  was a real treat! There were over 43,000 toys there and he has been [collecting them](http://www.museu-do-brinquedo.pt/layout.asp?area=1000&lang=en) since he was a young boy of seven, our Mozart's age. I had read that it is the best museum in Sintra and it certainly was impressive. We [had been](http://www.visit-salzburg.net/sights/toymuseum.htm) to a [good one in Salzburg](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/sassy-salzburg.html) on Mozart's birthday last fall, but this one was much better. It was really mind blowing for a toy museum, even for people like us that know little about toys.

We were all engrossed in different sections and I was taking some pictures of some fascinating small toys, when a man in a wheel chair started talking to me in English. He was explaining that the tiny toys were part of a Portuguese Christmas tradition and are put inside a cake. I knew about [this tradition](http://www.idealspain.com/pages/information/ChristmasInSpain.htm) because they do the same thing on Three Kings/ Los Reyes Day in Spain. So we got into a conversation and I soon found out that he knew so much because he was the proud owner who had spent his life collecting all these toys and creating this museum.

That added an exciting element, so I quickly introduced Mozart and DaVinci to him and we all talked for a while. It was so interesting, that DaVinci asked him if he could do a spontaneous interview with him for our website via our video camera. He consented, so without further ado let me introduce you to João d' Arbués Moreira :

We will be doing a whole flickr section with pictures of his cool toys,as we could not stop taking pictures of them,  but here are a few from our enjoyable romp through what might be the world's best toy museum!

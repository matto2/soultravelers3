This year our traveling  
family is home for the  
holidays for the first time

This year our [traveling family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling family") is [home for the holidays](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/home-for-the-holidays.html "home for the holidays") for the first time in six years, and sadly, I have been very sick most of the 3 months that we have been here. Today, on Christmas Day, my sister has been hospitalized with pnuemonia. Nevertheless, we are  cherishing all the little moments and full of gratitude for the Grace that is in our lives.

A year ago, my mother [lost her beloved husband](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "lost her beloved husband"), but this holiday season she got to spend the most time she ever has with her granddaughter and they both have been so enriched by this time together. At almost 84 ( in a few days) and just turned 11, these precious,fleeting  moments are priceless.  
  
Yes , [Grandma spent 6 weeks with us in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "traveling with grandma"), most of Mozart's first 5 years living nearby, regular skype webcam calls from where ever we are on the planet..but nothing can compare to this one-on-one time and 3 months of sleeping together nightly like two school girls on an extended pajama party at our home base in California. Unlike our country home, my Mom's house is within walking distance to the beach, parks, stores and library which makes it very convenient.

Yes, we [celebrate Christmas in special ways abroad](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "celebrate christmas in special ways abroad"), but for a kid, there is nothing quite like doing it at home and with Grandma. Here she makes a gingerbread house and she put up a tree at Grandma's house..something that has not been in this house for years.

Yum! And then there is the food. My Mom is famous for her holiday meals and even I (with my severe digestion problems) have managed to at least get a bite of them and savored every crumb and the happy memories that come with that.

No one does Christmas lights like they do in America, so that's been a treat for Mozart while she is still young enough to be totally dazzled by  it. This Christmas Tree Lane was in Fresno area where DaVinci's family lives. Just as DaVinci has had his work cut out for him due to my debilitating condition, non-stop doctor visits and special needs, his sister is challenged by a beloved husband dealing with Alziemers. DaVinci's beloved father also passed away last year, so these tender times prompted us to return for the holidays and spend a bit longer here.  
  
![cooking with auntie](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301675f5ed74c970b.jpg)  
  
  
But even as we deal with our many challenges, we find time and ways to share the sweet, little joys of the season. Sometimes that is just cooking together and being together. Here Mozart makes her organic kale smoothie she learned through her Dirt to Dinner science lab job in San Jose with her aunt in Fresno.  
  
![kids duet on violin and cello](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330162fe6ac54a970d.jpg)  
  
Friends and music are blessings of this season. We haven't been able to spend as much time with friends as we would have liked to, but loved this Christmas Eve duet between Mozart and a friend she has known since they were both in the womb.  
  
![beautiful girls](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301675f5f2953970b.jpg)  
  
We got to share in our Christmas Eve church service online together and share a lovely dinner. I had an amazing experience doing the Living in Grace training online which connected me to friends in a way I could handle ( from my bed). Skype webcams allowed me to have intimate conversations with friends in Bulgaria, UK, Colorado and LA.  
  
![hanukkah](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833015438e94a90970c.jpg)  
  
  
We are not Jewish, but enjoyed the Hebrew songs and lighting the candles of Hanukkah with dear friends that kidlet calls her "God cousins" because their Grandfather is her Godfather.  
  
![san francisco at christmas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301675f5f5d89970b.jpg)  
  
  
We even managed to get up to San Francisco on a beautiful weekend where we connected with friends and Mozart sang confidently for a large crowd. ( Video coming soon).  
  
![gingerbread house](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330162fe6a95f7970d.jpg)  
  
  
It's been a wild ride this holiday sesaon for us, where I have frequently been in pain that is at a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 ( and often at night), so I seem to live now on the edge of never knowing if I will need to rush to the emergency room or sometimes even if I will live. All of this without a clear diagnosis and interspersed with times where I feel like I am getting better. I hope I have found something on my own, that seems to be working, but time will tell. Mastic Gum has worked better than anything so far.  
  
![Christmas lights](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833015438e9d6fe970c.jpg)  
  
  
Yet, all I can think of today really is how blessed I am and what a blessed life we live. Since I have been home, I have found out that 3 dear friends have cancer and celebrate several who have beat cancer. I know many who face many challenges at this time from debt to disease. My heart goes out to all and still I remain an optimist.  
  
In this season of light, I know we are all blessed and more blessings are pouring down upon us. Somehow we will meet the challenges and I think it begins by being grateful for all the little blessings. May blessings of love, healing, joy, freedom and abundance surround you this holiday season and always!

The Family Sabbatical Handbook  
This book like Escape 101, is about a family that spent an extended vacation in Mexico with a small childÂ  and gained a lot of first hand information about how to do that. I think it is valuable to read many books on this topic to gain something unique from each as one plans their own escape. Lots of good information here that can help you with planning.

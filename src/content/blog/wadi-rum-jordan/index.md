Of all the [magnificent sights](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "magnificent Petra ") that we saw on our [journey to Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "trip to jordan tips"), Wadi Rum was my husband's favorite. Here you can get a sense of our joy as we took a tea break in the middle of no where, at a small Bedouin camp during our tour by jeep over desert sands.   
  
Majestic magical  mountains, vast desert landscapes, orange, red, rust colors, legacy of Lawrence, 5 bridges, archaeology mysteries ...too hard to describe because it is much like taking a trip to another world and Wadi Rum is one of the most beautiful deserts on our planet.  
  
Sweet and bright, Saleh Ahmad Arfou,  our guide, is a [Bedouin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/bedouins-in-jordan.html "Bedouin nomads") who grew up nomading in the desert until mid-childhood and has a degree in archaeology. He added so much to our visit  as did the [Jordan Toursim Board](http://www.visitjordan.com/ "Jordan tourism board") which [sponsored our Jordan trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "sponsored jordan trip tourism").  
  
This is another [photo of our Wadi Rum](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/fathers-day-weekend-trips-or-family-international-travel-.html "photo of wadi rum") jeep tour and I hope you didn't miss this [photo of Wadi Rum](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/wadi-rum-bedouin-honeymoon-suite-.html "Wadi Rum photo"), or the newborn  [baby camel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/jordan-family-travel-means-beautiful-baby-camel.html "baby camel") we met there. We have so much more that I need to share and will, but I think the wonderous classic movie, Laurance of Arabia gives the best sense of the take-your-breath-away grandeur that is Wadi Rum.

is the fresh baked bread,

One of the fantastic things [about Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/road-trip-europe-plan-then-improvise.html "about Europe") is the fresh baked bread, baguettes, "pan" and croissants. Every morning when I take my walk near the sea, I smell the bread and pastries being baked. We didn't know before our [family world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world tour") that almost all of the [campsites in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "campsites in europe") have freshly baked bread and croissants at very cheap prices.  
  
This is a photo of the Catalan bakery at our [resort in Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "barcelona resort") where we were most of the summer and where we often [stay for months](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "months at a time") at a time over the last 6 [years of travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "years of travel").  The warm bread is delicious ( kidlet loves to soak it in Balsamic and virgin olive oil) and they have the very best croissants in Europe in my humble opinion.  
  
They also have some amazing pastries and cupcakes although we try not to indulge in those too often. Kidlet enjoys riding her bike in the morning to the store and bakery ( short distance) and bringing home the bread for breakfast or later for dinner.  
  
It's a good life! Grin. What are your favorite baked goods from Europe? We've had too many to tell, but the [Belem pastries in Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/portuguese-day.html "Belem pastries in Portugal"), [cream puffs in Netherlands](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/divine-cheese-a.html "creme puffs in netherlands") and [pancakes in Finland](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/family-travel-photo-finland-aland-islands-pancakes.html "pancakes in finland") or  home cooked delights from our dear [friends in Sweden](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/funniest-kids-soultravelers3-family-travel-best-funny-youtube-global-kids-hilarious-sweden-trumpet-v.html "friends in sweden") come to mind off hand beside this bread and croissants.

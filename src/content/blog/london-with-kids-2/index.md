Since we started our [family travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "family travel lifestyle"), we have been to London a bunch of times and will probably go many more times. I've been there over twenty times and always disover new things. There is always [more to see in London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html#more "more to see in London") and it's one of our favorite cities.  
  
Plus we have many dear friends that live in London, so it makes it one of our [homes around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "Making friends around the world"). On our last visit to London, we were [interviewed by the BBC on social media](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "interveiw soultravelers3 on BBC about social media and travel "), so that was quite a thrill.

We find May and September the best times to visit for the best shot for sunny weather. There is absolutely nothing as thrilling as sunny days in London and Great Britain, but be aware that those days are rare, so dress appropriately as rain, clouds and drizzle is usually in the forecast.

You can't miss the theatre when in London. We've seen so many awesome shows there including the 25th  
anniversary of Les Miz while we were [homeschooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling and travel ") about the French Revolution and a s [stupendous performance of King Lear](http://www.londondingdong.blogspot.com/2008/04/review-of-king-lear-at-globe-theatre.html) ..a perfect [unschool travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "unschool travel") opportunity..for free!

Even getting around London can be a fun and educational experience. Mozart loved this Paddington Bear stand at the Paddington Station.

Those big red buses are a must do for kids...especially one with an open top.

Even taxi's are fun in London or something a little wild like this.

and trains in London. One of the best parts of family travel is just doing ordinary things in extraordinary places. It changes one's perspective forever.

Don't forget to do the touristy things like London Eye, High Tea, Covent Garden, Changing of the Guard, etc, but know that part of the joy is just walking about in this beautiful city and don't over do.

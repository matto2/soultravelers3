If you do family travel then  
you can't go to London and  
miss the iconic London Bridge

<!--more--> ![London bridge a must for London family vacation](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e896056a5970d.jpg)

If you do [family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel ") then you can't go to [London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "london") and miss the iconic [Tower Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge "london bridge") which every kid is curious about because of that famous childhood song  "London Bridges falling down".  
  
Since we started our [family travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "family travel lifestyle"), we have been to London three times and will probably go many more times. I've been there over twenty times and always disover new things. There is always [more to see in London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html#more "more to see in London") and it's one of our favorite cities, plus we have dear friends that live there. Last visit to London, we were [interviewed by the BBC on social media](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "interveiw soultravelers3 on BBC about social media and travel "), so that was quite a thrill.  
  
One of the fantastic things for [family friendly travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html "family friendly travel") when visiting London with kids is the [FREE museums](http://www.google.com/cse?cx=001050992314836563403%3Ae46e6t4uayg&cof=FORID%3A&q=london&sa=Go&siteurl=www.soultravelers3.com%2F "london free museums"). We also loved seeing a world class play at the [Globe Theater for free](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html "globe theatre free London"). Last time we stayed at this [best budget hotel in London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/top-budget-hotel-london-travelodge-waterloo-review-central-london-lodging-bargain-family-friendly.html "best budget hotel in london") and we've done a short term  [rental apartment](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/10/-roomorama-short-term-rentals-usa-london-budget-hotel-apartments-.html "short term rental apartment london") there as well as [camping London](http://www.visitlondon.com/category/accommodation/caravan-and-camping "camping London") for long stays.

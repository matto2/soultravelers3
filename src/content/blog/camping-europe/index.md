Camping keeps our budget to a minimum in Europe while living luxuriously and bonding with locals.  
  

Thanks for the shout out! Yes, it is a little different camping in Europe, more luxury for budget travelers, less wilderness campsites ( although there are some of those too). We see mostly backpackers in little tents & some have got it to an art form. One should definitely read up on camping in Europe before coming even if you are a seasoned camper as each country is a little different. Many countries have free camping..often WITH tables. ðŸ˜‰ Itâ€™s a great way to see Europe & easy to learn as you go.

One good thing about the campsites for tent folks is many have lounges with TVâ€™s and eating/cooking areas with refrigerators/freezers for tenters and almost all have rental cottages, some better than many apartments. Most also allow bar-b-ques as we do that a lot. Weâ€™ve seen many Europeans that donâ€™t even use tents in the warm weather, just sleep on the ground, even families dashing about Europe in little cars.

Have you seen the Dutch with their HUGE tents ( bigger than RVâ€™s) & set up? They drive all over and camp in style with the whole family. Itâ€™s good to know European school vacation times as well as suddenly you will see a whole slew of one nationality when they have school holidays. ðŸ˜‰

We havenâ€™t run into too much noise yet, except on weekends in the high seasonâ€¦usually it is the disco music if one is too near to itâ€¦, so have not ever used ear plugs yet. Usually campsites are really quiet during the day and most have silent rules after 10pm or midnight. Iâ€™m surprised that you have run into so much noise so early in the season.

Alan Rogers is pretty good & we have used it some, but not my favorite book as I think it is more geared to UK/European campers. I prefer the ones written by Americans & think Churchâ€™s book is the best by far. (I have a list of them on my site that I have reviewed. ) It gives you a LOT of info about each campsite, so that really helps in deciding. Most of the American books explain about bringing tables & chairs because that is different than north America. We had cheapo ones when we began that came with our RV, but now we have REALLY nice Italian ones that we bought in Verona a few years back..ahhhh, what luxury! I could sleep in my comfy lounger! ðŸ˜‰

Like most things, there is a learning curve to camping in Europe and one learns most by doing. We love some of the big luxe resorts, but also have fave little tiny places. There are pros & cons to every each choice from tenting, cottage, RV, caravan or train, car, cargo ship or using rentals/pensions & we have tried them all. Following the weather makes it MUCH easier because camping or touring in cold and rain is not much fun or in crowds & excruciating heat.

Itâ€™s been great watching you guys explore & enjoy the adventure! I hope you inspire more to try the camping Europe route! France and Spain are two great countries to do it in.

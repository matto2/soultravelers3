Linnea in Monet's Garden  
Simply a wonderful book to help a young child prepare for Paris, Monet, Giverny, museums, history and gardens and encourages her to appreciate the beauty of all. It will also keep the memories alive years after the event. We even got the doll of Linnea while at one of the Paris museums and Mozart carried it with her all over France and still plays with her from time to time. We wrote about how we used it to plan part of our Itinerary [here](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/giverny-monets.html#more) & I don't think Mozart will ever forget Angelinas.

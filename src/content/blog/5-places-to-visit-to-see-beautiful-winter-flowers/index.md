Recently a long time world traveling/worldschooling friend of mine who is living in Mexico but thinking about moving to Spain or southern France said that she must have a place where Bougainvillea grow and I thoroughly agree! This photo was taken in January in Barcelona, but our home in Santa Cruz also had a huge Bougainvillea plant on our arbor,  
  
![Bougainvillea ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b751710400200b-1024x768-1.jpg)  
  
  
and we love it here in Cyprus, and in all the places mentioned above. If and when we [buy a home in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/07/americans-house-hunting-in-spain-home-buying-abroad-.html), it will definitely have Bougainvillea!

Anther must is hibiscus thriving in winter! I don't know why but both of these flowers make me so happy every time I see them. 

![ 5 Places to Visit to See Beautiful Winter Flowers roses ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b75195510e200c-scaled-1.jpg)

Of course,  roses fit this category as well like this one I just took a photo of on my beach walk here in Cyprus.   
  
  
![Tropocal flowers in wimter like trumpet flower](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b75171040f200b.jpg)  
  
The Angels Trumpet ( Brugmansia) is another favorite with huge, fragrant flowers hanging from a small tree, it is a spectacular exotic plant common in the tropics, but also in Med areas like LA, Spain and Cyprus.   
  
![ 5 Places to Visit to See Beautiful Winter Flowers orange trees harvest ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b751955112200c.jpg)  
Orange, Lemon and Lime harvest in winter are not flowers, but they also make me happy always to see and sometimes pick to eat!  
  
![ 5 Places to Visit to See Beautiful Winter Flowers wild flowers and sunsets](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b6852844f7200d-768x768-1.jpg)

Sunsets and wild flowers are an unbeatable combo like these I picked in Croatia in late fall.   
  
![Fresh picked wild flowers ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b7519552ab200c-768x696-1.jpg)  
I  love picking wild flowers that I discover on my walks and I can make vases out of anything like these purple wild flowers from Cyprus in our airbnb home today and I made the vase from a used spice container. 

![ 5 Places to Visit to See Beautiful Winter Flowers yellow wild flowers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b75195514f200c-scaled.jpg)  
  
The flowers do not have to be fancy to make me happy, almost any will do like these sweet yellow ones that were scattered all over the park in Larnaca at the salt lake where the flamencos winter.   
  
What are your favorite flowers and where do you like to see them?

OMG! The tapa pub crawl in San Sebastian is like no where else and can not help but make your [tummy so happy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Q7dqqNYC8) and [satisfied](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/destinations/spain/article566949.ece) that you really begin to "get" this city and it's charms. This is family travel at it's most fun! We've had lots of tremendous [tapa crawls](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/tapas.html) in Spain and a fun singing pub crawl in Dingle, Ireland, but this city outshines them all. No "[foodie"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodie) should miss this and even if you are not a "foodie" you should not miss it.

Food is [what this city](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2005/mar/13/foodanddrink.shopping2) is about. There are as many [highest rated  restaurants](http://epicureanways.com/comments/spain-scores-high-on-worlds-50-best-restaurants-list/) in San Sebastian as either Madrid or Barcelona - cities that are almost 20 times larger! The [tapa crawl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_cuisine) starts in the old town going towards the port along cobbled streets with each tapa bar having a personality of it's own. Canapes and pinchos or pintxos (tapas on toothpicks) are what are popular here and some of them are very elaborate. We also tried the local Basque hard cider [Sidra](http://www.waitrose.com/drink/ciderandperry/ciderandperryarticles/0202058.aspx) and wine [Txakoli](http://www.cellartours.com/spain/spanish-wineries/talai-berri-winery.html). We can't really say which was our favorite tapa, we loved them all! Delicious!

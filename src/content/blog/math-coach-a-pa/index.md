Math Coach A Parent's Guide to  
Helping Children Succeed in Math  
This is a great book to help your kid with math whether you homeschool or have a child in school. When we are on the move, math, reading, music, games, journals & discussions are the keys for us. This is a good reference book & we carry it with us in our traveling library.

OMG! These dumplings were so delicious! What a wonderful and happy coincidence for us that during our [trip to Karkow,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/family-travel-krakow-poland-photo.html "trip to Krakow") that we happened to run into their famous dumpling festival that was only a block away from our [lovely hotel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-cool-krakow-bb-poland-best-budget-hotel.html "best hotel Krakow, poland"). Indeed, [Krakow is enchanting](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/krakow-holiday-vacation.html "Krakow vacation delights"), but we didn't expect this or the [lively Polish music and colorful costumes.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-photo-poland-krakow-dumpling-festival-pierogi-value-of-vacations-for-kids-world-peace.html "Lively polish music and traditonal clothes")Â   
I love Chinese dumplings but never had Polish Pierogi before and had no idea how scrumptious typical Polish food is. There were actually mostly locals there and we felt very fortunate to be able to sample and pig out on all kinds of dumplings.  
  
Isn't tasting local food one of the [true delights of trave](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "true delights of travel")l?

Even better when you discover them by surprise like we did here, [found cheese in Amsterdam](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/divine-cheese-a.html "cheese in Amsterdam"), [stand out meals Prague](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/11/stand-out-meals.html "stand out meals in Prague"), [reindeer meat in Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html#more "reindeer meat in Sweden"), and many more places.  
  
What happy food and travel memories do you have?

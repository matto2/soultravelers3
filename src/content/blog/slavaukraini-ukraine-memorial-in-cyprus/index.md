Like most, I am still in a state of shock over [Putin's horrible invasion of Ukraine](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/03/putins-war-on-ukraine-world-change-travel.html) and how that has changed and devastated our world and we continue to [pray for peace](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/world-peace-love-and-happiness.html). Today is [President's Day](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/01/family-travel-photospain-obama-inauguration-09.html) in USA & the eve of Putin's criminal invasion of Ukraine last year,  so it was thrilling to see that Biden flew into Kyiv to support peace!! Every day as I enjoy my Finikoudes  [beach](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/california-winter-beach-escape-.html) [grounding](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/grounding-earthing-nature-better-health.html) walk in [Larnaca, Cyprus](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/02/larnaca-travel-tips-.html), I pass a very moving Ukraine [flower](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/02/5-places-to-visit-to-see-beautiful-winter-flowers.html#more)s, flag & painted rocks  Memorial.

Every day tons of people show respect, pray and/or honor those who have died in this senseless war. Cyprus has been deeply affected even more than most countries by this war as it has a large Russian and Ukraine expat communities and has long had tons of tourists from those countries. So  Covid & the war harmed it greatly,

“**Cyprus remains one of the best places for immigrants from [Russia, Ukraine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/23/cyprus-russian-expat-tech-workers/) or Belarus in the entire European Union**.” According to Reshetnikov's estimates, up to 50,000 people have moved to Cyprus since February, mostly Russians and Ukrainians looking to start a new life away from the war.

I don't know all the details and mostly I can just pray for Ukraine and the quick end to this war.I have visited Ukraine and Russia and have friends in both countries, so I pray that this war ends soon! President Biden's surprise visit to Kyiv today was the first time in history that a US president entered a war zone where there isn't an active American military presence. As air-raid sirens blared around them, Biden and Zelensky stood firm and showed that Democracy will never fall to Vladimir Putin. What a statement as the vast majority of Americas and Europeans support Ukraine as it is the path to democracy and peace for all of Europe, the west and our world![![Ukraine attacked by russia biden visits Kyiv on Presidents day to support against Putin ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b685291458200d.jpg "Ukraine attacked by russia biden visits Kyiv on Presidents day to support against Putin ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b685291458200d-1536x1060-1.jpg)

It is heartbreaking that it has gone on this long and so many have died and suffered. It is also inspiring to see all that Cyprus has done and risked to support Ukraine.

 I hope the world learns soon that war is senseless and horrible.I think McFaul is right and we are seeing the [end of Putinism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/24/putin-ukraine-war-legitimacy-support/)!  "All we are saying is give peace a chance"!!

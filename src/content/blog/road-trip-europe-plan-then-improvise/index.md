This is our fifth year of doing extensive 3 to 7 month [road trips around Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "road trips around Europe"),  so we have it down to an art form now. I've written about our many road trips and our 4th [Grand Tour of Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "grand tour of europe")  last year, along with [best campsites in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "best campsites in europe"), [tent camping](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/big-tent-camping-in-europe-glamping-european-style-frugal-minimalist-luxury-backpacking-flashpacking.html "tent camping in europe") and [best books for camping Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/big-tent-camping-in-europe-glamping-european-style-frugal-minimalist-luxury-backpacking-flashpacking.html "best books for camping europe") to name a few. Free [kids clubs in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "kid's clubs in Europe for family travel") also make it a language-learning fun time for families.  
  
Partly, [how we travel the world so cheaply](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "how we travel the world so cheaply") on just 23 dollars a day per person in expensive areas like Europe, Australia and [Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora"), is we know the [secrets of camping Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/01/our-3-best-kept-family-travel-secrets-adventure-4-years-on-the-road-meme-family-travel-around-the-wo.html "secrets of camping europe") in a motorhome. In my [top 10 family travel tips](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html "top 10 family travel tips") I list traveling in an RV as my number one tip. Home on wheels, no packing, meet locals, every amenity, cheap... are a few of the benefits. A motorhome is our base, but we also do cottages, pensions, budget hotels, B&B's, luxury hotels and more, plus trains, buses, bikes, sail boats and ferries.

Hanging out at one of the three pools like our daughter is doing in the above photo, at our favorite [Barcelona beach resort](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "barcelona beach resort") with sea views and yummy croissants, is always part of our plan. We have [dear friends](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "dear friends in barcelona") that live here and actually know quite a few people by returning every year and beautiful Barcelona is very handy to ferry to Italy or travel to France or even the UK. Not to mention the great price of 17 euros a night!  
  
If you read our blog, you know we have been planning to get to the Swiss Alps, Lake Como, Corsica, Sardinia, etc for a while. We planned to see the first two this year for sure, but life has a way of happening while we make plans, so we always go with the flow and our plans are always flexible because there is always next year for us.  
  
Remember our dear [friends from Sweden](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html "eating in kota in sweden reindeer meat")? We have sooo many stories yet to tell about our [idyllic time in Sweden](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/funniest-kids-soultravelers3-family-travel-best-funny-youtube-global-kids-hilarious-sweden-trumpet-v.html "sweden family vacation") and it was all thanks to this wonderful family. They have decided to come visit us in Barcelona so we can vacation together here. Thus,  we coordinated our time for late July and will do France, Swiss Alps and Lake Como next year. Last year it was old friends from California, visiting us here, this year Sweden.

We've [toured France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/04/paris-france-travel-guide-by-mozart.html "paris guide tour france") extensively, over the years,  again [last year](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html "visiting Colliore france") ( but still have more we want to see and revisit), have also spent a ton of [time in Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/7-best-reasons-to-travel-cinque-terre-italy.html "why vacation in Cinque terre, Italy") ( but will always want to do more) and we have seen Switzerland, but want to do an extended stay in the Alps in summer. We have time though, and the number one rule in travel, is flexibility and improvise. Slow travel also suits us.  
  
When I broke my arm [biking the Danube](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "biking the danube"), we had to give up our plans for Romania and other places which was disappointing. But we have just been invited to Romania, so will be spending most of August there probably, celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary in nearby Budapest. Exciting!  
  
I haven't forgotten the third post on [How to Raise a Bilingual or Multi-lingual Child,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "how to raise a bilingual or multi-lingual child") I've just been busy behind the scenes booking and planning things for our [U.S.A road trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "usa road trip") this fall along with our August sojourn into Romania and swim dates here with kiddo. I will try to get that up this weekend!  
  
What are your summer plans?

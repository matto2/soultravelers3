As the sun sets on the beautiful Art Deco historic district, the famous Ocean Drive heats up with the luxurious Latin beat of Miami Beach's famous South Beach stroll with cool tropical breezes, glamorously dressed people, exotic cars and neon lights.  
  
This is the hot night club area of Miami, but also [fun in the sun](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/florida-family-vacation-fun.html "fun in the sun florida") during the day,Â  great shopping and fabulous food. The Historic Preservation, tropical ambiance and international crowd gives it a special flavor like no other place.  
  
On our [Florida road trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "florida road trip family vacation"), we loved our time at the charming [Betsy Hotel](http://www.thebetsyhotel.com/ "the betsy hotel") which put us in the center of the action. We will be writing a review soon, but wanted families with kids to know that South Beach is a great destination for the whole family. It is a very walkable area which makes it very handy with kids.  
  
Our tween thought it was the cat's meow and loved dolling up and walking along the beach under a full moon and people-watching along the many cafes, restaurants and clubs on Ocean Drive. Of course we had a ball during the day time, but we don't often have sophisticated vibrant night life on our [world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family world tour"), so we all really enjoyed this surprise.

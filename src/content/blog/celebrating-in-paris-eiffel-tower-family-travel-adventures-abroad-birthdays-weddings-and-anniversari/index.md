There could hardly be a better place to celebrate than [Paris](http://en.parisinfo.com/), one of the most beautiful places on earth. It's the city of light and love for singles and couples, but perhaps even better for [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) because it is full of [travel icons](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/sun-arc-de-triu.html) which kids love. On [our family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) we have had two [celebrations in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html) that we will never forget.

Before we even left for our world tour in 2006, I decided [Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris) and even more specifically, the [Eiffel Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower), would be the perfect place to [excite a five year old about travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/madeline-linea.html) and give her [a world traveling goal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/notre-dame-left.html) to look forward to. We planned an exciting [6th birthday for her in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html), including going to the top of the Eiffel Tower at night and riding on the merry-go-round. She even had an Eiffel Tower decoration on her cake at our [going away PJ party](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/suite-bon-voyag.html) and we got lots of [kids books about Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/books_travel_books_for_kids/) to [add to her education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/3-museums-in-a.html) and anticipation.

When we recently returned to Paris for several weeks, four years later with our daughter now almost 10, it happened to coincide with our 19th wedding anniversary. I hadn't planned anything, so at the last minute I asked for ideas on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/marismith?v=wall#%21/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187) and got tons of fantastic ideas. We wanted to do them all and perhaps we will in time, but ended up voting for a relaxing day enjoying our spectacular view right on the banks of the Seine in the morning, exploring the Rodin Museum and then a "pique nique" at Le Tour Eiffel which was just perfect. We ended with a romantic  boat ride at night taking in the lighted views.

The day even started out magical as we had already been in Paris for a couple of weeks, but as we awoke, we were greeted by seven swans a swimming just feet away from our RV on the banks of the Seine!  We had one of the best sites in this [popular Paris campground](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g187147-d296034-Reviews-Camping_International_de_Maisons_Laffitte-Paris_Ile_de_France.html), ( site Q18) with spectacular and peaceful Seine river views to enjoy morning and night between touring, but this happened to be the first time that we saw any swans. Last years, 18th wedding anniversary ended with a [travel disaster,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-/comments/page/2/) so we thought this was a joyful omen. Mozart was delighted to feed this addition to her menangerie of ducks, seagulls and stray cat that she fed each morning.

I had been wanting to see the [Musee Rodin](http://www.musee-rodin.fr/welcome.htm) in my last several visits to Paris, but some how kept running out of time, but since it is not far from the Eiffel Tower, it was a perfect addition to our day. We don't usually buy midday treats ( we usually bring our own) , but the cafe on the grounds there was a good spot to relaxt so we indulged in a few delicious French style snacks. I got some strawberries with basil, a simple, but winning combination I would never have thought of, yet will now definitely add it to my healthy treat repetoir.

I have seen the Eiffel Tower so many times in my life, yet somehow it still impresses me every time. The crowd always seems to be a happy one, most just seeing it for the first time and everybody getting that classic " me and Eiffel" photo op. We did ours and video from several angles before settling down to the perfect picnic spot. Mozart loves picnics, our first date was a very special picnic at a deserted beach, so what could be better to celebrate 19 years of wedded bliss in a luxurious, but low cost way?

The Eiffel Tower has now become "our" Paris icon for celebrations. We often see brides when we travel ( which I will write a post about soon) and we did that day. Perhaps that made an impression on our Ms. Mozart as she said to me a few days later that she was "going to get married at the Eiffel Tower, mark my words". We'll see. She did get to pour our wine and take lots of kissing pictures of us that day,  which she loved and before we left she ended up with a French beret and pretty Paris scarf which made her feel very French and tre chic. She also got five little Eiffel Tower key chains that she can not wait to give to her best friends.

After our leisurely picnic we made our way to the left bank  and rode a river boat to see all of Paris from that magical night perspective, including  the totally lit up and sparkling "Le Tour Eiffel". ( More details on the river boat ride coming soon).  All and all, I'd say a perfect Soultravelers3 celebration and 19th wedding anniversary to remember forever!

Means Beautiful Baby Camel  
  
One of our great joys on  
our trip to Jordan was  
meeting up with two baby camels

One of our great joys on our [trip to Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "Trip to Jordan family style") was meeting up with two baby camels while doing a jeep tour of [Wadi Rum](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/wadi-rum-bedouin-honeymoon-suite-.html "wadi rum") after [visiting Petra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "Visiting Petra").  Seeing camels run so fast and wild in this awe-inspiring desert of [Bedouins](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/bedouins-in-jordan.html "bedouins") and D. H. Lawrence was a thrill. Our 10 year old was so happy to get close up to the babies as she loves baby anything and has become quite the camel rider on our [family world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world famly trip")!  
  
"When we get out of the glass bottle of our ego and when we escape like the squirrels in the cage of our personality and get into the forest again, we shall shiver with cold and fright. But things will happen to us so that we don't know ourselves. Cool, unlying life will rush in. D. H. Lawrence  
  
We had no cold and fright, but "unlying life" definitely rushed in!  Isn't that a great quote about travel? We have seen camels before but seeing this one which was only a few days old in such a special place was a treat for the whole family.  
  
I still have so much to write about Wadi Rum and our wonderful vacation in Jordan, but still catching up and healing. Here are a few more posts on Jordan:

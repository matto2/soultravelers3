Do you have a nose for sniffing out the best travel secrets in both well worn tourist areas as well as off the beaten track? Friends  have always told me I have a talent for this and it certainly is a passion of mine as I want to see every area like an insider and not just on the ordinary tourists circuit.

No worries if this doesn't happen to be your strong suit because the ever growing community of travel bloggers  are here to help, thanks to [a meme](http://www.tripbase.com/blog/tripbase-blog-tag/) that [Katie from Tripbase](http://www.tripbase.com/blog/my-3-best-kept-travel-secrets/) started. She tagged 5 bloggers in November to start things off with their 3 travel secrets:

Carrie, [My Several Worlds](http://www.myseveralworlds.com/ "My Several Worlds") Erica, [Travel Blissful](http://www.travelblissful.com/ "Travel Blissful"), Beth, [Wanderlust and Lipstick](http://wanderlustandlipstick.com/ "Wanderlust and Lipstick"), Nora, [The Professional Hobo,](http://theprofessionalhobo.com/ "Professional Hobo") and Liz, [Travelogged](http://www.travelogged.com/ "Travelogged").

It's been making the rounds ever since and you might have seen them on  [Miss Expatica](http://missexpatria.wordpress.com/),  from Caitlin at [Roaming Tales](http://www.roamingtales.com/),  Audrey and Daniel at [Uncornered Market](http://www.uncorneredmarket.com/) , Jodi from [Legal Nomads](http://www.legalnomads.blogspot.com/ "Legal Nomads"), Sherry from [Ottsworld](http://www.ottsworld.com/),  Nicole from [Livingston, I Presume](http://rosenleaf.typepad.com/livingstonipresume/ "Livingston, I Presume"), Bernard and Danielle from [Border Jumpers](http://www.borderjumpers.org "Border Jumpers"), Lola from [Geotraveler’s Niche](http://www.lolaakinmade.com "Geotraveler's Niche"), Heather from [Heather on Her Travels](http://www.heatheronhertravels.com/my-top-three-travel-secrets-and-a-game-of-tag/) and many more! Here is a list of [who has been tagged so far.](http://www.tripbase.com/blog/travel-bloggers-tagged-so-far/)

Well into our 4th year of travel, 32 countries and over 175,000 miles traveled, (most overland) thus far on our world tour and we have found sooo many travel secrets, that it is achingly hard to narrow it down to just 3, but we'll give it our best shot. Extended family travel is our specialty, but these secrets will work just as well for singles,  couples or a combination [like multi-generational.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/marbella.html#more) 

We were very flattered to be considered a "travel guru" in this weeks [UK Guardian'](http://www.guardian.co.uk/) s Sunday article "[The Travel Guru's Guide to 2010" t](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/jan/03/travel-gurus-2010-guide?page=all)hanks to [Benji Lanyado.](http://twitter.com/benjilanyado) and I named a good travel secret in Tuscany there, but I will focus on 3 new ones here.

**TRAVEL SECRET #1**

 **[![Galicia, beautiful beach, child runing on beach, Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833012876d48a61970c.jpg "Galicia, beautiful beach, child runing on beach, Spain")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833012876d48a61970c.jpg)  
   
Galicia in Summer!**

It astounds me that this [stunning and pristine area,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/gorgeous-galici.html) perhaps the [prettiest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/more-galician-b.html) in all of Europe, is empty even in the summer high season! It is truly  breathtaking and not to be missed, but few see it except those that make the Pilgrimage to [Santiago de Compostela](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/santiago-de-com.html). As great as the pilgrimage experience is, Galicia is a large area and all of it is spectacular and [even most pilgrims](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/finistere-the-e.html) see little of it. The food is also delicious and [we highly recommend this restaurant.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/post.html)

**TRAVEL SECRET #2**

**[![Sahara camel trek, Morocco with kids](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330120a7d214ab970b.jpg "Sahara camel trek, Morocco with kids")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330120a7d214ab970b.jpg)

**Best People and Place To Do Sahara Camel Trek**

If you want a [stunning and authentic  experienc](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html)e in [the Sahara](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html), then [Les Nomades](http://www.nomadsaharabivouacmerzouga.com/) are the people to pick. I did a LOT of research on this before going, including [talking to experts](http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/5beaa/), who [had lived in and knew](http://www.joaoleitaofoto.com/) the area well, and that more than paid off in our experience. If you are a twentysomething single, you might think getting food poisoning or bed bugs is part of the fun (we read about such things happening there with lesser outfits), but when you travel as a family with a young child, you want your exotic travel to be safe, educational, authentic, unique and without problems. You couldn't be in better hands than with [Alessandra,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/alessandra.html) who was simply extraordinary. She, her Berber husband and their family made this experience one of the highlights of our open ended world tour and I can't recommend them high enough.We were so impressed with the deep Sahara experience  that we think this should be on everyone's bucket list.

**TRAVEL SECRET #3**  

[![pool, vacation, Bordeaux, tropical, vineyards, digital nomad, camping](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330120a7bb7964970b.jpg "pool, vacation, Bordeaux, tropical, vineyards, digital nomad, camping")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330120a7bb7964970b.jpg)  

**Best and Cheapest Way To See Europe**

Most American's [miss this secret,](http://www.transitionsabroad.com/publications/magazine/0411/motor_homing_in_europe.shtml) but it's not a secret to most Europeans or  travelers from Australia, New Zealand or even people from Korean and China that we have met.Yet, we almost never see American's so this bears [repeating](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html). There is not a city or sight in Europe that doesn't have a campsite nearby and almost all have cottages to rent as well as places for RV's and tents. They are often spectacular resorts perfect for families at very low prices. Above you can see DaVinci working on his laptop at [our campsite in Bordeaux](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/biking-st-emilion-bordeaux-vineyards-in-france-wine-country.html) between the water park and pool that was surrounded by the world's best vineyards, near a lake & a very short bike ride away from St. Emilion. [Dubrovnik](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/heavenly-holida.html#more), [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html), [Venice](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/italian-memoria.html#more), [Florence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/02/snow-in-florenc.html) & [Tuscany](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html) are just a few of our many favorites. Sometimes the price is as low as 11 dollars a night for total luxury!

**BONUS SECRET!**

**[![Crayfish, platter, foodie, food, party, Sweden, tradition](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833012876d4dc6e970c.jpg "Crayfish, platter, foodie, food, party, Sweden, tradition")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833012876d4dc6e970c.jpg)

Just for fun and for foodies, I'll add 3 restaurants that we loved! The [best real Mexican food in Europe  is Zorba's](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/hello-goodbye-s.html) in [Santorini](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h23I_qsofiA) with a spectacular caldera view. The best chicken that DaVinci ever ate was at the [gorgeous La Dame d’Aquitain in a thirteen century cryp](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/nothing-but-pin.html)t in the heart of Dijon, France in the Burgundy wine region. For the [best scrumptious traditional Czech food in Prague](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/11/stand-out-meals.html), check out the “Three Little Violins”.

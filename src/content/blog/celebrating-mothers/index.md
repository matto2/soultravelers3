I couldn't agree more with Ms. Onassis on this topic and as [older parents](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/retire-and-travel-the-world.html "retire early"), our primary purpose in life is to create heaven on earth together and raise one child well.

Once Mozart was here, I just didn't want to miss a minute of my miracle baby, this most prayed for gift that I named more than a decade before she was born ( given to me in meditation) and it was part of our wedding vows and reason for marriage.

Her mother ( who lost her mother at 7 and then her step-mother at 12) is one of the most loving people on the planet and is like an older sister to me. She just retired as a nurse, so has been able to be a great support to her youngest daughter through this process.

She is the youngest of 7 kids in a close knit family and my mother is the oldest and we grew up a block apart. Nuturiing and caregiving is part of our family legacy, as four of my aunts are nurses and I was too. This was the aunt who God sent to my mother on the night her [beloved husband passed away](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "death on the road, dealing with grief and travel") from cancer and she with another dear aunt nursed a brother who had a stroke for years (on top of their full time jobs and families).

May it be filled with Grace!

Winter blues? Escape to warm sunshine, clear water, [white sand beaches](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/florida-family-vacation-fun.html "white sand beaches") all on a super low budget by heading to this [paradise gem](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/tropical-paradise-at-budget-prices.html "cheap camping key west") near [Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/key-west-vacation.html "key west vacation"). This is [Bahia Honda](http://www.bahiahondapark.com/ "bahia honda"), one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It's a favorite spot with locals, but most tourists miss this gem.  
  
We are in [tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical Asia") enjoying the sun, (the cold of [China in December](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/the-great-wall-of-china.html "china great wall") seems a dream, as does winter snow photos on Facebook)  but for those in America and [Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Europe vacation") who are looking for a close- by [winter sun escape](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/endless-summer-joy-of-tropical-winter-travel.html "winter sun escape") on a tight budget, I highly recommend this place.  
  
On our [road trip to Florida](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "road trip florida") to visit [Harry Potters Wizarding World](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-kids-review.html "harry potter wizarding world kid review") in [Orlando](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/best-water-park-in-orlando-coco-key-resort.html "Orlando best water park - coco key"), we went to [Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/world-famous-key-west-sunset.html "Key west sunset") straight from wintry Germany. Lovely to leave a cold place and hit the sun and clear skies, plus a [good health](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/health-and-travel/ "health and travel") excuse for one's [Vitamin D](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/sun-for-its-health-benefits-.html "Sun benefits and Vitamin D") too.  
  
We use to come here and [camp](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34085-d113456-Reviews-Bahia_Honda_State_Park_Campgrounds-Big_Pine_Key_Florida_Keys_Florida.html "camping bahia honda") regularly when I was a kid. We'd swim, snorkel, explore, look for coconuts and conch shells, lie in the sun and hang out. This is a few feet from where we'd put our tent with ocean views and I had fun sharing the memories with my daughter.  I even came back as a young adult living in NYC as a cheap winter escape.  
  
Wishing you a sunny weekend, wheather it is in the [snow skiing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/skiing-in-southern-spain.html "snow skiing in Sierra Nevada mountains") or on the beach!

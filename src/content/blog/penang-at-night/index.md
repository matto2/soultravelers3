[Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang, malaysia") is known for it's exciting nightlife which is intricately connected to it's famous hawker stalls and night markets. Penang is very famous for it's food and eating culture. Many in Asia think it is the best in the world and even Singaporeans happily drive nine hours to enjoy the world-renown food. You'd be amazed at what they come up with, often just using a bicycle made into a mobile kitchen.  
  
One can almost feel the hustle and bustle of Gurney night life in this photo, where locals and tourists alike feast on Hawker food into the wee hours. There is also a booming nightlife in Batu Ferringhi centered at it's night market or " Pasar Malam" filled with makeshift stalls selling everything from food to clothes.  
  
In Georgetown throngs of people head out on weekends to varioius night clubs, pubs, karoke lounges, restaurants and discos. It is all quite entertaining for us, just as a people-watching activity as much as anything, so we dip into it from time to time.  
  
But mostly, we view night in Penang from our very peaceful high-rise apartment home with splendid views of all of Georgetown and the Andaman sea. Our [travel healt](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health")h issues and commitment to [eating healthy organic food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "eating healthy organic food") means we enjoy a different side of Penang.

There are so many benefits to long  
term travel that it is hard to narrow  
it down to just one "greatest benefit".

Our travels ( and our blog) have slowed down now that [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2017/11/mozart-dee-sings-on-born-this-way-tv-show-.html "Mozart Dee Sings on \"Born This Way\" TV Show!") has moved onto pursuing her acting career and singing and songwriting ( as well as a musician who plays five instruments).  Her world schooling allowed her to graduate high school at 14 and start college as well as her career very early. She is working with Grammy-winning producer Mikal Blue and will soon release her debut EP and album and those things take considerable time, focus and effort. Los Angeles is the mecca for TV, film and music, so it is our base for now and we're enjoying this new unique adventure. She has much to give to the world and our travels had a big part in that as well as her life-view that there are no limitations.

But this change has also given us time and the perspective to think about our decade of non-stop travel and how that has impacted Mozart and each one of us. Because she has taken an early college and career track, we see how much it is now and will continue to affect her life's journey. Languages and travel opens one's mind and possibilities.

The greatest benefit of long term family travel? The TIME we had together to enjoy each other, see the world, and just all the time to bond through adventures as well as just hanging out. Since we are older parents, one of our biggest motivations for our world tour was to not miss a moment with our one-and-only child, since childhood passes so quickly, and our travel really helped us do that, more than we ever expected. No matter how foreign or surprising our ever-changing exhilarating environment was, we always had the close, loving bond of our family-unit to anchor us. We thrived on being together 24/7 all 365 days a year.

Mozart grew up around the world with two stay-at-home-parents and world-schooling, so had more time with us than most kids ever get and that keeps us very close even today when we are on the much more sped up. fast-track of typical life in America. TIME is the greatest gift we are given in this life, so we do sometimes long for those endless-summer, care free days and truly cherish that gift we gave to ourselves. Ten amazing years of living-in-the moment and having boundless freedom to create each day as we pleased. As glorious as all the sights were, and all the freedom, all that TIME together was the greatest benefit.

We were really pleased to  experience the unique wellness travel tours and medical tourism available in [Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/best-things-to-do-in-beijing-china-.html "best things to do in Beijing") through [China Medical Tourism International](http://en.healthtourism.cn/te_aboutus_company/0/0.chtml "China Medical Tourism International").

If you [travel when sick](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "travel when sick") as I have done, perhaps you would be as fascinated by [Traditonal Chinese Medicine in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/traditional-chinese-medicine-in-asia.html "traditonal Chinese Medicine in Asia") as I have been. As many of you know I have been sharing my [travel health secrets](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html#more "travel health secrets") as I walk through my own [healing journey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html#more "healing journey") while [traveling the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "traveling the world nomad family travel"). TCM has helped more than anything and I have tried it on 3 continents, but it is best in Asia.  
  
Ever since  I had a [bike crash on the Danube](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "bike crash danube") and ended up in a foreign hospital needing surgery and paralyzing my dominant right arm for over a year and doing physical therapy in 6 countries, I've been dealing with [travel health issues.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html#more "travel and health") The blessing in this is how much I have learned along the way.

I am always blown away by this 2000 year old medicine system that somehow has found a way to make everything healing.

My personal favorite is ginseng because it looks cool and has also done wonders for me. I think it is the main reason I have my energy back and it has been proven in Western medicine as well.

I hope the photos can convey a little bit of the diversity in this museum. Most of the exhibits are in English and Chinese, but we also had a guide with  us to answer any specific questions.

I love sea horses, who knew they were healthy and part of Chinese medicine. I do find some strange things in my herbs, but none of these so far.

What an exciting weekend for [Soultravelers3](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/mozart-meeting-soultravelers3-blog-readers-around-the-world.html "soultravelers3 ")! Mozart met [Demi Lovato](http://demilovato.com/ "demi lovato")'s mom [Dianna De La Garza](https://twitter.com/DiannaDeLaGarza "dianna dellagarza") who is writing a book about guiding [talented children in singing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/tween-is-a-talented-singer-songwriter.html "mozart talented tween singer") and acting. Mozart is studying with the same great voice coach that taught Demi Lovato from childhood ( and she still works with her some).  
  
Mozart is a huge fan of Demi's and is always singing her songs around the house.  
  
**ROAD TO SINGING SUCCESS**  
  
Demi and [Selena Gomez](http://selenagomez.com/ "selena gomez") both grew up in [Dallas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/dallas-luxury-resort-arriving-to-big-d-in-style.html "DALLAS") and started their careers on Barney. They both studied acting and voice with the same coaches Mozart is working with here. ( Interestingly [Beyonce](http://www.beyonce.com/ "beyonce") also grew up in Texas and studied here as have many Grammy winners). The road to success takes lots of hard work and training.  
  
Demi has two other sisters in the business, [Dallas Lovato](https://twitter.com/dallaslovato "dallas lovato") and [Madison De La Garza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_De_La_Garza "madison delagarza"), so their mom has had much experience in this realm.  
  
"Faith and family are keys to success" Dianna De La Garza  
  
I couldn't agree more and really enjoyed a workshop Dianna gave about surviving the entertainment industry and am looking forward to reading the book. I do worry about the dark side of this business, so it was encouraging to see how kind, caring and supportive she is and how they remain close as a family.

**SAT SCORE CELEBRATION**  
  
The other great news we got this weekend, after waiting on pins and needles, is that Mozart did better than 96% of high school kids on her SAT at just 13!! She did exceptionally well in all three areas, math, verbal and essay, so qualifies for all the top courses/programs.  
  
She only had a month to study with a packed schedule with important [singing performances](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "Mozart beautiful teen singer and songwriter") like above, that gobbled up most of her SAT prep time as well as her [language students from around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/best-classes-or-tutor-for-spanish-english-or-mandarin-in-penang.html "best teacher for chinese and spanish is Mozart").  
  
**WHY TAKE SAT TEST IN 7TH GRADE**  
  
As a [middle school homeschooler](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/04/world-as-my-middle-school-the-atlantic-soultravelers3.html "middle school homeschool") or [worldschooler](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school or unschool education"), she has taken very few tests in life, so we didn't know how she would do. This amazing score allows her to do more exciting classes with [Johns Hopkins University CTY](http://cty.jhu.edu/ "cty") programs and other [Talent Search](http://epgy.stanford.edu/ "talent search")  college opportunities. We have loved every one of the Talent Search classes we have done, so look forward to more.  
  
**COLLEGES AND SAT SCORES**  
  
Most top colleges and internships ask for this 7th grade talent search qualifying creditial as it shows academic talent and a mature, focused student from a young age. She qualified for Talent Search at 6 or 7, but everyone has to requalify and retest in 7th grade. As a student who will [homeschool high schooL](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "HOMESCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL"), it seems especially important to be able to show this as it validates our educational methods.  
  
**LANGUAGES AND AP CLASSES**  
  
For a [kid interested in both singing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/06/wings-mozart-rocks-little-mix-and-lookssings-like-a-pop-star.html "Mozart sings and looks like a pop star ") and going to a top university, we want to plow through the requirements as quckly as possible, to give her time for her passions. Her [worldschooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world school and long term family travel") and being [fluent in 3 languages](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "fluent in 3 languages"), means that this summer she can easily take AP Mandarin and AP Spanish classes which will give her both high school and college credits.

**MORE GOOD NEWS**  
  
And the news gets even better this weekend. Mozart jumped for joy when she found out about the SAT but she broke down and sobbed for joy ( first time for her) when she found out the last bit of great news.  
  
Since May, Mozart has been auditioning for a highly coveted and competitive singing opportunity with three call-backs, against all older students from around the country, all with a LOT more experience.  
  
**SINGING AT SXSW AND NAMM**  
  
It's a special Masters Singing program that nurtures talent with tons of performances like at [SXSW](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/03/10/justin-bieber-sxsw_n_4934904.html "SXSW") in Austin and [NAMM](http://www.namm.org/thenammshow/2014/concerts-performances/jamey-geston "NAMM") in LA with gigs in New York City and Las Vegas, songwriting, musicianship and connects them to tops in the business who are looking for exceptional talent. WOW!  
  
2014 seems to be quite the intense roller coaster for our family, as we follow Mozart's passions! I must admit we parents have been thrown for a loop as we didn't expect this and there is so  much to learn on this road.  
  
Is this what the teen years are like, or is it just us?

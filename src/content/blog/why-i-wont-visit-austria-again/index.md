Thus, it is certainly not because we did not like Austria that will keep us from returning. Luckily, we have seen most of the country quite thoroughly.

Alas, I am still recovering from the [bike wreck I had on the Danube](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "travel disaster - bike wreck - hospital in foreign land") in Austria where I broke and paralyzed my right arm for over a year and needed surgery which turned me into a bionic worman and it was VERY painful and a long healing process.  
  
I am grateful for the good doctors who took care of me as I certainly could have landed in a worse spot, but the antibiotics given to me there, started my spiral into a severe digestion and chronic fatigue illness that I am just now slowly recovering from on my [healing journey.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "healing journey")

It is just no fun going to hospitals and riding in ambulances and almost dying in foreign lands, no matter lovely the country. English is quite rare in Austria and I speak no German.  I almost [bled to death](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/11/bloody-monday-i.html "beware you can bleed to death from a  nose bleed") on my first visit to Austria, so when I ended up in the hospital AGAIN, my second time, we decided no more Austria for us.  
  
Maybe it was all just crazy coincidence, but I just don't want to chance it again! Is there a country that you will not visit again?

Pools, water slides, water  
guns and water balloons,  
just all part of the fun

[Pools](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "pools"), [water slides](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html "water slides"), water balloons, [surfing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/family-travel-hawaii-learning-to-surf-in-kauai.html "surfing kid"), water guns, [fountains](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-austria-melk-joy-in-water.html "fountain joy") and [beaches galore](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "barcelona beaches").... just all part of the fun while [camping in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "Camping Europe")! What could be more fun on a hot summer day? It was an international group of boys and girls, the week our [friends from Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/funniest-kids-soultravelers3-family-travel-best-funny-youtube-global-kids-hilarious-sweden-trumpet-v.html "friends from sweden") visited us in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "barcelona").  
  
We're not usually at this family beach resort in high season Europe, ( to [avoid crowds and high prices](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html "avoid crowds and high prices")) but we made an exception this summer so that we could [vacation with friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html "vacation with friends") from Sweden. That week Mozart played mostly with her two Swedish "brothers" and three Belgium boys that we camped near by ( you can see one in the background).  
  
We were in [our motorhome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "Our motorhome"), our Swedish friends flew in  and stayed in a cottage and the Belgium family drove down and stayed in a [big tent](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/big-tent-camping-in-europe-glamping-european-style-frugal-minimalist-luxury-backpacking-flashpacking.html "big tent").  
  
They  spoke three different languages, but all the boys were learning some English in school so got to practice some of it and made due with charades when necessary. Of course, the language of "Water fun" needs no translation.  
  
I will be writing more about our time together as we had so much fun, but couldn't resist getting this joyful photo up on the blog. What water fun did you have this summer?

[Nomad list](https://nomadlist.com/warm-places-in-the-winter) says there are 429 winter warm places for [digital nomads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/08/-europes-cheapest-digital-nomad-haven-bansko.html#more), so the possibilities are endless, but we will narrow it down to ones that work best & intrigue  us, based on low prices, comfort & exciting environment. Also flights to and from one location to the next, figures into the budget and choice. Since we are [house hunting in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/07/americans-house-hunting-in-spain-home-buying-abroad-.html), staying not foo far, while doing the [Schengen shuffle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/04/top-tips-for-planning-a-summer-trip-to-europe-2022-cheaply.html#more), makes the most sense for us now.   
  
**ANDALUCIA  
  
[![Best Warm Winter Digital Nomad Destinations!  Andalucia southern spain ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302af1c91953a200d.jpg "Best Warm Winter Digital Nomad Destinations!

**Spain is our favorite country and Andalucia is a fantastic place to winter near mountains & beautiful beaches, cheap rent, good internet, friendly people, wonderful community celebrations, & returning to "our village" in the East of Malaga area worked well for our daughter to [immerse in the language](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html) & culture for five months every winter attending a local school in 1st through 4th grade creating deep [location independent friendships](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html)!   
  
**[![Best Warm Winter Digital Nomad Destinations!  remote work & world schooling ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302af14a7e4ce200b.jpg "Best Warm Winter Digital Nomad Destinations!  remote work & world schooling ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302af14a7e4ce200b.jpg)  
**As digital nomad & world schooling pioneers starting in 2005/6 when there were no iphones & wifi was often not available wandering Europe, we often had to make up our own ways to remote work & remote school. Plus one of our goals was to raise our child as fluent & literate in Mandarin Chinese & Spanish, and she played piano & violin, so this worked well for us. We did vanlife in Europe for 7 months wandering slowly & then wintered in a furnished rental home..always as a happy " 3 laptop family". Our daughter was mostly off tech, but it worked well when needed.

**BARCELONA  
  
** Another one of our favorite places is in the countryside near [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/04/21-of-the-best-things-to-do-in-barcelona-in-2022.html) and many spectacular beaches & we have spent a lot of time here over the years. We're house hunting here now & excited this will be our first xmas here.

We've done long s tay  vanlife camping as well as furnished apartment rentals here since 2006, so know the area well. People do camp here all year long, but the prices are also cheap for the bungalows, so we are in a 3 bedroom one now, but will return to camping here in our vintage camper van when we return in late April.

**CYPRUS  
  
**Our next digital nomad location will be in Larnaca, Cyprus with a two minute walk to the beach and very walkable old town! This will be our first time in this country, but it gets raves as a digital nomad destination as well as a popular holiday/vacation spot!

We will be there in off season from mid January through late April doing our "Schengen Shuffle" & have booked our flights and cute place to stay. We're looking forward to exploring the whole island & might even do some house hunting while there too. I will write more details once we spend some time there.

**PENANG

It is a great place if you love tropical weather, cheap prices, great street food, Indian, Malay & Chinese cultures as well as many expats. We prefer Europe and Med weather, but SE Asia is a great digital nomad destination & we are grateful that we got to know it so well.   
**TAHITI

Tahiti is one of my favorite places on this planet & I have lots of articles [here](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html) and [here](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/moorea-cheap-and-amazing.html) and [here](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/the-ultimate-tahiti-vacation-on-a-backpacker-low-budget.html) on my blog ( and more) about how to do it cheaply. It is not a digital nomad hot spot destination, but I would love to do a long stay there again and will look into it. Some have done it as remote workers, so why not us? My motto is "if there is a will, there is always a way".   
**MONTENEGRO  
  
[![Best Warm Winter Digital Nomad Destinations!  kotor montenegro   ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302af14a7e8db200b.jpg "Best Warm Winter Digital Nomad Destinations!  kotor montenegro   ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302af14a7e8db200b-150x150-1.jpg)  
  
**We loved going back to Kotor Riviera in Montenegro this past fall & would love to do a winter there as the beauty there is astounding, great prices, fast internet, historical sites and good people. We even did a little house hunting there for a possible investment property. [![Best Warm Winter Digital Nomad Destinations!

**CROATIA** We spent a lot of time this fall returning to Croatia and it is another wonderful possibility as it has a mild winter especially along the southern coast like Dubrovnik and that area.

**AFRICA, SOUTH AMERICA, BALI,**   
  
These locations are on my list and we will get to eventually as I am interested in exploring new areas as well as returning to places we love.   
  
Where is your favorite place to winter and why?

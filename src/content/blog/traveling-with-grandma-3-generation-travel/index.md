We have been blessed to do quite a lot of [3 generations travel with family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/family-arrives.html "3 generations of family travel") on our open ended world tour. We think [traveling with Grandpa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/spains-oldest-b.html "traveling with Grampa international "), Grandma and auntie [adds a special dimension to travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/la-mezquita.html "family travel with 3 generations to spain cordoba mezquita") that you can not get any other way. Memories that will last forever and bonding that is unique because travel expands everyone's boundaries and adds an extraordinary "aliveness". My Mom had planned to visit us in Spain that first year after we left in 2006, but her husband was diagnosed with Stage IV Cancer just before she was going to leave and that changed every thing and all of our lives.

We are sooo grateful that we had a [special 80th birthday 3 generations tour in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/andalusian-hors.html#more "3 generation family tour in spain ") with DaVinci's Dad ( and his sister) which was extra special because it was also their  first visit to their ancestral homeland. What a blessing for both Mozart and her Grandpa to [share a language, culture and experience together through that trip.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/sharing-village.html#more "travel to share language, culture and experience 3 generations together")  Even more poignant because he [passed over last June while we were traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/good-bye-dad-grandpa-family-death-afar-while-traveling-abroad.html "passed over while traveling").

There's 83 year old Grandma ( my mom) arriving yesterday after 24 plus hour plane rides from San Francisco to Hong Kong, to Singapore and onto Penang. She left her house around 7:00 P.M. on Thursday and arrived at our house around 4:00 P.M. on Saturday... so an extremely long, grueling  "day" of flying. She didn't even know how to work the TV monitor on her seat ( and didn't ask of course) but still managed to have a very nice flight on Singapore Air in coach, despite the 17 hour time difference and distance between our homes.

Mozart was so excited that even just hearing Grandma's laughter on the phone as she arrived with dad in a taxi made her "tingle with excitement". My mom looked and felt great despite the long flight and Mozart was soon catching her up on all her news including showing her some videos she had made in Bora Bora and Sydney during our recent travels.

Mozart made a "welcome Grandma" sign filled with hearts and lots of other art work for her and loved helping Grandma unpack.  We all ended up with some treats from home including Mozart's Christmas presents, much to her delight.

Last night and this morning was the most wonderful pajama party with Grandma -  a gabfest, catch up and time to share things like card games, we ordered Pizza in last night and had her favorite breakfast of French Toast.

Six weeks of this sounds magnificent to all of us as this window of time with an 83 year old Mom and Grandmother with a ten year old child must be savored as the blessing it is. We hope this [travel helps my mom with her healing transition after the recent death](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "travel helps healing transition after recent death") of her beloved husband.

Mozart enjoyed showing Grandma around the pool area and the workout room as my Mother is looking forward to getting a little sun and she loves to work out. She is healthy and in fantastic shape because she has worked out every day since she was 50, plus she is an avid golfer.

That is not hair dye, she naturally still has most of her auburn brunette hair as her side of the family doesn't grey much and it's why I almost have no gray hair in my late 50's. ( My dad on the other hand was completely white headed in his 30's). We just have old genes and I grew up with four great grandparents which was very unusual for my generation with relatives that did not marry young.

That said, we don't take anything for granted and cherish the time we have together. [Webcams help so much](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/thanksgiving-blessings-in-spain-.html "webcam calls help with travel and family at a distance") in our [world travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "family world travel lifestyle") and we had fun talking to my sister and brother-in-law who were in my mom's house handling things there. We all work together to get her here as it is a good environment to help her heal. I wanted her to come for 3 months, she first thought she'd do it for two weeks, but then we compromised to a 6 week visit. Instead of "The Eagle has landed" that one hears with the handlers of presidents and kings, we jokingly used the code word "Pink Powder Puff" when we were communicating about my mom while she was on her looong flight.

![lamp for chinese new year](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330148c7e719b9970c.jpg)

It is interesting and coincidental that it is almost Chinese New Year, which is a traditonal time where families gather in Asia for a reunion. Mozart is so looking forward to her first Chinese New Year in Asia and thilled that Grandma is here sharing in her life. We plan to enjoy the festivals here in Penang and we taking a little trip together as the "Soultravlers4" to the beautiful island of Langkawi and Thailand while Mozart is off from school.  That should be a fabulous 3 generations travel tour!

I want to thank my darling sister and brother-in-law, amazingly helpful wise travel friends  [@thetripchicks](http://twitter.com/thetripchicks "thetripchicks"), [@elliottng](http://twitter.com/elliottng "elliottng"), [EliteTravelGal](http://twitter.com/elitetravelgal "elitetravelgal"), [TravelingAnna](http://twitter.com/travelinganna "travelinganna"), [AlohaYaling](http://twitter.com/alohayaling "AlohaYaling") and [John Dekker from Surf City Travel](http://www.surfcitytravel.com/ "surf city travel") who booked the flight, for their help.

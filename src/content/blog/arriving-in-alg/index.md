How exciting it is to pass the border and enter a new country! Mozart always whoops and hollers!  It is even more exciting than crossing state lines in road trips that I remember as a kid, but the same general celebratory feel, minus the [Burma Shave signs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma-Shave). Entering Portugal from Southern Spain, one crosses a [dramatic bridge](Aerial view of river Guadiana and bridge between Spain and Portugal) that reminded me of the ones in Dubrovnik and Patras with its high span. It  is the Guadiana river that separates these two countries in this part of the Iberian peninsula.

We headed to [Camping Olhao](http://www.alanrogers.com/campsite-info.php?SiteARNo=PO8230) which would be our first stop in the [Algarve](http://www.portugal-info.net/algarve/index.htm) and it is one of the most popular winter homes for Northern European "snowbirds". It has lots of amenities like a large pool that is open all year, great kid's playground, restaurant and tennis courts plus it is  super cheap off season at only eight euros a night. There is  an even bigger discount for long stays. They had lovely shade trees, good showers  and I liked a little scare crow nearby a small garden and mansion.

One could get wifi from inside one's RV ( which was not so cheap, but worked out since the basic cost was so low), but the pitches in the areas near the wifi hotspot were the tiniest that we have seen. We did what we saw many people doing which was taking over two spaces since it was practically empty. The other alternative is to use wifi in a clubhouse or cheaper internet at reception, but we can get more done online if we have it available 24/7 in our RV as I often work on it when DaVinci and Mozart are asleep. Over all we were quite content here, so caught up online, talked to family and continued our vacation. We lose all track of time, especially while traveling, but spent about a week here.

There is nothing like the glorious colors of day break that can uplift us and give us hope. I so enjoy the sunrises here every morning and want to share them with you. Mostly I am taking weekends off from blogging these days, but want to wish you a good weekend and week ahead, so sharing a positive quote to go with this beauty.  
  
"I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality...I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word." Martin Luther King Jr.

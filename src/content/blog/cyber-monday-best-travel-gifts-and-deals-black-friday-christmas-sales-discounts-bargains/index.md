Everybody looks for [great deals on Black Friday](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=283155&tag=soultravelers-20&camp=15329&creative=385873&linkCode=ur1&adid=1M3Z2HSXD282PFXFPMZ3& "great deals on black friday") and [Cyber Monday,](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Friday-After-Thanksgiving-Sale/b/ref=nav_swm_cmon_nov282010?ie=UTF8&node=384082011&pf_rd_p=1279022442&pf_rd_s=nav-sitewide-msg&pf_rd_t=4201&pf_rd_i=navbar-4201&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=06188GJ0K1HQ46EBRAHC "cyber monday") especially in this economic climate, so why should travelers and those with wanderlust be any different? I'm not really partial to shopping, prefer to hang out in my jammies or comfies and we live a digital globetrotting lifestyle, so I do [most of my shopping online](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Friday-After-Thanksgiving-Sale/b/ref=nav_swm_cmon_nov282010?ie=UTF8&node=384082011&pf_rd_p=1279022442&pf_rd_s=nav-sitewide-msg&pf_rd_t=4201&pf_rd_i=navbar-4201&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=06188GJ0K1HQ46EBRAHC "most of my shopping online"). I've suggested [travel gifts for Christmas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/12/-gifts-for-travelers-with-soul-digital-nomad-gear-mac-familytravel-adventure.html "travel gifts for Christmas") before, but this year I found some new things and fabulous deals that might interest you, your favorite travelers or even non-travelers on your holiday list.

**GARMIN NUVI GPS**

One of our best decisions on our [family world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html "family world trip") has been our [Garmin Nuvi GPS](http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-3-5-Inch-Widescreen-Portable-Navigator/dp/B003DZ14EU/ref=br_lf_m_1247381011_1_6_ttl?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&pf_rd_p=1281583382&pf_rd_s=center-4&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_i=1247381011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=13M49W8DED4D941DWXFQ "Garmin Nuvi gps") and this one is better than ours and 68% OFF! Love the wifi feature which ours does not have, portability for walking or driving  and LOW price!

**FLIP ULTRAHD CAMCORDER**

Everyone raves about this ultra simple ultra fun, ulta amazing [Flip Video Camera](http://www.amazon.com/Flip-UltraHD-Video-Camera-Generation/dp/B0040702IE/ref=sr_1_2?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1290971742&sr=1-2 "flip video camera") and it's only 99 dollars! We don't have it yet, but it is on our wish list and looks ideal for kids and adults. So cute!

**CANON CAMERA**

I love this [Canon camera](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SX130IS-Stabilized-3-0-Inch/dp/B003ZSHNG8/ref=sr_1_1?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1290969972&sr=1-1 "canon camera"), use it for all my blog [photos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "photos") these days and this is a great price! You save 70 dollars! It's easy, very portable, and takes wonderful pictures, what more could you want?

**KINDLE**

We waited until the [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-3G-Wifi-White/dp/B002LVUX1W/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1290972198&sr=1-4 "kindle") prices came down and they added the free 3G ( no monthly payments, no annual contracts) and wifi. We just got it and love it! Not only can you read lots of free books ( there are ways to read them from many platforms) but the free 3G really comes in handy for travelers. We checked investments, tweeted and Mozart read her books while flying on a no wifi flight.

**ROSETTA STONE**  
**LANGUAGE SOFTWARE**

Ready to really commit to  learn a language? [Rosetta Stone](http://www.amazon.com/Rosetta-Stone-V4-TOTALe-Spanish/dp/1617160857/ref=br_lf_m_1199666_1_4_ttl?ie=UTF8&s=software&pf_rd_p=1282159202&pf_rd_s=center-5&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_i=1199666&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0169GBGWD1Z1CS5WB9Q5 "rosetta stone") is another product that many people rave about. I haven't tried it yet, but the reviews sound very promising. The 20% off helps as these are not cheap.I like it that many say it is an effective and fun way to learn.

**BOOKS**

We have reviewed MANY [books](ttp://www.amazon.com/b/ref=s9_ds_bw_brwse?_encoding=UTF8&node=3666021&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-10&pf_rd_r=17JX0M312BJZC5ND7TW7&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1281656922&pf_rd_i=384082011 "books"), just go to our sidebar on the left and click on some links under [books](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/books_family_travel/index.html "books"). Or if you are into camping, see my post about the [best books for camping Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/best-books-for-camping-europe-road-trip-european-rv-tent-or-cottage-bungalow-rental-vacation-holiday.html "best books for camping europe"). We love books so I have a large variety that we have loved from [kids' books](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/books_childrens_literature/index.html "kids books") to ones on investment and health, besides many great travel titles to enhance travel or armchair travel  for kids and adults.

Hope you had a great Thanksgiving weekend if you are one of our American readers. One of my favorite holidays! This year I have vowed to get my Christmas and holiday shopping done early, what about you?

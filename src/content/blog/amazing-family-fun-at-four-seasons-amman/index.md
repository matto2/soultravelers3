How lucky are can we get?  We've been traveling the world non-stop for the last five years to 42 countries on 5 continents so far and find [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) and a [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html) an awesome way to educate a child and have more time to bond.

In today's busy world, it is easy for families to go days without sitting down together, so family travel and vacations let everyone reconnect, rejuvenate and collect shared memories of special places.  
  
  
"I can't think of anything that excites a great sense of childlike wonder than to be in a country where you are ignorant of almost everything." Bill Bryson  
  

We're [monolinguals raising a trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "raising a trilingual child ") ( Mandarin, Spanish and English) and we've roamed the world by cargo ship, train, plane, bus, [sail boat](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/sailing-away.html "sail boat Turkey"), biking, [motorhome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-europe-plan-then-improvise.html "motorhome road trip europe"), car, [trekking](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html#more "trekking Bhutan"), [horseback](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/andalusian-hors.html "horseback riding andalusia"), camel and more. We even travel the word with a violin and piano and our daughter takes lessons with [teachers via webcams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ar90wOnWnM "piano teacher via webcam") on different continents.  

I've always heard wonderful things about [the exceptional hospitality in Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "exceptional hospitality in Jordan") and also how very special and family friendly the [Four Seasons Hotels](http://www.fourseasons.com/) are, so when we were invited to experience both, we couldn't wait! They both exceeded our expectations.

Despite having an amazing time riding a camel and [exploring Petra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html), boating on the Red Sea, meeting brand new baby camels in Wadi Rum, playing in mud plus floating in the Dead Sea and so much more, when asked what her favorite place in Jordan was, our 10 year old enthusiastically would say,  "The Four Seasons".  

In fact, our three nights at the [Four Seasons Amman](http://www.fourseasons.com/amman/ "four seasons amman")[,](http://www.fourseasons.com/amman/ "four seasons amman") is our daughter Mozart's favorite stay in our entire 5 year family world trip and that is saying a lot.

We've stayed in a tree house in Turkey, an African tent amongst wild animals inside a zoo in Sweden, elaborate [riads in Morocco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/number-1-riad.html "riads in Morocco"), a gulet sailboat along the Turquoise Riviera,  a [Mozart-themed room](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/super-7-salzbur.html "Mozart themed room Salzburg") in Salzburg, a house [couch surfing in Moorea, Tahiti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-french-polynesia-cheaply.html "couch surfing in Moorea Tahiti") with killer views, a luxury boutique hotel in a 5000 year old cave in Cappadoccia, a trendy hostel in Sydney, a sea view [resort in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "resort in Penang") and many resorts in our [RV in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "RV motorhome in Europe") to name a few. But Four Seasons Amman wins hands down.

"Be an explorer. The Universe is filled with wonder and magical things." Flavia

From the moment we arrived from a day of boating in the Red Sea after days of exploration in Petra, Wadi Rum,  eco-friendly Dana Reserve and more,  we knew we were in for a special treat.

Our gracious host Halla greeted us and whisked us away to our beautiful and inviting suite overlooking Amman where everything we needed to make it our "home in Jordan" was included ...even a child sized robe, slippers, DVD's, Wii, desk with the best internet connection that we have had for ages, an adorable stuffed toy camel, plus a truly delicious assortment of food waiting for us.   
   
[![IMG_3192](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301543399775d970c.jpg "IMG_3192")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301543399775d970c.jpg)  
  

We usually do slow travel, but since we had been invited to both Bhutan and Jordan, we had been going at a very fast pace for almost three weeks since we left Penang and Bangkok. We really needed those three nights in one place to catch our breath and the exceptional staff, service and luxurious surroundings healed us like a balm of Gilead in this historic country filled with sacred sites from many religions. 

The food in Jordan is phenomenal and the [Four Seasons](http://family.fourseasons.com/2011/06/golden-memories-of-amman/ "Four Seasons") flawless flair was breathtaking in taste, variety and stupendous selection, plus beautiful presentation which delighted every member of our family. We will be dreaming about that food for years to come. 

[![Four Seasons traditonal jordan breakfast](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833015432fe04a6970c.jpg "Four Seasons traditonal jordan breakfast")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833015432fe04a6970c.jpg)  
  

The first day, after a late luscious  breakfast, my husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed their Spa and massages with curative essences from the Dead Sea as well as whirlpool and sauna. Our 10 year old romped in the pool and we had a scrumptious lunch overlooking it as well as all of ancient Amman from our hill top, roof top location.

A highlight for my daughter was her surprise [cooking lesson with award winning Pastry Chef Anas Qsairi](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/cooking-at-four-seasons-amman.html) where she [baked cookies](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/cooking-at-four-seasons-amman.html "baked cookies") and got the secrets to the best chocolate chip cookies around. That is definitely a culinary journey that appeals to a tween and she declared it "awesome!".   
   
  [![IMG_3403](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301538fc63a30970b.jpg "IMG_3403")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301538fc63a30970b.jpg)  
  

Then it was off to HIgh Tea which was another seriously scrumptious enchantment.

  [![IMG_3472](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e89b99925970d.jpg "IMG_3472")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e89b99925970d.jpg)

 Later ordering room service and eating more exquisite food,then snuggling up in our wonderfully comfortable bed watching the classic " Lawrence of Arabia" is about as close to heaven as one can get in family travel in our book, because doing ordinary things in extraordinary places is the essence.

Kidlet and I were particularly fond of the sushi made with avocados. Imagine that, healthy and delectable! 

[![Jordan Amman citidel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e891e24e5970d.jpg "Jordan Amman citidel")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e891e24e5970d.jpg)  
  
We also really loved exploring exotic Amman the next day, especially the [Citadel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabal_al-Qal%27a "Citadel Amman"), one of 50 thousand archaeological sites in Jordan, that really impresses with it's majestic allure and historical significance.  
  
Then it was off to T[he Children's Museum Jordan](http://www.cmj.jo/ "children's museum jordan") which is the only one of it's kind in the Middle East. Our daughter loved all the exhibits, especially ones where she made a newscast on TV and created her own newspaper. She was also thrilled to meet some new friend like these very sociable school girls from Amman.  
  
[![IMG_3529](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833015432fe1cea970c.jpg "IMG_3529")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833015432fe1cea970c.jpg)  
  
  
We were so comfortable at the [Four Seasons Amman](http://www.facebook.com/FourSeasonsHotelAmman "four seasons amman") that it was hard to leave, for it's easy to adapt to such luxury and ultra hospitality,  but we had a plane to catch to Spain. We will be back someday to the [Hashmite Kingdom of Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "jordan vacation"), that [peaceful oasis in the Middle East](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "Jordan peaceful oasis in the middle east"), and to see our most obliging friends at this impeccable hotel.  
  
"Jordan itself is a beautiful country. It is wild, with limitless deserts where the Bedouin roam, but the mountains of the north are clothed in green forests, and where the Jordan River flows it is fertile and warm in winter. " King Hussein I  
  
We say, "Shukran" ( thanks you in Arabic)  to our special friends there for the happy memories that will last forever!  
  
Have YOU been to Jordan yet?

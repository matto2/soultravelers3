 Specatcular and majestic  rugged cliffs, awesome golden beaches, clear azure water make the [Napali Coast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81_Pali_Coast_State_Park "napali coast") on Kauai's north  shore one of the most beautiful pieces of paradise on earth which looks the same  today as it did when the first Hawaiians settled here centuries ago. Sailing this breathtaking coastal edge of Kauai is the perfect activity for families or for any age really, especially when you add dolphins, turtles and snorkeling to the mix!

We saw five or six large pods of dolphins which was really exciting even though we got to [swim with them close up in Portugal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DwI5p8a3UM "swimming with dolphins in portugal"), being with so many in the wild was thrilling and we also swam with [sea turtles like the ones we saw got to feed in Bora Bora.](http://twitpic.com/33vglh "feeding sea turtles in bora bora")

With these stunning views and tropical breezes blowing through our hair, we were all smiles and definitely feeling that famous aloha spirit. We couldn't help our selves from giving that [famous Hawaiian hand signal.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka_sign "famous hawaiian hand signal") The cascading waterfalls plummeting to the sea through velvety green cliffs just added to the polynesian flavored enchantment.

The weather was perfect the day we went and the swells were not high ( as they can be). We took this cruise on a catamaran through [Blue Dolphin Charters](http://www.kauaiboats.com/ "Blue Dolphin tours") and they were terrific. Seeing the amazing Na Pali Coast this way is the ultimate in ecotourism and adventure travel, even as a family or with me and my mobility challenges.

Snorkeling amongst dophins, tropical fish and sea turtles in such pristine waters was a delight and we enjoyed the yummy lunch on board with our small group and the crew.

A sailing trip to the Napali Coast is a highlight of any vacation to Hawaii and not to be missed as it is one of the most beautiful places on the planet.  On our way home, we saw one of the last plantations to close and Mozart bought a hula outfit as a souvenir to wear for Halloween when we were in [Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/happy-halloween-traveling-around-the-world-celebrations-for-kids.html "Bora Bora").

We want to thank the  [Hawaii Visitors and Conventions Bureau](http://www.hvcb.org/ "Hawaiian visitors and conventions bureau")  which sponsored this [wonderful family vacation to Kauai.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html "wonderful family vacation in Kauai") This sailing tour and our [surfing lessons in Kauai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/family-travel-hawaii-learning-to-surf-in-kauai.html "surfing lessons on Kauai") were dreams come true for our Mozart who has always wanted to visit Hawaii. I onced asked her why Hawaii ( since she has seen so much of the world) and she said, " I just love the name". It is indeed a fantasy name for a fantasy place!

Have you ever been to Kauai or sailed the Napali Coast? Do you dream of a tropical escape?

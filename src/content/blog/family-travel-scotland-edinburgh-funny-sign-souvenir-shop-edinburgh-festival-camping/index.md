Sometimes [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is about checking out funny signs and souvenir shops.We mostly just look , but Mozart loves it. This is a little shop in [Edinburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh) that we visited when we went to the famous  [Edinburgh Festival.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival) I'm part Scottish, so we could not resist buying the kilt, shirt, tam and Scottish wool knit sweater ( at a different shop or two).I haven't written much about the great time we had there yet, but we did do a [Youtube video about Scotland.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-jwBGqJ9zY) It's impossible to stay current with all of our travel,  as it's just too time consuming to blog while traveling non-stop as a family but I'll get it all up eventually. I'm often amazed that I have been doing this for going on five years now.

[Edinburgh](http://www.edinburgh.org/) is a gorgeous city and it is an amazing festival, but nonetheless, I couldn't resist sharing this little, some what tacky shop,  as tourist stores are often just part of the fun.We mostly shop with our eyes and Mozart collects little pins because they are fun to scout out and don't  take up much room. For those interested, we stayed at the [Edinburgh Caravan Club Campsite](http://www.caravanclub.co.uk/caravanclubapps/applications/uk%20sites/Site%20Details.aspx?csid=21873) which was quite lovely , convenient and we even had a view of a castle!

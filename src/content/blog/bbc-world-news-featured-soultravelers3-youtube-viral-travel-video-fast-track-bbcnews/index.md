Much to our surprise, this week our [Soultravelers3's first viral Youtube travel video](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3) was featured [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) thanks to the awesome [BBC News!](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) Friends in France, Australia, Georgia ( near Russia), Africa, UK and more kept seeing it during a travel segment on the [BBC World news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/) and telling us about it via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3), our [Soultravelers3 Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187?ref=ts) and many emails from our [contact page](http://soultravelers3new.local/contact-us.html). 

I am still stunned by the people who find us like the [Frugal Traveler](http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/qa-with-jeanne-dee-the-nomadic-family-traveler/) in the [New York Times](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html), or getting labeled as ["travel guru's" in the UK Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/jan/03/travel-gurus-2010-guide) and [now this!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Wau_epu-k) We wanted to see it too and put it [here on our Soultravelers3 website](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/where-in-heaven.html#more), but couldn't find it at first. Luckily, someone let us know with [the link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Wau_epu-k). Our 9 year old was especially excited because she has lots of British friends who always watch the BBC and she is the star and loves to keep track of our signature travel video,  [Where in Heaven is Mozart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4) and it's over 1.2 million views. We had no idea it would become so popular when we made it as mostly a special souvenir for her to remember our family travels around the world. 

It's on a show called [BBC's Fast Track Travel Program](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/8710381.stm) starring beautiful, clever and charming [Carmen Roberts](http://twitter.com/carmenlroberts) The tag line of the show is "Online Check-in the Fast Track guide to all that's weird and wonderful in travel on the web" so definitely fun to be included!

Our part doesn't start until the end of the show at 3.31 minute mark,  if you are in a hurry and want to zip and see that first. Carmen called us a cross between [Matt Harding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Harding) and "Little Miss Sunshine" (which Mozart got a kick out of) and told how we travel the world on just 25,000 dollars a year. Here is our whole original video from Youtube:

We DO have the next part of that world traveling montage video series ready now with many more countries featured as we have covered 32 countries, 175,000 miles and 4 continents since we did that one. But between writing our book and traveling, we haven't gotten it up yet, but will soon!

**Watch fast:track on the BBC World News channel on Fridays at 2230 GMT, Saturdays at 1230 and 1830 GMT or Sundays at 0730 GMT.**

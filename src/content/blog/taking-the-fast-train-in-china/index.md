Arriving at Beijing's South Station to take the super fast bullet train ( a distinctive pointed nose - their brand new "G" category) to [Shanghai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/shanghai-skyline-worlds-best-.html "Shanghai"), is more like being at an airport than a train station. It travels at 300km/186 miles an hour and arrives in under 5 hours in comfort ( and likely more reliable than a flight and as fast, counting travel and check-in time).  
  
  
I took this photo of train attendants who look a lot like flight attendants, as we waited to board our train. Quite impressive and also quite different from the older over-night train that we took from the Beijing West station to Xian, that I will write more about soon.

The beautiful grounds is what really touched us at Monserrate, plus the outside was in one of my favorite colors. There was a gorgeous lawn that Mozart wanted to roll down and she enjoyed seeing her first cork tree. The trees were really [exquisite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monserrate_Palace). I have a thing for big, [beautiful old trees](http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/features/index.cfm?uNewsID=22370) and we are forest people and gardeners at heart.  We all also enjoyed seeing the [Moorish features](http://www.portugalvirtual.pt/_tourism/costadelisboa/sintra/monser.html) and details which have become so familiar to us now.

We have had such a hard time finding time and places to upload the blog this year, that we are once again, a few countries behind real time. I thought I should take this opportunity to write less about Monserrate and [it's beautiful grounds](http://www.travelmail.co.uk/travel/Portugal/Lisbon/The-lost-gardens-of-Monserrate.html?article_id=18207) and share more through our photos in an attempt to try to close the gap a bit. We are going faster this year and that makes it harder to take time out for the blog and good internet access has been horrible.  I am often writing as we drive and the pictures are time consuming to manage, so sometimes I do them as we drive as well. Driving on the left in Ireland and the UK sometimes is quite difficult on small roads, so even that time is not always available as DaVinci often needs another pair of eyes and navigator.  

Nevertheless,  we had this lovely place  almost to ourselves and really enjoyed the peaceful serenity. We took the little train there and we were the only ones on it and they were kind enough to wait for us to tour ( which is not the usual role of train). They were a German couple who went out of their way for us and we really appreciated that. Some times being the last tourist of the day, has its advantages!

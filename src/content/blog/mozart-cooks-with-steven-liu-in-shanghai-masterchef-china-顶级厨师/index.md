Would you like to cook with a  [Master Chef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterChef_China "master chef steven liu") just like on the [TV](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/how-to-get-on-tv.html "How to get on TV") show? Mozart was blessed with this amazing opportunity when we stayed at the luxurious [Fairmont Peace Hotel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/fairmont-peace-hotel-shanghai-luxury-legend-review.html "Fairmont Peace Hotel").  
  
This was a delightful surprise when we arrived in [Shanghai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/shanghai-with-kids.html "Shanghai with kids") via the [fast train](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/taking-the-fast-train-in-china.html "fast train china") from [Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/best-things-to-do-in-beijing-china-.html "Best things to do in Beijing").

Executive Chef [Steven Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/steven-liu/7/572/ab5 "chef steven liu") worked with [Gordan Ramsay](http://www.gordonramsay.com/ "gordon ramsay chef") at the Savoy in [London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/05/london-with-kids.html "London with kids") ( the only Asian in a kitchen with dozens of chefs), as well as many other celebrated establishments around the world in 20 countries and is now the Culinary Ambassador for Fairmont Hotels & Resorts.

A Taiwan native, he is the youngest executive chef in China with a repution on the show as the "tough judge" but totally charming in person with an unwavering passion for great food and meticulous attention to detail. For a kid who loves to cook like Mozart, great chefs are revered as rock stars!

Having been trained in Western culinary arts, Chef Steven grew up with Chinese cuisine since his parents are both adept cooks and he joined them in the kitchen early. He did a marvelous demonstration of his renown cooking style with his signature dishes that combine the best of East and West.  
  
![food as art](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73ddc04d7970d.png)  
  
It was entertaining, luxurious, informative and one of the most scrumptious  meals we had in China.

Not to mention the gorgeous surroundings in this legendary hotel

In an exquisite room often used for weddings.  
  
![IMG_9677](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73ddc0087970d.jpg)  
  
Upon arrival, one look at what was in store for her made Mozart giddy with excitement.  
  
![beautiful food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd213e65970b.png)  
  
We were tantalized by the colorful fresh ingredients  
  
![MasterChef China 顶级厨师 Steven Liu ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd213e71970b.png)  
  
and the artistry with aplomb that Chef Steven put into every creation.

Yum! Savoring the tastes made the lessons extra fun  
  
![MasterChef China 顶级厨师 deliscious food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73ddc0512970d.png)  
  
and seeing deliscious food as a work of art.

It's very rewarding to learn the secrets of a master in an intimate class. Since Mozart is [fluent in Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent in Mandarin"), she understood whether he was [speaking in Chinese](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/best-classes-or-tutor-for-spanish-english-or-mandarin-in-penang.html "Mozart best tutor for Chinese ") or English.

After the private lesson it was time to sit down for the formal dinner.  
  
![IMG_9791](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd213b40970b.jpg)  
  
I ordered the beef which was grass-fed from Mongolia and perhaps the best I had in my life.  
  
![chefs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511d0c103970c.png)  
  
It was fascinating to see the other chefs arrive  
  
![soup](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd213eba970b.png)  
  
The first course was a sumblime soup.  
  
![MasterChef China 顶级厨师 Steven Liu cooking with travel teen Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511d0c119970c.png)  
  
Then Mozart, requested by Chef Steven, donned her gloves like the chefs to help out

and the fun begins as she is in charge of decorating this course correctly

and quckly before the dish is served to the guests.

Mozart's "boss" the Master Chef, makes her giggle.

Voila!

Nom, nom, nom! Heaven for the tastebuds and a most memorable meal  
  
![Soultravelers3](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd213f08970b.png)  
  
and evening that we will never forget.

Thanks so much Master Chef Steven and Fairmont!

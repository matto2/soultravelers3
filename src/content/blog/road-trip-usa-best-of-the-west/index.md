We are off and running in this  
new year and have been going  
at a pretty fast travel pace since

We are off and running in this new year and have been going at a pretty fast travel pace since we left [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/asia/ "Asia travel tips") suddently just before Christmas after our recent [trip to Australia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/australia/ "Australia travel tips").  
  
Ready to go with us on a [USA road trip?](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "road trip usa") We are psyched and energized after our [California winter beach escape](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/california-winter-beach-escape-.html#more "california winter beach escape")!  
  
Part of the reason for the pace is all that is going on behind the scenes with Mozart starring in her own inspiring travel show for kids as we have signed the first contract, but there are more steps along the way. We will keep you posted on that.  
  
One of our goals this year and as part of her [teenage homeschool](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool high school and world travel") plan, is to do more travel in her home country and North America. Thus this will be our first 6 months dedicated to that ( and other things) before we head back to Europe this summer ( which we are also really missing).  
  
We are off in early January planning stops in Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Santa Fe, Big Bend, El Paso, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas. If you have any great tips for this area let us know!

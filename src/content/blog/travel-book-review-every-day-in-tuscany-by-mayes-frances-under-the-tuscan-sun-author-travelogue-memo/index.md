You already know that we at [Soultravelers3 are passionate about travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) and [books,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html) but now that [I'm writing a book](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html), I'm looking more deeply than ever at travel books. I thought it was amazing timing when I was recently sent a copy of _Every Day in Tuscany: Seasons of an Italian Life_  by Frances Mayes to review.

Perhaps the most famous of all expats or travel writers who have escaped the rat race to discover their life's passion, Frances Mayes has started a whole cottage industry around her 1996 best-selling book _Under The Tuscan Sun: At Home in Italy._ Over the last twenty years, she has sold everything from furniture to olive oil to calendars and  photo books about her story and  this popular region. There have been others in this travelogue memoir sub-genre like Peter Mayle’s _A Year in Provence_, or the more recent Elizabeth Gilbert’s _Eat, Pray, Love_ and all three have been adapted to the silver screen.

[Our book](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html) has already been mostly compared to those three and recently someone wrote to us about movie rights about our story which has given me a whole different perspective on our journey. I haven't read any of them, but now they are all high on my list. I was delighted at the opportunity to sink into this one by  a brilliant writer about a country I lived in long ago and we [visit regularly on our open ended world tour.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/italy/index.html)

Mayes was a well known published poet and professor of creative writing before she wrote her first mega hit memoir, so it is no wonder that they call her "The Bard of Tuscany " as this is her third hit book on the topic. Her prose has a very lyrical style with detailed poetic descriptions and she is a master at personalizing her life in Italy...the shopping, eating, gardening, meal preparation and people... in a way that enchants and delights.

_A photo of Tuscany that we took this past  fall._

Library Journal says, _“The woman who single-handedly started the travel\-memoir craze returns with more on her life in Tuscany, including her purchase and renovation of a new house in a 13th-century village…can’t miss.”_

I especially enjoyed her evocative thoughts about her home ( which reminded me of [our Tuscan home in California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html) and the hard work of creating it, our Bramasole), the timeless beauty and simple, full life of the [Italian countryside](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/italy/index.html) and it's people  ( which reminded me in many ways of [our life in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/post-1.html) as well as my year in Italy) and the heartwarming passages about her grandchildren visiting her and absorbing  the new culture.I know full well how rewarding it is to expose a child to a new culture in deep ways.

_"At Bramasole, I learned to iron with my hands. Fold and smooth, fold then smooth, fold,smooth;the blue top sheet, lifted from the rack, smells of warm light. Flounces on the pillowcases yield to my flat hand; my yellow nightgown softens."_

[![stunning sunset, lion fountain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133ed16d734970b.png "stunning sunset, lion fountain")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133ed16d734970b.png)  

_"We'd go back to the United States and see the dreary "Children's menu": Chicken tenders, hamburgers, pizza, grilled cheese, hot dogs, corn dogs, and of course fries. Fries fries, fries--the horrifying predominance of the French fry in our diet explains a lot. In moderation ,a crisp little pile, yes. But everything comes with fries. Insane!_

_I don't think I've ever seen a separate children's menu in Tuscany. Isn't that a profound cultural cue? Children eat like their families and their families are eating as well as anyone on earth. "_

Food is definitely a dominant part of this book and it is her signature style to intersperse chapters with yummy looking Tuscan recipes. From roasted chestnuts to risotto with white truffles, there are luscious temptations for every foodie. 

_"Living well in time means taking back time_ _from the slave-masters--obligations, appointments, the dreary round of details that attach like leeches in a stagnant pond."_

That is my favorite quote in the book as it reinforces my "time is wealth" motto and what I remind myself about each day.  Early on she shares the Basho quote  "_Each day is a journey, and the journey itself is home"_ which reminds me of my own favorite quotes at the moment, _"The only journey is the one  within"_ by Rilke and _"The journey is my home"_ by Rukeyser.  

[Frances Mayes](http://www.francesmayesbooks.com/) is now 69 years old, much older than I am, but I could relate to many of her themes and wisdom gained from learning _"to revel in everyday life"_. [Every Day in Tuscany](http://www.amazon.com/Every-Day-Tuscany-Seasons-Italian/dp/0767929829/ref=pd_sim_b_4) celebrates her twenty years there and if you dream of a life in a new land or love travel,  food, history and art, [especially in Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/03/where-is-pinocc.html), you'll adore this book. 

Why not take a little vicarious trip to [Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/colors-of-italy.html#more) by picking  up all three: _[Under the Tuscan Sun](http://www.amazon.com/Under-Tuscan-Sun-Home-Italy/dp/B000HXDKIE/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0), [Bella Tuscany](http://www.amazon.com/Bella-Tuscany-Sweet-Life-Italy/dp/076790284X/ref=pd_sim_b_1)_ and [Every Day in Tuscany](http://www.amazon.com/Every-Day-Tuscany-Seasons-Italian/dp/0767929829/ref=pd_sim_b_4). These links will take you to our Amazon store where you can buy your own.Perfect for summer reading, escaping to a poetic life in the slow lane.

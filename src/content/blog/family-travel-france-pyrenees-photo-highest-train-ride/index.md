When we stayed in [beautiful Colliore](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html "beautiful  Colliore") where the [Pyrenees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees "Pyrenees") meet the sea in Catalan territory, we decided to take the special and unique Yellow train ( Le Train Jaune) from Villefranche de Conflent  to the high Pyrenees ( Pyrenees-Orientales). We were t[here in July](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/beach-fun-french-riviera-style-france-family-travel-bucket-and-spades-provence-south-of-france.html "French Riviera vacation"), but there was still some snow on the tops of the mountains. The yellow train is a not just a tourist train, but a regular train that has been running for over 100 years and the highest train ride in France. 

 It is a fun excursion for the whole family with spectacular views winding through the mountains a mile high. We got off in this high valley to see the Unesco World Heritage Site, [Mont-Louis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Louis "Mont-Louis") which was built by the famous French architect, [Vauban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauban "Vauban"). This was our beautiful view as we walked from the train to France's highest fort. Lovely, don't you think?

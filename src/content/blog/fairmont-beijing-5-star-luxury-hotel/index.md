It is immediately clear why the 5 star luxurious [Fairmont Beijing Hotel](http://www.fairmont.com/beijing/ "fairmont beijing hotel") has been rated the [best hotel in China](http://www.fairmont.com/beijing/hotelawards/ "best hotel in China") and ranked number one hotel in Beijing by Trip Advisor.  
  
As we arrived on our recent [trip to China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "trip to china"), we loved it's ideal location in the heart of Beijing's Central Business District since it was very convenient to my daughter's [Mandarin school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "mandarin school immersion Beijing") as we were there for [language learning](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/learning-mandarin-in-beijing-china-best-school.html "language learning Beijing, best school mandarin").

This is Beijings diplomatic and commercial district, so filled with high-end office towers, but the unique Chinese gate architecture and golden bronze color makes the Farimont pop out and it's conveniently close to everything including a subway stop. Thus it is an ideal base for a family like ours to [tour Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/best-things-to-do-in-beijing-china-.html "best of Beijing").

Like our stays at [San Francisco Fairmont](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/family-vacation-san-francisco-fairmont-review-family-friendly-best-luxury-hotel-with-kids.html "san francisco fairmont hotel"),  [Singapore Fairmont](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/03/top-hotel-for-luxury-fairmont-singapore.html "singapore Fairmont hotel") and Fairmont Peace Hotel in Shanghai,( that we will be writing about soon)  we were very impressed by the amazing staff and service.  
  
The warm colors, serene beauty and sun drenched interior makes one feel immediately at home. Davinci particularly loved the 52-foot-long glass sculpture in the lobby of a fish which represents wealth and prosperity in Chinese symbolism.

Our room was huge, the perfect sanctuary for this busy city with it's lush and enchanting East-meets- West ambiance. We stayed in a gorgeous Gold Deluxe room with access to the Gold Lounge and they provided an extra bed for our daughter.

After touring Beijing with it's 5,000-year-old culture and booming, vibrant, exotic city with it's six **[UNESCO World Heritage Sites](http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/cn)**, there is nothing like coming home to this spectacular room and hotel.  
  
Big props to Ms.  Karen Jacobo and Ms. Viva Li who made our stay so enchanting and the entire exemplary staff from the Chef to the Doormen.

This 485 square foot luxury room had everything you could possibly need and more. The bed was so big we actually decided to all just sleep together in it.  
  
The state-of-the-art work space with broadband and wireless high-speed internet options was greatly appreciated so we could keep up with the blog and our work. Mozart was a huge fan of the 42 inch plasma TV and we'd cuddle and watch a movie every night.

The huge walk in closet is one of my favorite luxuries at Fairmont hotels, since we do a lot of living out of a suitcase and even with few things, it's nice to  have that extra room when rushing here and there at a travel pace.

There is definitely some culture shock when arriving in [Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/life-in-china.html "life in Beijing"), much of it due to the language challenges and just how big this city is, so the "cocoon" of this special nurturing hotel and staff, so helped support us in our adjustment those  early days of our first week in Beijing.  
  
Most of our month was in a [homestay](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/best-homestay-living-with-a-family-in-china.html "best homestay in Beijing"), but we are very grateful for this time in extravagant style which helped us get acclimated to a new country.

Oooooh, and the giant  elegant, marble bathroom was beyond divine...talk about opulent comfort!

The sunken tub with it's own TV, separate shower room with a Chinese inspired 24 carot gold lantern rain shower,  heated floors, and the most ultra-lux Japanese-style electric toilet/bidet that we have ever seen!

The views from our room made waking up in Beijing, sunsets and watching the colorful lights at night exciting. Despite it being so central, I loved that there were also lots of trees in this area.

The attention to detail both big and small, creates the comforting environment.

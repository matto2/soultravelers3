We love and miss the joys of [camping Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/rv-in-europe-road-trip-europe-camping-european-style.html) and can't wait to [restore our vintage camper](http://soultravelers3new.local/2021/10/ready-for-post-pandemic-boomer-empty-nest-travel-.html#more) and share our journey with you!   
  
We've been focused on our daughter [Heavenly Reyna](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com), but she has now launched, so it is time for us to explore "boomer" travel as a couple, although I am sure she will come and visit too. Our RV is stored inside near Barcelona & we have not seen it since our [mother daughter trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2017/08/best-mother-daughter-trip-life-changing-adventures.html) & her [10 city solo concert tour.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2017/06/mozartignitetour-in-europe-mozart-dees-keynote-speech.html#more)

We've been talking on the phone and emailing our contacts in Europe and lining things up for this trip and new way of living. It looks like we will start in our favorite campsite near Barcelona as it is right next to where our camper is stored and we have wonderful local friends there. We have many things all lined up and are looking for the right mechanic to help us since it has been stored for a decade, so we need to be careful as we start it up and bring everything up to date.

I was so excited to talk last night to the RV and camping expert who sold us our 94 [Ford Rimor](https://www.instagram.com/rimorofficial/) back in 2005/6 as he knows all about campers, vans and RV's as he has been selling, renting, repairing them since 1972 and he thinks it will do great because we have maintained it so well and there are many older vintage campers on the road there! [Ford Rimor's](https://www.rimor.it/int/en) are very sturdy and it will be easy to replace & update anything we need.

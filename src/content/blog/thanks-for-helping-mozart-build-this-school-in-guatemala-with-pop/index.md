Great big gratitude hugs to all those who supported [Mozart's charity fundraiser](http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=290456 "RTW TEEN Mozart's fundraiser") with [Pencils of Promise](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/pencils-of-promise-help-us-build-a-school-in-.html "Mozart teen and pencils of promise charity") to build a school in Xecotz, Guatemala where it is badly needed.  
  
**GRATITUDE AND FANTASTIC NEWS**  
  
Together with POP we raised the $25,000 necessary to fund this school and 30 more! Here you can see Juana Cristina celebrating the opening of the new school in Xecotz.  
  
If you listened to 13 year old [Mozart's speech at the Global Education Conference](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/11/global-citizen-innovative-kid-speaker-at-global-education-conference.html#more "13 year old trilingual inspiring speech at Global Education Conference"), you know she has a passion for wanting to [make a difference in our world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/change-the-world-cambiar-el-mundo-%E6%94%B9%E5%8F%98%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-adorable-video-by-trilingual-mozart-.html "teen singer Mozart making a difference in the world").

**ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE**  
  
Mozart was thrilled with this news to find out that with us all working together we made a difference and the school is now here!  
  
What a fantastic lesson to learn first-hand as a young teen, that working together we CAN [change the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/kid-world-citizens-inspiring-speech-at-global-education-conference.html "Teen singer and travel kid Mozart speech about changing the world"). These kids are happy and Mozart is happy, so I thank you all from the bottom of my heart!

Maybe we will try to build another school next Christmas. What do you think? Doesn't it feel great?

How can I write about [Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "travel to Bhutan"), without writing about one of things that most shocks Western tourists who visit? Talking about [Bhutan's penis art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallus_paintings_in_Bhutan "Bhutan's Penis art") on a family travel blog, might seem strange, but it is a normal part of [Bhutanese life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/buddhist-bhutan-bliss.html "bhutanese buddhist life") and seen everywhere like the [beautiful Himalayan mountains](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/stunning-himalaya-travel-bhutan.html "beautiful himalayan mountains ") there.  
  
I think it might have been more surprising to us parents ( although I had read about it before going) than to our child, who was as nonchalant about it as she was about seeing the nudity of [David in Florence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/02/david-davinci-m.html "david in florence") or other such art and [sculpture around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-norway-oslo-vigeland-sculpture-park-mother-child.html "sculptures around the world").  
  
As a [global kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "global kid") she understands diversity and multiculturalism and even enjoyed it when we accidentally ended up at a German [nudist camp in Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/beauty-and-nake.html "nudist camp in Portugal"). She has seen all kinds of unusual things from [bone churches](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/salt-mine-iron.html "bone churches") to [harems and mosques](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/topaki-palace-b.html "harems and mosques") to participating in local [festivals with exotic costumes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html "exotic local festivals spain") etc, so just accepts it all as another fascinating facet of our world.  
  
These large phallic symbols are often put on the outside of the door of houses, shops and eateries in [Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/bhutan-happiest-place-on-earth--1.html "Bhutan") to protect them from evil spirits, prevent arguments, and promote fertility. They come in all kinds of sizes, eye-popping embellishments and color schemes. Some are even decorated with bows or colorful dragons.  
  
It's actually not that unusual in ancient societies and has long been an important symbol in many Asian societies in this part of the world. Hindus in both nearby India and Nepal [worship lingam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingam "worship lingam").  
  
Have you heard about or seen these famous phallic symbols in Bhutan?

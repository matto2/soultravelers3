Can you live a [nomadic lifestyle with children](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "How to live a nomadic travel life with children") in a way that will enrich them and prepare them for our fast changing world? Of course! It's easier today than ever before and there are many different ways to do this. We had our [fears](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/travel-distasters-vacation-nightmares.html "travel disasters and fears") and uncertainties before [world traveling with a school age child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "world traveling with a school age child"), but are so grateful for the amazing and beautiful people and places we have experienced [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world family travel").  
  
Is being a  [multilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "how to raise multilingual children") and multicultural world citizen a huge advantage for a 21st century student and [global kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "how to raise a global kid")?  Is [travel the best education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/travel-schooling-learning-through-travel.html "travel the best education")? After almost 7 years of traveling the world as a family non-stop to 44 countries on 5 continents on just $23/day per person, our answer is YES! I encourage everyone to find ways at home or through travel to give thier kids a greater global perspective which encourages world peace and understanding.

I grew up with a nomadic life..lots of moving ( often every 6 months) and travel ..and my three siblings and I all thrived on it. I loved it then and I can see how it contributed sooo much to my entire life. Some people thrive on living in one place forever and not traveling, but I think that would have hurt me and bored me to tears. I think my daughter was born to be an explorer, trilingual and digital nomadic kid!

Military brats, diplomatic, foreign correspondents, World Bank, missionary and  IMF kids  have been living peripatetic lifestyles forever with their families. The rich have always traveled, often nomadic for years in the 1600's to 1800's doing a "Grand Tour" for education and expansion. Just look at the [president](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2008/11/26/obamas-third-culture-team.html "president obama") and half the people in Washington to see that nomadic, world traveling can greatly enrich a life.  
  
"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. " Mark Twain

Today you don't have to be rich, expats  or in the military or other business to [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "how to travel the world") and raise global kids. ANYONE can do this and it's easier than ever to school and work ANY where as a [perpetual traveler.](perpetual%20traveler "perpetual travel")  I actually think doing this outside of the expat, diplomatic, foreign work, military or missionary route has way more advantages because the family is in charge instead of doing it on someone elses terms and timing. We can also skip the international school bubble and return regularly to world places and people that we love, so there is more consistency in friendships and life.

As monolingual parents who are raising a fluent as a native trilingual/triliterate ( Mandarin Chinese/Spanish/English) who have been traveling with her since she was 5 and she will soon be 12, we can honestly say this was the best decision of our lives. We can already see the tremendous benefits in who she has become and are so grateful for all the time togeher we've had with this choice.  
  
It is actually cheaper, easier and more rewarding than most people know, so if you want more freedom and time together, I highly recommend a world nomadic lifestyle as a family.

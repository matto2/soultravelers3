**PALEO TORTILLA ( GRAIN FREE, GLUTEN FREE) RECIPE**  
  
INGREDIENTS:  
  
2  Eggs  
  
1 teaspoon melted coconut oil  
  
1 tablespoon water  
  
1/4 cup Arrowroot powder  
  
1 teaspoon coconut flour  
  
pinch of salt  
  
( This makes 2 tortilla's so one can double this recipe or even quadruple it as Mozart often does, then stores the extra for other meals).  
  
![pour into skillet](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511ec3507970c.png)  
  
DIRECTIONS:  
  
1) Crack the eggs into a bowl and mix in the coconut oil and water.  
  
2) Add the dry ingredients and mix well to combine  
  
3) Pour about 1/3 of the batter into a frying pan (with coconut oil to prevent sticking) and use medium heat. Quickly roll the skillet around to evenly coat the bottom.  
  
4) Cook for about 1 minute on each side.  
  
**(You can just use this recipe as a base, you can add spices or herbs or any flavors you want to these**)

So easy that even a child can make them

They are a great partner with salsa

Or spices and avocado

They might look a little eggy, but the arrowroot powder

gives these a good texture and tortilla-like flavor

Mozart and DaVinci are very picky eaters and they love these

The arrowroot powder can sometimes irritate sensitive tummies, so I don't partake in these yet as they do not seem to agree with me ( although I love the taste). Arrowroot powder is not allowed on GAPS/SCO diet. I've come a long way on my [healing journey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "healing journey"), and feel much better, but am still healing. ( I have another recipe for tortillas made with plantains I sometimes use.)

 I can enjoy these Mexican style diced sweet potatoes ( that are delicious and taste nothing like sweet potatoes), but that is a whole other recipe. ( You can also use these tortilla/wraps for a sweet crepe if you add vanilla and Mozart even cuts them up sometimes and makes noodles or pasta!)

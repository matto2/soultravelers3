We wanted to get the most out of our short stay getaway at the best price, so booked an airbnb apartment on the beach near the airport.

Big cities tend to be intense with crowds, tourists & traffic, so we tend to like to stay in more relaxed areas (cheaper too) & go into the city ( like Rome) for the day as day trips and most of Europe makes that easy with great mass transit. I will do a review of the place we stayed at. We sometimes  use taxi's , ubers or transfers also to save time.

Also, Wizz ( budget) airline changed out flight that we had booked months ago, so  sadly, our flight now arrived after midnight, so being close to the airport made that easier & the airbnb owner picked us up.

Travel is always subject to change, so it keeps us on our toes and adaptable, even when it is unfair.

By accident, we ran into an amazing festival where Romans dress up like ancient Romans,  celebrating their amazing history. It is called “ _**Natale di Roma**_ “ and it is enchanting and surreal seeing Romans walking their ancient streets in outfits from their illustrious past.They have celebrated this holiday for eons!

There are an array of events that take place across Rome to celebrate its birthday which is April 21, but celebrated the first Sunday after that.

At the Pantheon at noon on this day, the  sunlight shines directly through the oculus opening in the dome illuminating the entrance door! The Pantheon was built nearly 2000 years ago & the ancient builders constructed the building to allow this to take place precisely on this date to honor Romes birthday. We missed it, but might catch it another year as the building alone dazzles.

The most magical part of the day was serendipitously discovering Romes largest park that was filled with local Romans picnicking and enjoy this glorious spring day on Romes birthday.

The Villa Borghese Gardens is the most popular park in Rome and absolutely stunning on this beautiful spring Sunday where Roman locals  were out, snuggling on the grass,  having picnics and enjoying lots of music buskers adding charming ambience to the flowers blooming and sunshine on it's 80 hectares.

The park has some amazing viewing platforms that offer stunning panoramas of Rome that will take your breath away and it was a perfect day to experience that.

It is funny because this is the exact same view we admired as we arrived in Rome at the airport in huge panoramic ads and we just happened to stumble upon it while wandering.

 and we heard and then saw opera singers busking in the park! How very Italian!! Suddenly it felt like we were in a movie with this wonderful soundtrack that fit so beautifully.

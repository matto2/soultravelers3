We have had the most wonderful [winter in tropical Asia.  Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html#more "winter in tropical asia, penang") has been a nurturing haven, full of delights, but it is time for us to move on to visit new countries and places ( like India, Jordan, and Bhutan on our way to Europe for the summer). Just like we [wintered in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "wintered in Spain") for four years, we arrived here in [Penang around Thanksgiving in late November.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/first-thanksgiving-in-asia.html "Penang november at thanksgiving") These five months have flown by sooo fast!  
  
The first winter in a new location is always the most challenging because one has to start from scratch with the deep immersion as clueless tourists in a foreign land, but now we have learned so much, thus feel like this is one of our homes. Next year will be MUCH easier because of the groundwork we did this winter, but of course always more to learn and see. One learns by doing!

It's been a very exciting  ( seeing new countries and continents like [French Polynesia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-french-polynesia-cheaply.html "French Polynesia"), [Australia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/the-stunning-sydney-harbour-yha-hostel-review.html "Austrailia"), [Kauai](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/sailing-the-stunning-napali-coast-of-kauai-hawaii-with-dolphins-snorkeling-fun.html "kauai"), [New Zealand](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/beautiful-new-zealand-kia-kaha.html "new zealand"), [Singapore](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/top-hotel-for-luxury-fairmont-singapore.html "sinapore"))  and also challenging travel year for us as we [lost two dads while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/good-bye-dad-grandpa-family-death-afar-while-traveling-abroad.html "lost dad at distant, died while traveling") which [changed everything](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "mourning while traveling") for us and our extended families, including our travel plans. Instead of going to Africa or South America this fall as planned previously, we've decided to do a USA road trip from Miami to San Francisco to show kidlet more of America and to visit relatives along the way and spend more time with family in California.  
  
Because our plates were full and I have been dealing with some health challenges, we did get to see everything we wanted to this year in Asia. This year was too intense on just making a home here, finding a Mandarin school and getting accustomed to a totally new routine and place, but there is always next year and probably a few more where we will winter in Asia, so we have time.

[83 year old Grandma came to visit us](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "Multi generational travel with grandma") in Penang for 6 weeks and we loved it and learned again how much we adore [multi-generational travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/family-arrives.html "multi-generational travel in  Europe") and time together. We hope to convince her to come again next winter and be the star again during [Chinese New Year](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Chinese new year"). We look forward to spending more time with her at her home in California and having our first Thanksgiving and  Christmas at home in almost 6 years.  
  
We came mainly for the [Mandarin and finding an all Chinese school in Asia for our daughter.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Mandarin chinese school in asia for our daughter") It was a much more difficult process than it was [putting her into a school in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "putting into a school in spain"), but we couldn't be more pleased. I am in the process of writing an update about her school, but you can tell by her recent [school big win,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/chinese-school-trophy-girl-.html "Chinese school big win") that she is happy and it is a good fit. We had a great meeting with them on Monday and they are going to work with us via Skype as we roam to keep her up on her Mandarin and make sure she stays up with her class, so she can rejoin her class when we return.  
  
There are so many stories still to tell and photos and videos to share, but there is only so much time in a day, so we get them up as we can. It's transition time for us as we complete everything before our take off on May 1st ( first stop Singapore) and say good bye to Penang and this fascinating, sweet,  first tropical winter. It's a bit bitter sweet, sad to leave on one level, but exciting towards new things. We'll be back to Spain by June 1st and looking forward to another exciting summer in Europe, meeting friends in London, Barcelona and the South of France and exploring new places like the Swiss Alps. Our hearts are filled with gratitude!

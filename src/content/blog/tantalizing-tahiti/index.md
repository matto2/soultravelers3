When you think Tahiti what comes to mind?  
  
Swaying palms, aquamarine lagoons, jagged mountains, thatched roof bungalows over clear water, white sand or black sand beaches and the colorful, fantasy paradise of Gauguin that soothes the soul.  Alas, also one thinks of outrageous priced luxury resorts that make it impossible for most to experience this tropical gem that sits invitingly, out in the middle of no where.  
  
We were so pleased to discover that we could [visit Tahiti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/happy-halloween-traveling-around-the-world-celebrations-for-kids.html "VISIT TAHITI"), [Bora Bora](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/bora-bora-heaven-on-a-cheap-budget.html#more "BORA BORA ON A CHEAP BUDGET") and Moorea on our 7 year [around-the-world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around-the-world family trip")  [family trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family extended world travel") and still stay on our cheap $23/day pp budget. Better yet ,we even got to know the locals and see the normal life of French Polynesia, like these guys selling fresh caught fish along the road side. We liked it so much, we might return for a long stay and immerse in a bit of kidlet's French there in this land of enchantment.  
  
Yes, we visited some of the luxury hotels for free ( like the locals do) as a day trip or to see a dance show, but actually preferred the more authentic parts of our experience and connecting with locals. We've really fallen in love with the spirit and heritage culture  of these people in [Hawaii](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html "Hawaii travel"), Tahiti and [New Zealand.

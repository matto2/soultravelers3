Have you been to beautiful New Zealand? Now is a perfect time to go or plan a trip. We've heard from many travelers, including travel icon [Wendy Perrin and her husband when we visited them for Halloween](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html "wendy perrin visiting them in october"), that New Zealand is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Thus it's long been on our bucket list and we finally made it this year.  
  
Alas, we didn't get more than a peek, but we will be back. This year we are doing a complete round-the-world trip so we started in Spain, then flew to [London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "London bbc interview"), New York City, [San Francisco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/family-vacation-san-francisco-fairmont-review-family-friendly-best-luxury-hotel-with-kids.html "san francisco family vacation"), Honolulu, [Kauai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/sailing-the-stunning-napali-coast-of-kauai-hawaii-with-dolphins-snorkeling-fun.html "Kauai, Hawaii"), San Francisco, Los Angeles, Papette, [Tahiti](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-french-polynesia-cheaply.html "Moorea french polynesia"), [Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora"), Papette, Auckland, then onto [Sydney](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/the-stunning-sydney-harbour-yha-hostel-review.html "sydney"), [Singapore](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/03/top-hotel-for-luxury-fairmont-singapore.html "singapore") and finally [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang") for the winter. We will soon make our way back to London and Spain, via stops in India and Jordan and possible Bhutan.  
  
Even we can't see everything, but we wanted to at least take a quick look at Auckland while in New Zealand. We loved the friendly people, kiwi marmite, and this view from the famous One Tree HIll. We stayed at the [Airport Bed & Breakfast](http://www.airportbnb.co.nz/aboutus.html "airport bed and breakfast") which is a fantastic budget place that we'll be writing more about. We can't wait to go back and do deep explorations of this gorgeous country. Having experienced and learned about other fascinating Polynesian people in [Kauai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html "kauai ") and Tahiti we are also eager to learn more about the Maori people.  
  
As most people know Christchurch, New Zealand was hit recently by their second large earthquake. We're joining other bloggers like [Perceptive Travel](http://perceptivetravel.com/blog/ "Perceptive travel") and [Matador Network](http://matadornetwork.com/ "Matador Network") in this weeks [#blog4NZ](http://blog4nz.indietravelmedia.com/ "blog4nz") event to help support the people of New Zealand. Our hometown of [Santa Cruz](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "santa cruz") was hit by a large earthquake when we lived there in 1989, so we know what that is like and how long it takes to rebuild. Tourism to New Zealand is one of the best things you can do to support this country.  
  
Kia Kaha are Maori words which mean be strong. We send blessings to the people of New Zealand plus Japan and Burma.

As many of you wake up, we're already basking in the beautiful [sunset here in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "APARTMENT IN PENANG SUNSET VIEWS"), taking in those relaxation vibes to [celebrate life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/mother-daughter-bonding-tips-for-tweens.html "MOTHER DAUGHTER BONDING RITUALS") this weekend. We're getting excited about and inspired by our upcoming trip to China and busy doing lots of prep to get ready as it will be here before we know it.  
  
Everyone in China has been celebrating and are off this week for the Mooncake or Mid-Autumn festival  
(the [Chinese community is celebrating](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "chinese community celebrations georgetown penang") here as well) so things will start to get more hectic next week and hopefully we will get our visa soon.  
  
What are your weekend plans? I will leave you with some inspiring quotes to ponder and more posts on sunrises and sunsets (with [7 years of non-stop world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "7 years of non-stop travel around the world"), this is only a small fraction). Hoping your sunset and weekend rocks!

I loved this sunset in Pensacola, Florida that I took in September while Mozart and her dad were buidling a sand castle in the pure white sand. It was an important location for me on our [road trip to Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "road trip florida") because it was a place that I use to vacation at when I was a kid, making my own sand castles. It was thrilling to share these memories with my own family.  
  
Almost every morning now,  we get to watch the sunrise here in California at my Mother's house near the sea and surrounded by redwoods and flowers. It's a fabulous way to start the day, although I must admit it plays some havoc as the windowed dining room where we see it best is also where we have set up our 3 computers, so hard to use during the rising. Yesterday we had to improvise and move her piano upstairs to our bedroom so we could see her instructor via webcam.

Nevertheless, I don't think there has ever been a sunset or sunrise that we have experienced that didn't bring up feelings of awe and gratitude. So many places claim to be the most beautiful place in the world for sunsets, but I love them all. Do you have a favorite  sunset or sunrise place?

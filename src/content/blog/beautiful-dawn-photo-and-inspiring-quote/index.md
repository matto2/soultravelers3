Dawn is the perfect time for a photo, so as the day breaks, I greet the morning and another gorgeous sunrise, each one unique and my favorite part of the day....thus,  I invariably grab my camera.  I so enjoy the stillness and quiet, from [my terrace here in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "rental apartment in Penang, Malaysia"), absorbed in nature with refreshing sea breezes on my cheeks, ready to start a new day.  
  
This one was  full of blue and gold colors as well as a cruise ship and tiny fishing boat passing each other with the sparkling lights from night still a part of the scene, birds chirping and roosters crowing add to the excitement and morning ambience.  
  
"Every morning is a fresh beginning. Every day is the world made new. Today is a new day. Today is my world made new. I have lived all my life up to this moment, to come to this day. This moment--this day--is as good as any moment in all eternity. I shall make of this day--each moment of this day--a heaven on earth. This is my day of opportunity." ~ Dan Custer

Do you like to greet the dawn? When I was younger I use to love to sleep in, but these days I get so much pleasure watching the sun rise.

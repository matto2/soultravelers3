Love experiencing the gorgeous [Louvre Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_du_Louvre "Louvre") in Paris at sunset as the golden light shines upon it and the pyramid designed by American architech  I. M. Pei adds a unique perspective.

Yes, like most [families who visit Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "Families visiting paris"), we have seen the [Louvre Museum inside](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/3-museums-in-a.html "louvre museum inside ") and out during our repeated [touring of Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/paris-bois-de-b.html "Touring of Paris"), but [family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/family-travel-provence-france-narbonne.html "family travel france"), also means just enjoying the ambiance of a place by wandering about.  
  
We were on our way to somewhere else when the sun began to set and led us in this new direction..pulled by the beauty. All of [Paris seems to be happily on a holiday in August,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/free-wifi-travel-office-paris-digital-nomad-technomad-minimalist-workshift-mobile-work-on-the-road.html "Paris summer vacation") with a much more relaxed atmosphere than in the fall.It was wonderful to be re-experiencing a [Paris long stay](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/goodbye-paris.html "Paris long stay") with Mozart now ten as she still had fond [memories of Paris from her vist on her sixth birthday](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "memories of Paris 6th birthday celebrations") here.

There are many wonders inside the amazing Louvre, but experiencing different parts and angles of this former stunning palace while allowing a kid to run and play, is also part of [family travel joy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/madeline-linea.html "family travel joy"). What is your favorite part of the Louvre or family travel?

The Great World Tour  
Mozart loves this fun, educational book! This is another one of our favorites with the theme of learning while having fun because I think that is the best way to learn and it makes it effortless. It has a bit of "where is waldo" feeling too it with lots of good information while hunting. Anyone can take a world tour this way and it is packed with lots of fascinating geography facts and puzzles that make you think.

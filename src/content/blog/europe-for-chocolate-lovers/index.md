Is Europe a mecca for chocoholics? This beautiful chocolate truffle photo was taken in Sitges, Spain, but some of the [best chocolate in the world is in Europe](http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/the-worlds-best-chocolate "best chocolate in the world is in Europe"), so we have indulged in it in MANY places. When it comes to [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel"), there is never a [chocolate shop/chocolatier](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/sun-arc-de-triu.html "chocolate shop chocolatier")  that children ( full grown or pint sized) will not want to stop at and try a piece or two.  
  
  
You can even add some of Europe's best chocolate sights in your vacation or holiday itinerary.  We found the [Lindt](http://www.lindt.com/2865/2866.asp) Chocolate Museum [(Schokolademuseum)](http://www.schokoladenmuseum.de/index_e.html "Schokolademuseum/chocolate museum website") in Koeln/Cologne, Germany delicious, fun and educational! You can learn chocolate's history, watch it being made as well as trying lip-smacking samples.

[Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/chocolate-choco.html "chocolate chocolate chocolate belgium") impressed us in Belgium one of our early stops in [beautiful Brugge](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/brugge-a-living.html "beautiful brugge") on our [family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world tour").It had [more Chocolate](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/more-chocolate.html "more chocolate") than we imagined and it was as beautiful as it was delicious.  
  
We've also had some amazing [hot chocolate in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/notre-dame-left.html "hot chocolate paris"), Madrid ( thick as pudding) , [Venice doing a kid's intinerary](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/kids-lit-itiner.html "venice doing a kid's itinerary") and other places.

Before we left Barcelona,  
we had an amazing authetic  
and typical Catalan meal

Before we left [Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "Barcelona travel"), we had an amazing authetic and typical Catalan meal with our dear [friends who live in Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "friends who live in Barcelona") at the beach. They all speak both Spanish and Catalan and took us to one of their favorite [Catalan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia "Catalan") restaurants in the country side near the cava vineyards as we have been talking about various aspects of [Catalan cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_cuisine "Catalan cuisine") for a while.  
  
I will be writing more details and lots of foodie photos soon, but thought I'd just put this photo up and link to the restaurant for those who might be coming this way soon. The [restaurant is called Ca N'Ayxela](http://www.restaurantcanayxela.net/ "best catalan food in Barcelona") and we had one of the best meals of [our world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "Our world trip")!  
  
We enjoyed some delicous cava in a cave below in the cellar beforehand where they served a variety of renown Catalan sausages ( alas we do not eat pork) and olives. The price was also amazingly cheap for such a meal, service and proportions, plus we lucked out with a decent photo of all three of us.  
  
Have you tried Catalan food? It's very different than typical Spanish cooking so do make sure you try the typical Catalan dishes while in Barcelona.

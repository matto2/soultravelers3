The name Alhambra means “red castle” because in some lights the towers take on a golden reddish hue. It dates back to the ninth century and is a fortress (alcazaba), a palace (alcazar) and a small city (medina). Moorish poets described it accurately as “a pearl set in emeralds” and it is  considered a masterpiece of world architecture.  
  
My favorite part of the Alhambra were the gardens, which like much of the entire complex, were inspired to duplicate heaven on earth. There were awe-inspiring views to the Alhambra, the white Albaicin old moorish section of Granada and the snow capped mountains, plus lots of water elements,greenery and flowers.

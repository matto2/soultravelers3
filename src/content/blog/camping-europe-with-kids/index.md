Truly the BEST and cheapest way to [explore Europe with kids](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/motorhoming-travels-in-europe-.html#more "explore europe with kids take camping vacation") is luxury camping like most of the local families and [retired folks](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retired folks travel") do. Yes, you can have that [ideal European vacation with your kids](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "ideal european vacation with kids") and still stay on your low budget as well as enjoy perks like free kids clubs, pools, saunas, waterparks, movies and connect deeply with European locals. Camping makes finding friends and relaxing in nature so easy, even in a big city. Kids will love the fun and Mom doesn't have to make meals either if she is not in the mood as almost all have good restaurants and stores at the campsite.  
  
We've spent 6 years of [our world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "RTW family world trip"), camping all over Europe with a small campervan RV and easily stayed on our $23/day per person budget even when the euro was high and dollar low.  We love it so much that we will definitely be back for more as soon as we can.  
  
Of course, it helps to do [slow travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel"), but if you have less time, there are always ways to do it like tent camping and choosing lower cost regions or longer stays in rural areas, shorter in expensive cities.  We even know the secrets on how to do it cheaply and [avoid crowds  in high season](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html "avoid crowds in high season travel"). You never have to worry about your child having kids to play with ( usually from several countries) after you tour. Here you see Mozart having a ball with a friend in Europe at our campsite.  
  
Our book on camping Europe has been delayed due to my [travel health challenges](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health challenges") and our recent [focus on Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "focus on Mandarin in Asia"), but we still plan to get it out as soon as we can. What kinds of questions and information do you most want to see in it? After the holidays we are going to put more focus into getting our books complete and out.

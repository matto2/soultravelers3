[Chinese New Year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year "chinese new year") in Asia is a lot of fun and in this Year of the Rabbit, we see rabbits every where! I did not know it was the Year of the Rabbit so I was confused at first and thought perhaps they were celebrating Easter very early in Asia. Ha! As soon as [Christmas in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/first-christmas-in-asia.html "Christmas in asia") was finished, we started seeing rabbits every where we looked to celebrate [Chinese New Year in Asia.](http://www.chinapage.com/newyear.html "chinese new year in asia year of the rabbit")

Chinese New Year in Asia is a time of family reunion so it's very exciting that [we are doing multi-generational family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "multi generational family travel") at this time. My mother is visiting and traveling with us for six weeks and it happens that she was also born in the year of the rabbit in 1928! It's been especially healing because we have [lost two fathers/grandfathers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330148c6782e6f970c "Lost 2 fathers and grandfathers") in the last six months.

This is the  Year of the Rabbit ( or Hare)  according to the Chinese Zodiac calendar and it is celebrated from Bejing to New York City Chinatown, but we find it a much bigger celebration in Chinese dominanted [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang") than we ever experienced in the USA. The whole country of Malaysia takes at least a week off from work or school.  It's the Chinese Spring Festival and part of the Lunar New Year celebrations.(a.k.a. Spring Festival or chun jie  春莭).

The Year of the Rabbit is sandwhiched between more turbulant Tiger and Dragon years, so it is said to be a year to heal, recover, clean, live simply, economically and in a  minimalist way. Sounds perfect for our [family travel globetrotting lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel globestrotting lifestyle")!

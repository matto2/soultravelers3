Yes and in our experience [homeschooling and travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/learning-while-traveling-travel-homeschool-road-school-abroad-5-best-reasons.html "homeschooling and travel") is the [best education for a gifted child](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "homeschool and travel with gifted child").  
  
**USING MUSEUMS FOR SCIENCE**  
  
In this recent photo you see 13 year old Mozart in her lab coat and gloves doing a chromosome experiment by dissecting a fruit-fly larva at the Bio-Lab at the fabulous [Perot Museum of Nature and Science](http://www.perotmuseum.org/ "the perot museum").  
  
Awesome hands-on science for a teen with a wonderful assistant who had a master's degree in Cell Biology. A perfect example how our [taking kids to museums tips](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html "taking kids to museums tips") have been a huge help on our [world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing family world tour") and one way we do science as we roam the world.

**YES, HOMESCHOOL KIDS GO TO TOP COLLEGES**  
  
We are homeschooling middle school and plan to [homeschool high school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool high school"). We are working with Joyce Reed and Gail Lewis from [College Goals](http://www.collegegoals.com/ "college goals") who homeschooled and unschooled their kids that went to MIT, Brown, Carnegie Mellon, Wellesley, and more, so feel supported and encouraged about our choices.  
  
My niece is also a homeschooled child who went on to graduate early and with honors from a top University to become a chemical engineer and quickly got a 6 figure income on her first job!

**HANDS ON LEARNING WITH SCIENTISTS**  
  
We've hunted down hands-on opportunities in many countries like working with [marine biologists in Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/02/only-place-in-europe-to-swim-with-dolphins-portugal.html "swimming with dolphins in Portugal only place in Europe") and Florida with dolphins or archeologists in [Troy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/homers-troy.html "troy travel archeology"), [Ephesus](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/ephesus-stellar.html "ephesus travel with kids") and [ancient ruins around the world.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/best-places-to-visit-ancient-roman-and-greek-ruins.html "best ancient ruins around the world")  
  
Mozart has always been advanced and exceptional in math and science so she has loved many great online courses through Johns Hopkins University's CTY programs and some in person like one where she explored tide pools, collected plankton and  dissected a squid using microscopes at  Marin Headlands.

**SCIENCE EDUCATIONAL FIELD TRIPS**  
  
We search out science educational field trips where ever we go, be it the [Everglades](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/omg-wrestling-alligator-in-the-everglades.html "Everglades alligators"),  [Ria Formosa Natural Park in Portugal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/celebrating-in.html#more "bird migration and nature park portugal"), [elephant seals in Ano Nuevo](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/elephant-seals-at-ano-nuevo-world-school-fieldtrip.html "elephant seals in ano nuevo homeschool") , Kennedy Space center, [trekking in Bhutan ,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/bhutans-bountiful-nature.html "trekking in bhutan") the [Nemo science center in Amsterdam](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/science-center.html "Nemo science center in Amsterdam"), [snorkeling in Hawaii](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/sailing-the-stunning-napali-coast-of-kauai-hawaii-with-dolphins-snorkeling-fun.html "snorkeling in Hawaii") and even an overnight safari at a zoo in Sweden!

**ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION**  
  
Our world travel has definitely impacted Mozart's [environmental education and literacy.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/environmental-education-world-school-kid.html "environmental education and eco literacy")  
  
"Children are born with a sense of wonder and an affinity for Nature. Properly cultivated, these values can mature into ecological literacy, and eventually into sustainable patterns of living. " Barlow

**LAB ASSISTANT IN BOTANY AND ENTOMOLOGY**  
  
We do [organic gardening homeschool](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/travel-organic-garden-homeschool-green-unschool-nature-unit-study-lessons-from-gardening-travel-.html "organic gardening homeschool") even with world travel, enjoy [visiting farms](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/travel-and-paleoprimal-grain-free-gapswapf-healthy-eating.html "visiting farmers for real food sustainable living") around the world and as an 11 year old, Mozart got to be a lab assistant in gardening/botany/entomology/ doing experiments with the amazing Juli Idleman who runs [Dirt to Dinner](http://fromdirttodinner.net/ "dirt to dinner").

**HOMESCHOOL SCIENCE CLASSES**  
  
We do [science homeschool classes](http://www.imagination4kids.com/ "science homeschool san jose") in person when ever we can find great ones, like one in Los Altos where she took apart cameras, phones, remote controls etc and put them back together to learn and she loved that dip into electricity and mechanical engineering.

**UNSCHOOL JUST MEANS FOLLOWING/ENCOURAGING A CHILD'S PASSIONS IN LEARNING**  
  
I actually hate the term "unschool" but all it means to me is following the child's lead and we always try to do that. As her passions and interests change, so does what she studies.  
  
[Our travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html#more "OUR TRAVEL LIFESTYLE") means we spend much [more time in nature](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/beautiful-butterfly-flowers-and-family-travel.html "MORE TIME IN NATURE") than most people, get close up global experiences and we use EVERYTHING as a learning opportunity.

**GREAT FREE ONLINE COURSES IN SCIENCE**  
  
Much learning can be done on the computer for free, so of course we take advantages of things like [**Khan Academy**](http://www.khanacademy.org/) , [**MIT OpenCourseWare,**](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) [**Open Yale Courses**](http://oyc.yale.edu/) , [**Oxford University Mathematics OpenCourseWare**](http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/opencourseware/) and [**TED**](http://www.ted.com/) to name a few.  
  
![homeschool science at science museum in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d79bd21970d.png)  
  
**SCIENCE IN FOREIGN SCHOOLS AND LANGUAGES**  
  
Our brand of [homeschool is very eclectic](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "HOMESCHOOL ECLECTIC ROAD SCHOOL"), using everything to our advantage and included dipping into foreign schools as needed for [language immersion](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "LANGUAGE IMMERSION GLOBAL CITIZEN") during her primary years, so Mozart has gotten some science like [physics in Chinese](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "PHYSICS IN CHINESE") and English, [primary science in Spanish](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "PRIMARY SCHOOL IN SPAIN") and even some UK science curriculum. Always interesting to compare different perspectives on learning and science!  
  
Despite being primarily unschooled, Mozart has always been ahead academically whenever she was in a school environment ( although always being the youngest) or did classes like JHU-CTY with kids from top schools, which was always very reassuring about our homeschool progress.  
  
![homeschool science museum tour Austria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a5116e6e6a970c.png)  
  
**SECRET BEST TIP FOR LEARNING?**  
  
I think the biggest tip for learning is to keep it fun. Not only when they are little, but learning should ALWAYS be an exciting adventure, as that is when we all  learn the most. A work ethic is easy to build if one has enthusiasm and passion for learning.  
  
When Mozart was squealing with delight and jumping for joy at that recent opportunity to do the lab dissection at the Perot Museum, I felt so pleased as a parent that her joy of learning remains so strong. That is a primary educational goal for us, to raise a life long learner who loves every learning opportunity, is passionate, self-directed, caring, committed and has a global perspective.

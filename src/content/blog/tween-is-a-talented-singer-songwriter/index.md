Adele, Pink, Katy Perry are singers/songwiters that [12 year old Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/how-my-almost-teen-became-a-model-.html "teen model") loves, but she too is a prolific songwriter/singer and musician who has been composing songs since she was four...and she writes them in 3 languages..[Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "Fluent Mandarin"), [Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning spanish in spain") and English! Last year she won a trophy at a 1000-kid [Chinese high school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Chinese high school and learning Mandarin") singing competition and was the youngest competitor to become a finalist.  
  
**SINGING, COMPOSING AND ACTING ON TV**  
  
She admires how Selena Gomez sings in two languages and [acts on TV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/how-to-get-on-tv.html "how to get on TV")  ( since [Mozart was in a TV series](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/mozarts-film-de.html "American kid in TV series in Japan")  once with [Japanese star Maako/ 運行](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/japan-star-more.html "Japanese star Maako")) and enjoyed that.   
  
Mozart has always had a passion for composing music and the songs just come to her, but this is the first one we have put online because we are celebrating the birthday of a very dear friend and this is the gift she wanted to give - straight from her heart:  
  

<iframe frameborder="0" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sfE_kZMoewY?rel=0" width="640"></iframe>

  
  
**NO TRAINING OR EXPERIENCE IN SINGING OR SONGWRITING**  
  
Mozart's never had any training in songwriting or singing, so it all comes from within and we are just trying to figure out how to nuture this talent ( which neither parent has) and finding a voice teacher and mentors.  
  
**TALENT AND INTEREST IN MUSIC AND PERFORMING FROM BABYHOOD**  
  
As you know from our [world travels](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "Amazing world travels as a RTW  family ") these last [8 years](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "family travels world for 8 years"), she has been [playing violin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/sahara-violin-c.html "playing violin in sahara desert") since she was 23 months old ( including [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "kid playing video around the world") with a [viral Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4 "viral youtube video")) and [piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ar90wOnWnM "piano lessons by webcam") since she was three...including concerts for both and dancing in the Nutcracker at three as she especially enjoyed performance even then. That said, we are not the type to insist she slave over hours long music practice or any other kind of grueling practice in childhood.  
  
**HOW DOES A CHILD DISCOVER THEIR TALENTS?**  
  
Mozart loves and excels at [advanced math, science](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "child doing physics and advanced math") and [reading](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/10-tips-to-raise-a-reader-book-lover.html "how to raise a reader") in [3 languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "Multilingual reading"), but is also a very [play](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/the-importance-of-play-in-learning.html "importance of play in learning")ful, [creative child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/creative-projec.html "creative child") who [loves art](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/arttravel-kids-jordan.html "kids and art"), making [toys & things](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/kid-friendly-travel-perks.html "making toys and things") and most of all singing, songwriting, acting and public speaking. She has initiated and found most of the opportunities on her own.

**UNCANNY MUSICAL SENSE**  
  
I've written before about how Mozart had an [uncanny musical sense](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html "prodigious musical kid and opera") and desire even as a tiny baby and started asking for opera at a year old...( shocking us)  and likely saw more operas and [Shakespeare plays](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/swimming-with-swans-stratforduponavon-england-uk.html "Shakespeare plays in UK") in toddlerhood than most people see in a lifetime.

**MAKING DECISIONS AND CHOICES IN LIFE & HOW MOZART GOT HER NICKNAME**That standing and clapping to the music as a 5 month old is how she got the nickname Mozart (from the other Moms in the class).  
**ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF MIXING A TRAVEL LIFE AND MUSIC**It might sound fun raising a [gifted child while traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "homeschooling a giftd child through travel"), but the decisions are not always easy and she might have been better supported at times being in just one location for her music_.__

_**1ST KID SINCE WOLFGANG ARMADEUS MOZART TO TRAVEL WORLD  WITH PIANO AND VIOLIN**  
  
That said, there certainly have been advantages to our [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "Our nomadic family travel lifestyle RTW") and she is the first kid since  
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, to [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "travel the world") extensively for a long time with a piano and violin and those experiences certainly enrich creativity too._

_**ADVANTAGES TO SLOW TRAVEL AND WORLDSCHOOLING**  
  
The advantage of [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") and [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world schooling or unschool and travel") is it allows us to take time for things like joining choirs, doing plays, more [public speaking](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/environmental-education-world-school-kid.html "public speaking about the environment") and chances to perform in different languages, but we have also managed to find online violin and piano teachers when we are traveling the world and have a full digital piano in our [RV in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "RV in Europe") and keep a keyboard in Asia.  
  
Traveling is amazing for language learning, adventures and growing up trilingual,  but trickier with music...even a dream lifestyle has pros and cons and endless "workarounds" to keep you on your toes.

**MOZART IS TAKING ADVANCED MUSICAL THEORY CLASSES AT JHU-CTY**  
  
Right now she is loving taking an advanced high school music theory class online through Johns Hopkins University CTY with [Dr. Jolie Lin](http://jolielin.com/about-jolie/ "dr Jolie Lin pianist") ( PhD from the prestigious Peabody Conservatory in piano performance) who has given her glowing reports like:  
  
"Your written assignments have been outstanding thus far. Your notation is always clear  
and easy to read and your work was always completed with a high degree of attention  
and accuracy. You also make it a point to make sure you understand concepts and take  
criticism and feedback very well.  
  
I hope you continue in music as you are very musical" - Jolie Lin

**CAN NON-MUSICIANS RAISE A MUSICIAN?  
**  
Since we are not musicians, it is not always easy to know how best to support her talents and love of music, so like most things, we are playing it by ear. She is currently starring in a middle school play where she has a singing solo at a nearby International school ( even though she is [homeschooled](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "HOMESCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL") now) and adoring that process, the teacher and other kids involved.

**SUPPORTING A PREFORMANCE ARTIST -ACTOR/SINGER/SONGWRITER/MUSICIAN**  
  
I can't even imagine coming up with the lyrics or music for a song, so like most of her creative processes, I delight in being able to be a witness into her magical world. One of the joys of parenting, eh?  
  
We've purposefully avoided the extensive child-performing things up to this point, as we wanted to give her an optimal childhood and foundation, but as she is getting older she really wants to do more. Also, singing/acting is a very early-peak kind of career, especially with females, so most top artists today start in their tweens, teens or earlier and it is funny to see on things like American Idol, 25 is considered "old".  
  
**HOW DO YOU OR WOULD YOU SUPPORT A CHILD'S MUSCIAL OR ARTISTIC TALENTS AND INTEREST?**  
  
  

<iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wn9rDTZj-m4?rel=0" width="640"></iframe>

  
  
**WE'D LOVE YOUR FEEDBACK  
**  
Would you like to see more of Mozart singing/songwriting? Should we do it more professionally, like in a studio next time for better sound quality? Would you be interested in her Spanish and Chinese songs too? Are you interested in covers or just original songs? Mozart has been wanting to learn guitar, but we're not sure if that means we should drop the violin or not.

**IS A TV SHOW OR MOVIE OR SINGING IN OUR FUTURE?**  
  
We are in talks and negotiations at the moment with TV/Film producers/directors/entertainment lawyers etc. behind the scenes, so considering many things and will keep you posted as we know more. We'd love your feedback ( and do take the time to enjoy these videos)!

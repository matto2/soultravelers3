When you visit [UNESCO Heritage](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "UNESCO Georgetown") Site, in Georgetown, [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Penang our rental home"), don't miss colorful Little India that is near Chinatown. Indians are the third dominant culture in [Malaysia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "Malaysia culture") and this ancient quarter is filled with everything Indian from shopping to food.  
  
If you love exotic Indian, Chinese and Malay food, you can't beat [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang") and why it's got the reputation as the best night markets in Asia.  
  
( Our daughter is now off for two weeks, having just finished her Mid-Terms here at her [Mandarin school in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "mandarin school in Penang"), so I am going to try to mostly do just photo posts during this time for the armchair travelers, so that we can have more family time. I know many of you are also busy with back to school preparations, so hopefully this will beÂ  good for all. )

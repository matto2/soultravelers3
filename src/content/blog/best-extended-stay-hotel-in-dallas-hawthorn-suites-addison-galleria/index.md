**TRIP ADVISOR CERTIFICATE OF EXCELLENCE AWARD**  
  
We looked at TONS of long-stay hotels, short-term rental apartments, temporary housing and vacation homes in Dallas and there is a reason why this [Hawthorn Suites](http://www.hawthorn.com/ " Hawthorn Suites") gets glowing reviews and were the recipient of 2013 TripAdvisor Cerificate of Excellence Award. Friendly, excellent service from the general manager to the maids and superb amenities that dazzle.

You will love their clean, spacious, contemporary apartment-style suites with fully equipped kitchen and full sized fridge, comfy living rooms, stylish bathrooms and the most luxuriously, comfortable beds we have ever slept in! It is more like an apartment complex with the services of a hotel - best of both worlds.  
  
This quote from a happy customer from TripAdvisor says it all:  
  
"They always take care of my needs, and they always treat me like family! I have stayed at this hotel many times, and the first time was as good as the last! I highly recommend this hotel! I won't stay anywhere else when I come to this city!"

**FOOD AND DRINKS**  
  
We are totally spoiled here, almost everything you might need is provided.  
  
**OMG!  FREE BREAKFAST**  
  
There is an amazing complementary, well-balanced hot buffet breakfast (  sausage, bacon, eggs, potatoes, gravy, bagel, whole wheat toast, pastries, coffee, juice, tea, chocolate milk, hot cocoa, yogurt, oatmeal, cold cereals.fresh fruit etc. and even easy make-yourself wafffles in the shape of Texas that delights kids and adults alike) served in a relaxing room with a view of the pool.

**KITCHEN AND BBQ**  
  
With a fully equipped kitchen in each spacious suite and an outdoor grill by the pool one also  has the option to make your own special meals, anytime, which works really well for us and our strict dietary needs. ( We can walk to Whole Foods).

**COMPLEMENTARY DINNER SNACKS, WINE, BEER**  
  
Don't feel like cooking? They have a free evening Reception Monday through Thursday which includes wine, beer and dinner snacks like hot dogs, salads, soups and tacos to munch and mingle with other residents. ( Not to mention the endless restaurants in the area including one across the street.)

 The kitchen is very well equipped which is great for a cook like me to take advantage of the full size refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, lots of utensils/silverware/crockery, dish soap, linens, toaster, garbarge disposal etc., plus no worries with housekeeping or taking out the garbage.  
  
 **"HOME" NOT A "HOTEL"**  
  
  
![best extended stay hotel Dallas Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Addison Galleria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcc77b95970b.png)  
  
  
It is a "home" not a "hotel" as we like to choose places that we WANT to live. [Life on the road](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "life on the road of a traveling family") needs to be about pleasure, coziness, luxury, healing, and ease, with all the comforts of home...more about LIFE than the road, to give us a place to replenish, stick to routines, "cocoon" in, as we explore the new.  
  
  
![best extended stay hotel Dallas Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Addison Galleria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcc77ba0970b.png)  
  
**WE ARE EXPERTS ON EXTENDED STAY TRAVEL**  
  
As an [8-plus-year](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "kid traveling world 8 years")\-non-stop [world traveling family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "round the world traveling family"), we are probably the  "poster child" for extended stay or affordable long-stay acommodations and have done it extensively around the world from [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "how to winter in southeast Asia cheaply") to [Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "winter in spain"), but we found it quite challenging to find what we needed in Dallas.  
  
  
![best extended stay hotel Dallas Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Addison Galleria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcc77ba7970b.png)  
  
**HUNTING DOWN A DALLAS LONG STAY ACCOMMODATION**  
  
We haven't seen the other [Hawthorn Suites](http://www.hawthorn.com/hotels/destinations "Hawthorn Suites locations") in Dall as, but we did see all the other extended stay competitors in this area, and this one wins hands down. One well known brand that was recommended was absolutely scary inside, so we were discouraged at first about trying to find our "Dallas Home".  
  
  
![happy in our new home, but squinting in the sun](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d829d73970d.png)  
  
**BEST SERVICE**  
  
After [arriving in Dallas at the Four Seasons](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/dallas-luxury-resort-arriving-to-big-d-in-style.html "arrival to dallas four seasons"), we knew we needed to find the perfect place to base here and from the very first call from there to this place, (answered by a  kind, patient and helpful voice on the other end), I had a good feeling about it and that just grew as we arrived and settled in. I called them because I liked the reviews I read on Tripadvisor.

**A SPECIAL PLACE**  
  
 With a child in tow, we have to make sure we are in a safe, clean, quiet, wholesome place for a long stay. We fell in love with this Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Addison Galleria before we approached them about sponsoring our stay.  
  
We are experienced business people, boomers and traveling family with discriminating taste and this is precisely the kind of place that appeals to and satisfies us.

**BEAUTIFUL SUNSET FROM OUR ROOM**  
  
This is the sunset out our window and it gives me much pleasure to be bathed in these colors as I prepare dinner for my family. I seem to have an unconscious knack for finding places around the world with divine [sunrises](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/sunrise-sunset.html "sunrise photo and quote") and [sunsets](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/sweet-sunset.html "sunsets and inspiration")

**DELIGHTFUL SURROUNDINGS**  
  
The indoor and outdoor public spaces like the dining room and lobby are relaxing with coffee, tea,  snacks and wifi always available, free daily newspapter and a 24/7 Business Center with complimentary computer, internet access and printing.

**ADDISON AND DALLAS DESTINATIONS**  
  
Addison is just North of Dallas and very central to shopping, restaurants, and other entertainment. It is  close to the Addison Conference Center, DFW Airport, Dallas Museum of Art and Dallas World Aquarium.  
  
You can catch a Dallas Cowboys football game or watch the Texas Rangers. Visit the Arboretum, Six Flags, Cavanaugh Flight Museum, or the Sixth Floor Museum to name a few.  
  
Addison is one of the best places in the USA to see [fireworks on July 4th.](http://www.addisontexas.net/events/kaboomtown/ "July 4th fireworks addison texas")  
  
  
![best extended stay hotel Dallas Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Addison Galleria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcc77c11970b.png "best extended stay hotel Dallas Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Addison Galleria")  
  
**CONVENIENCE**  
  
 It is very easily accessed from the Dallas North Tollway and I635 - the two major highways. It is near DART and the Addison Bus Transit Center, making all Dallas venues easily reachable like the Dallas Opera, Symphany or see a musical like we are tonight at the Music Hall at Fair Park.  
  
![Galleria Shopping Center Dallas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d829ded970d.png "Galleria Shopping Center Dallas")  
  
Dallas has more shops and restaurants per capita than New York City. Don't miss world-class shopping (and ice skating) at the upscale Dallas Galleria Mall that is about 4 minutes away. One of teen fashionista  Mozart's new favorite places.  
  
On the other end of the spectrum Walmart is right around the corner. There are a huge selection of restaurants that surround the hotel, many within close walking distance.

But if you are still hungry they have a gigantic supply of snacks and drinks on hand.

It was a rare treat for us to watch the Super Bowl on a HDTV Flat screen TV and we enjoy watching movies on  the DVD player on weekends as well as free local calls plus great heating and A/C in our room.  
  
To top it off they have a free shuttle to local destinations in a 3 mile radius.

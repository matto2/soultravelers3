For our [globetrotting](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "globetrotting") [nomad tween](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/nomadic-lifestyle-with-children-.html "nomad children, teen and tweens travel"), it is a way of life to [celebrate birthdays around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "celebrating birthdays around the world") in [multilanguages](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "multilingual how to"). She is long use to hearing the birthday song in Mandarin, [Spanish](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/last-day-of-sch.html "spanish school") and English ( plus other languages).  
  
We like to keep a record of her unique birthdays for her, as well using the blog as a way to share with family, friends and readers who have watched her grow.  
  
First starting at 5 with her [good bye pajama party](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/suite-bon-voyag.html "good bye pajama party") in California, then she celebrated her 6th [birthday in Paris,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "birthday in Paris")  7th [birthday in Salazburg](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/10/super-7-salzbur.html "birthday in salzburg"), ( and [Dalmation coast](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/dalmatia-coast.html "dalmation coast"))  her [8th birthday in Stockholm](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html "8th birthday in stockholm"), her 9th [birthday in London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html "birthday in london"), her 10th [birthday in Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "birthday in barcelona") and her 11th birthday at [Harry Potter's Wizarding World](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-kids-review.html "harry potter's wizarding world review")  [](http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/ "harry potter's wizarding world")at [Universal in Orlando Florida](http://www.universalorlando.com/home/home.aspx "Universal orlando").  
  
This fall, she is in her [Mandarin school in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin school in Asia"), so was thrilled to plan a big 12 party with her dear Chinese friends here. She had some amazing parties at [our home in California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "home in California") for one through five birthdays, but often in [fulltime  travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "full time travel how-to"), one can't have a [big party with friends](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "big party with friends"), so she was in her element these last few months planning this extravaganza. This is her 3rd continent and  8th country to celebrate a birthday ( we sometimes have two that I didn't list), and first birthday celebration for her in Asia.  
  
**FAMILY CELEBRATION FIRST**  
  
  
![birthday balloons and surprise](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3cb21373970c.jpg)  
  
Who wouldn't want to skip school and wake up to balloons covering her bed, birthday greeting on her window and a surprise package waiting? She discovered the series "Friends" in [London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/top-budget-hotel-london-travelodge-waterloo-review-central-london-lodging-bargain-family-friendly.html "London travel ") in 2011, so was  happy to discover a boxed set here that she has been coveting for weekend viewing, thus a surprise that delighted her that started the day right... Squeals of joy, hand made card and decorations.  
  
![healthy bubble gum and mall rat shopping](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3cb21497970c.jpg)  
  
What tween girl wouldn't want a shopping spree at the mall, especially when she had it mostly to herself since everyone else was in school or at work?  
  
![happy kid](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3cb215d8970c.jpg)  
  
She had to put on the new T-shirt she bought plus the new bangles and love earrings from her shopping spree...while still at the mall.   She was one happy kid and the whole family really enjoyed this week day of indulgence on her birthday that fell in the middle of the week.  We also saw a great movie at the mall and like rock stars, we had the whole luxury theater to ourselves and brought our own [healthy popcorn](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/how-to-make-healthy-popcorn.html "healthy popcorn"). We had some Chinese food at a fave restaurant ( something I don't usually do with my [health issues](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "travel health")) and then cuddled and watched a new DVD movie at home.  
  
**WEEKEND KARAOKE BIRTHDAY PARTY WITH FRIENDS**

Singing the birthday song, making a wish and blowing out those candles!

Lots of good food and drinks! Nom, nom.

Birthday love earrings and singing a favorite  Mandarin pop song.

The party room was jumping with happy girls!  
  
![delicious birthday cake and presents](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c32838c7a970b.jpg)  
  
Yummy birthday cake that she picked out and ordered  from a favorite bakery in the mall. We haven't been eating any sugar for about a year, ( only raw honey) so this was a big splurge.  
  
![food and more food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee42767e8970d.jpg)  
  
Dinner was part of the package for our Karaoke party, so the tweens had more than enough to eat.

Not just karaoke, but wii games too kept the girls occupied. ( Something we've never invested in but she has played it at other friends houses in several countries).  
  
![balloon dance and Mandarin Pop](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee4276b29970d.jpg)  
  
You can't have too many balloons for a party.

**SLEEP OVER WITH BFF IN ASIA** - **THE CELEBRATION CONTINUES**

Even after the party, the birthday celebrations continued as the custom here is to open presents away from guests. She had invited her best friend over for a sleepover so they opened the presents at our home in Penang.

An amazing birthday celebration for this happy 12 year old!!

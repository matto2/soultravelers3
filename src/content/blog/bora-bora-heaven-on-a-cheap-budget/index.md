[Bora Bora](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "Bora Bora on cheap budget"), an island in the mesmerizing archipelago of [Tahiti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-french-polynesia-cheaply.html "Tahiti cheap budget vacation") in the South Pacific, is one of the most beautiful and remote locations in the world. I dreamt about visiting and vacationing in Bora Bora for many years, but it is known for it's highest-priced luxury hotels as much as its beauty and we are family travelers who travel the world on a tiny budget of $23/day per person.  
  
We were so very pleased to discover that Bora Bora and all of Tahitian [French Polynesia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/moorea-cheap-and-amazing.html "French Polynesia cheaply") can be a very family friendly cheap destination without losing any of the world-class luxury and one can actually experience it more authentically outside of the cruise ship or luxury hotel route.  
  
How? We kept to our low budget by [couch surfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org/ "CouchSurfing") with an amazing veterinarian and eating like locals ( mainly buying from grocery stores the local, not imported food, like delicious French bread and Tahitian mango jam for breakfast). We also checked out local long stay places and cheap but charming funky hotels on the beach for  a possible long stay in the future and found there are many great low budget options for those willing to look.  
  
You can also visit and hang out at the top luxury hotels without paying the high prices...except maybe a drink ( which even that will be a major splurge as tourist prices are wild). There was hardly anyone at the hotels when we visited, so we pretty much had all the luxury to ourselves.  
  
The beautiful beach where the locals hang out  is always free and we did a wonderful small boat all-day excursion tour where we swam with sharks and visited this family-owned motu ( small islands surrounding the gorgeous blue lagoon), sang polynesian songs and fed these turtles. We had a ball on other days just exploring the island, hanging out with locals and absorbing the unique culture.  
  
Don't eliminate Bora Bora or Tahiti as a destination, just because you are a budget traveler. In my opinion, going budget to Bora Bora is by far the best way to experience it! Happy too that I finally got this favorite photo on our blog. So many happy memories.  
  
Have you been to Bora Bora yet or is it on your bucket list?

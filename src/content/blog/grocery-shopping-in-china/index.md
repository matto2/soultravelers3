One of the best things about [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel around the world"), is just doing ordinary things in extraordinary places. Who would guess that just grocery shopping [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/around-the-world-family-travel/ "around the world") is part of a [good travel education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "education and family travel")?  
  
In basic ways, unlike the shopping [markets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/bhutan-food-markets.html "Bhutan food markets"), [grocery stores](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/food-myths-real.html "grocery shopping Spain") are [not so different](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/where-to-buy-organic-food-in-penang.html "organic food penang") around the world, but dealing with cultural and language challenges usually comes up and often [very different kinds of food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/food-shopping-san-sebastian-spain-unusual-markets-europe.html "very different kinds of food") as well. For a family into [organic food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic food") and [health choices](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "healthy food  and travel"), reading labels and deciding what to buy can be a challenge and adventure.  
  
We had an [apartment rental](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/terracotta-army.html "apartment rental Xi'an") from [Wimdu](http://www.wimdu.com.my/ "wimdu rental apartments world wide") when we were [in Xian](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-travel-shopping-and-markets-rtw.html "Xi'an China ") that I will be writing about soon, thus that meant going to a grocery store so we could cook some of our own food. Truthfully, I have some fears about [food in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/food-in-china.html "food in China"), but then I do about food in the USA and every where. We made simple choices like free range eggs and veggies and hoped for the best and it seemed to work for us.  
  
Local Bruce Zhang, our great [travel guide in Xi'an](http://www.chinatravel20.com/2012/06/04/my-xian-partner-is-ready-for-your-china-travel-2-0-tours/ "best travel guide in Xi'an China"), was kind enough to help us with our shopping because even with our daughter being [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "fluent in Mandarin"), it was great to have the help. DaVinci did grocery shop some on his own in Beijing, including at a Carrefour store ( that are popular hypermarkets [in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Europe vacation best "), especially [France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/europe-road-trip-a-drive-through-france-provence-to-dordogne-via-photos-family-travel.html "france travel and road trip tips") that we know from there but are very different in China). It was always easier when he took Mozart, but if he was alone, he kept asking until he found an English speaker to help.  
  
Notice all the Christmas decorations? That surprised me all over China as most don't really celebrate Christmas there, but it IS common in [most of Asia to see Christmas decorations](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/24/seven-fascinating-facts-about-christmas-in-china/ "christmas decorations in China") and we even see it here [in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/tropical-christmas-abroad-in-asia.html "Christmas in Penang") which is a Muslim country. ( There are Christians of course and other religions here as it is a multicultural country, but Christians are an extremely tiny minority here, so the holiday is not celebrated by many).  
  
One thing that surprised us was the loud speaker bargains going on in Beijing which seemed to just add to the sensory overload and crowds. Also because we were the only Caucasians in the store, we...especially Mozart with her long blond hair.....got a lot of attention. She was even "stalked" by some young girls her age, for a bit, who ( after they all got over their shyness) seemed pleasantly surprised to find out she could [speak Mandarin fluently](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Speak Mandarin Fluently").

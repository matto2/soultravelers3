Not like the [snow storms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_storm "Winter storm") on the  
East Coast or Snowmageddon 2015,  
but half an inch of snow closed down

Not like the snow storms on the East Coast or Snowmageddon 2015, but half an inch of snow closed down [Dallas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/omg-snow-in-dallas.html "snow dallas") and![Snow and Ice Closes Dallas Down!

brought a little bit excitement to all. [Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2015/02/teen-mozart-singing-red-carpet-grammys.html "teen mozart singing grammy red carpet") had to rush out

and make some snowballs. I grew up in Michigan and lived in NYC, so I've seen my share of snowstorms, but

NEVER saw such a little bit close down everything. Schools are closed, offices are closed.

I guess everyone is out making snowmen!

Or cleaning off the snow on their cars.

Dallas has no snow machines to clear the roads since snow is a rarity here. I've read they don't use salt because the cars here are not protected from it. Roads are a hazard now.

So a little bit of snow, topped with sleet and cold temps brings everything to a halt in a place where we were just wearing shorts about a week ago! It will melt soon. Who is ready for Spring?

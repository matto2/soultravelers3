As we [road trip around Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/10/road-trip-croatia-montenegro.html#more) this [fall](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/10/stunning-fall-colors-around-the-world.html) as [digital nomad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/08/-europes-cheapest-digital-nomad-haven-bansko.html#more) [world travelers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/03/retirement-traveling-around-the-world.html) & do [house hunting in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/07/americans-house-hunting-in-spain-home-buying-abroad-.html#more) virtually, I  noticed the [controversy around Hilary Swank](https://www.eonline.com/news/1349275/emmy-rossum-fiercely-defends-hilary-swank-from-criticism-over-her-pregnancy) announcing her [pregnancy at 48](https://sports.yahoo.com/emmy-rossum-defends-hilary-swank-151641176.html) & was surprised there was a lot of hate & misinformation from people who do not know better. I have experience in this area that was super positive ( although I did not have twins). Becoming a mother varies significantly by geography and education. Now first-time mothers are older in big cities and on the coasts, and younger in rural areas and in the Great Plains and the South. Thus, very different perspectives. ALL my peer friends had babies in their 40's, loved it and now have wonderful grown children and [full lives o](http://soultravelers3new.local/2024/02/watch-heavenly-reyna-in-film-the-greatest-ever-trailer-hotel-cafe-.html)f their own. And the number of babies born to women 45 and older  has more than tripled over the past decade!

22 years ago, I [had a child at 48](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html) and it was the most wonderful, easy pregnancy with zero complications  & [amazing childhood](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html) ( we raised [our trilingual kiddo around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/09/happy-birthday-heavenly-labor-day-birthing-day-life.html#more) for a decade [choosing worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/curriculum-vitae-for-a-gifted-child-world-schooling.html) & [van life pioneering](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html)). I am 70 & we are both super healthy and feel like 20 & she is [already very successful](http://soultravelers3new.local/2021/11/heavenly-reyna-releases-winter-wishes-trilingual-ep.html). We had so much more time, money, experience, wisdom, support to give her that we never would have had at 20. Best choice evah, so [big congrats to Hilary](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjVgDlpt1ez/?hl=en)!! They will do great! Older mom's tend to live longer & my mom is 95 & I grew up with 4 great grandparents, ( mom & grandmother both had late babies)  so we are [traveling the world enjoying ourselves](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/09/vacation-vs-full-time-travel-digital-nomad-lifestyle.html#more) & likely will for a long time.

This photo was taken yesterday after a long hike, boat ride and up many, many stairs in Croatia where we had a blast exploring. Do we look decrepit?  I feel like 20 now and exercise vigorously daily. MANY women now have babies in their 40's & I think it is better for mom & child to have a wiser, more mature, more financially stable mom who spent her young years focused on career, saving, learning about life and cherish their child/children in a way that is not possible at 20 because of life experience.

My mom was a young & vibrant 71 when my daughter was born ( above photo is a recent one this year & she is 95)  & was a very involved grandmother ( between her daily golfing & walking). Many women today eat well and take good care of their health. I would have made a horrible mother at 20 and been unhappy as career was important to me then ( and saving for the future), but when I was ready & started trying around 40 ( many miscarriages), I was a great mom. So timing is everything and up to the individual to make a choice that works best for them and their circumstances. There is no one perfect choice for anyone & every choice has pros and cons. We felt young when we had her and we feel young now & did through the whole process! Most parents in the areas we lived were a similar age to us, so that was never an issue.

[Emmy Rossum defended Hilary Swank's pregnancy at 48 with "go f-k yourself"](Emmy%20Rossum defends Hilary Swank’s pregnancy at age 48: ‘Go f–k yourself’), but I think there are better ways to enlighten people and show there are MANY great reasons to have a late baby and it is a trend in highly educated areas. Celebrating and supporting a new mother is always a good thing and even more so when the mother has had a struggle to get the child. I love the trend of older parenting and think it will continue and benefit our world. The [many studies](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/5-advantages-being-older-parent-ncna775581) on having and raising a child as [older mom](https://www.babygaga.com/15-benefits-of-being-an-older-mom-that-you-didnt-think-of/) and parents show the benefits!

[Travel with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/paris-travel-with-kids.html "travel with kids") means what best toys to bring with you. How to choose toys for travel? What kind of travel and how long? The decision can be easier than you think.  
  
Boys and girls, big and small, from all over the world, are attracted to our "kid magnet". They light up and usually stop by and want to join in the fun when they spot our daughter's creations that she makes out of [Legos and Playmobiles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/heavenly-holida.html "legos and playmobile").

  
These have been the biggest toy hits on our [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family world trip") and we have used them constantly between the ages of 5 and 11 during our travels. Snap Circuit, pollypockets,  ball, bike, tennis racket and various games like Monopoly, Uno and Match have also been the mainstays. We use flat fish tackle boxes as organizers for the small things and a big baggie for the legos.

Even when we [pack very light](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "pack very light") with just a carry-on piece of luggage each, she carries a little sandwhich bag full  of favorite legos and playmobiles, an inflatable globe that can also be used as a ball, and a deck of cards. Of course, we always have [art supplies when traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/kids-art-creativity-travel-family-friendly-travel-education-homeschool-roadschool-.html "art supplies") even in our day back.  
  
She can entertain herself for hours lost in [imaginative play](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-play-date.html "imaginative play") and [creating things](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/creative-projec.html "creating things") with these open ended toys. It's fun to hear her doing this play in Spanish as she is doing with this 12 year old friend from [Bilbao](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/wow-guggenheim-bilbao-.html "Bilbao") at our [campsite in Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "campsite in barcelona"). Often times she has a whole [slew of kids playing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/workyoutube-pla.html "whole slew of kids playing") there from three to 15 and speaking many different languages at once.  
  
What is your favorite travel toy?

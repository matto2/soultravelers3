Learning to Surf in Kauai

There is not a better place in  
the world to learn to surf than  
the warm clear waters of Kauai

There is not a better place in the world to learn to surf than the warm clear waters of Hanalei Bay on the North Shore of Kauai. We all had a blast thanks to [Hawaiian Surfing Adventures](http://www.hawaiiansurfingadventures.com/ "Hawaiian Surfing adventures") and our 10 year old got up on her first try. To top it off it is gorgeous, with the cliffs in the background supposedly forming a dragon, just like in the  famous song  "Puff the Magic Dragon" who "frolicked in an autumn mist in a land called Hanalei"

If you love aloha spirt of old Hawaii, then Kauai is for you and it is filled with charm, beauty and friendly people. Our California born daughter has always [dreamed of a family vacation in Hawaii , and Kauai](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html "dream of a family vacation in Hawaii and Kauai") made all those dreams come true, including learning to surf and becoming a true surfer girl!

Hawaiian Surfing Adventures was started by a native Hawaiian surfer, they use friendly and helpful competitive surfers as teachers and it has a unique method that starts on land first. We felt at home almost immediately upon arrival, drinking in the beauty of the place and the people. Everybody in the family got to surf, even me with my handicap of gimpy leg and arm and middle aged, overweight body.  It was a thrill for each and everyone of us!

Both DaVinci and I had surfed before, but it was good to get some time on land to remind us as it has been many decades since we were last on a surf board and it was Mozart's first time, despite being a Santa Cruz native who had an O'Neil wetsuit before she was a year old and began to swim at 4 days old.

We hit the beach and Mozart took to surfing like a duck to water. She made it look effortless and did not want to stop.

Even Mom and Dad enjoyed the surfing in this idyllic spot! Interestingly DaVinci had learned to surf in Hawaii when he was 15 and his sister lived there. He has also done a lot of surfing in Santa Cruz over the years, but wanted Mozart to learn in the warm waters of Hawaii, so passed up the chance when we were in [Santa Cruz recently with a private surfing beach](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/homeaway-santa-cruz-beach-house-vacation-rental-review-best-family-friendly-lodging.html "santa cruz vacation rental with private beach") at our disposal.

Due to my mobility challenges and my funky arm due to my [bike riding accident and surgery in Austria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "bike riding accident and surgery in Austria"), I couldn't stand and surf, but I DID enjoy riding the waves prone style, a LOT.

We really enjoyed meeting the owner's pretty daughter who also loves to travel, his sweet wife and our enthusiastic surfing  teacher who is a native Hawaiian who has surfed this area is whole life. Mozart tried her first [star fruit fresh off a tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carambola "star fruit") there and we treated her to some yummy famous [Hawaiian shave ice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shave_ice "Hawaiian shave ice") when we returned after surfing. ( it's just around the corner from the waves).

Our trip to Hawaii was sponsored by [Hawaii Visitors and Conventions Bureau.](http://www.hvcb.org/ "Hawaiian visitors and conventions bureau") Our opinions, stories, photos and experiences are our own. We do really appreciate kind hearted [Nathan Kam](http://twitter.com/nathankam "nathan Kam") ( who we know from [Twitter](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3 "twitter")) and the whole amazing  professional  crew there who helped us make this dream of Mozart's come true!

Have you ever surfed or been to beautiful Kauai?

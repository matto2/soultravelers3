Who doesn't love a delicious, fast, easy, healthy dessert? This scrumptious apple pie recipe is paleo, gluten-free, grain-free, including a raw pie crust and with a minor tweak works for vegans too.  
  
**QUICK, HEALTHY AND DELISH**  
  
With a [teen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "Mozart talented teen singer, songwriter, musician") in the house, I am becoming an expert in this area of fast, creative, healthy recipes even on our [non-stop #RTW trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "around-the-world family travel") , as a [minimalist family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family") with unique challenges like not having an oven, only 3 pans, 2 burners and no pie pan at the moment in our [extended-stay hotel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/best-extended-stay-hotel-in-dallas-hawthorn-suites-addison-galleria.html "best extended stay hotel in dallas - Hawthorn Suites Addison"). ( We have a micro-wave, but don't use it).

**EASY HEALTHY RECIPES**  
  
Like all my super [healthy dessert recipes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/best-healthy-chocolate-ice-cream-recipe-no-machine.html "healthy fast chocolate ice cream recipe paleo no machine"), I like to keep things easy and simple ( ie [chocolate cake](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/10/best-chocolate-cake-recipe-ever-and-its-paleo-healthy-grain-free.html "best paleo chocolate cake recipe"), [banana bread](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/healthy-banana-bread-recipe-paleogapsgluten-free.html "banana bread healthy recipe paleo GAPS grain-free"), [clafouti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/yum-super-healthy-dessert-recipe-paleo-mango-clafouti.html "healthy clafouti paleo dessert"), [chocolate covered strawberries](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/how-to-recipe-for-chocolate-strawberries-paleo-vegetarian.html "chocolate covered strawberry recipe paleo and vegan"), [ice cream with out machine](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/easy-healthy-homemade-ice-cream-no-machine-.html#more "healthy ice cream no machine") etc.)

**HEALTHY TREATS**  
  
Since we have been not eating ANY grains, legumes, processed food or sugar, with our organic veggie - based WAPF/GAPS and autoimmune-paleo (AIP) friendly style diet on our [prevent and cure cavities and crooked teeth](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "prevent and cure cavities naturally") health kick, I am always looking for healthy, easy treats for us.  
  
Mozart and her dad have a sweet tooth and are crazy about apple desserts so I make this for them mostly and they love it. They are both very fussy and very particular eaters, so you know it must be good.

**FAST RAW PIE CRUST IN 30 SECONDS**!  
  
I love that I can make it as a fast and spontaneous idea, since it takes few ingredients and can be ready in a few minutes as an answer to Mozart's endless question, "what can I eat now?" and she or her father can make it on thier own as well.  
  
**WHERE TO BEGIN**  
  
Chop the apples and simmer in a fry pan on the stove in some organic coconut oil and cinnamon while you make the raw pie crust.  
  
![Best raw pie crust!! Easy, Fast, No Bake  Pie Recipe:](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a5119ad9d4970c.png)  
  
**NO ROLLING PIN NEEDED AND NO-BAKE**  
  
Use your fingers to fill the pie pan or in my case, just a shallow bowl as it works fine too and won't go in an oven. You can use a fork to make that pie-look around the edges, but not really needed.

**CHILL TO SET**  
  
Put the bowl in the freeze for a few moments as that is how you "bake" this pie. When the apples are soft and sweet, put them in the pie crust. Really you can stop there, but if you want to get fancier add a top.  
  
**NO SUGAR**  
  
I added chopped, fresh stevia to this batch of apples, but it is not really necessary and I likely will not do it again. You can add honey or maple syrup to the apples mix, but we find it unnecessary and healthier to avoid extra fructose.

**TOP OR NOT**  
  
For this pie I happened to add the top ( depends on my mood). Just "roll out" some of the dough with your fingers to make a topper to the pie on some parchment paper, then put that in the freezer for a few moments to "bake" ( actually harden).  
  
**VEGAN TIPS ANE TWEAK**  
  
Vegans can just omit the raw honey ( if they don't eat it) and replace with pure Maple Syrup and replace the grass fed butter with all coconut oil.  
  
![Easy, Fast, No Bake Apple Pie Recipe:gluten free , grain free, paleo, vegan, healthy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fceb31ae970b.png)  
  
**TASTE AND** **TEXTURE**  
  
The only bad news about this pie is it crumbles easily, so doesn't hold it's shape once cut into, but it TASTES  heavenly, so that doesn't bother us. I love it that all the ingredients can be raw except the apples, so that boosts it's [nutritional value](http://www.kitchenstewardship.com/2011/06/28/a-sweet-sweet-summer-does-raw-honey-have-health-benefits/ "raw honey nutritional value").  
  
**PIE A LA MODE**  
  
We sometimes top it and make a "pie a la mode" style with either Greek Yogurt made with [raw milk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/raw-milk-fast-and-cure.html "raw milk") or [homemade ice cream](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/best-healthy-chocolate-ice-cream-recipe-no-machine.html "home made ice cream recipe without a machine"). I make a homemade French Vanilla ice cream without a machine, just omitting the raw cacao and using organic vanilla instead. In Asia I used [coconut](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconut milk health benefits") milk, but here I mostly use raw milk because it is easier and cheaper here ( and not processed at all or in a can). The taste is similar, so it is a matter of preference.

**RECIPE FOR PALEO APPLE PIE**  
  

Ingredients  
  
**30-Second  Pie Crust**  
  
**\*** 1/2 cup melted grass-fed butter  
  
**\*** 1/4 cup cold-pressed organic coconut oil, melted  
  
**\*** 1 cup coconut flour  
  
**\*** 2 - 3 tablespoon raw honey ( or maple syrup)  
  
**\*** 1/4 - 1 teaspoon organic Vanilla extract  
  
**\***  1/4 - 1 teaspoon organic cinnamon powder  
  
**\*** A pinch of Himalayan or Celtic Sea salt to taste

_  
Instructions:  
  
_Put butter into a pan and melt slowly while you blend dry ingredients in separate bowl of coconut flour, cinnamon and Celtic sea salt.  
  
Add vanilla, butter and coconut oil slowly while mixing well. Coconut flour varies and absorbs moisture, so you can play a bit with the liguid ( adding more or less) to get the right consistency to make a dough ball.  
  
Fool proof! I find it stil works and is very forgiving even if it is very moist or very dry. You be the judge on what you like best and you will learn to tweak this recipe to your liking.  
  
Add the raw, unheated honey last to make sure the dough is cool enough to take advantage of the healing enzymes in the raw honey. ( Cool the apple filling before putting on crust for same reason).  
  
Press mixture evenly onto the bottom and sides of a pie plate or even just a shallow bowl as I do here. Feel free to pleat your dough edge with a fork for a traditional look if you want.  
  
Put the crust in pan in the freezer for a few minutes to allow the butter and coconut oil to harden or "bake" and voilà it is done!  
  
You can also use any excess dough to make a lattice top or make additional dough for a top crust as I did here.  
  
I just put the extra dough on a piece of parchment and make a round flat crust...adding a heart or slicing into strips for the lattice top. Again, pop into the freezer for a few moments and chill to set.  
  
Put the apples in the pie crust pan and leave alone or cover, depending on your mood and time. Keep pie refrigerated.  
  
**Apple  Pie Filling  
**  
Ingredients:  
  
**\*** 2-5 organic apples  
  
**\*** 1 tablespoon cold pressed organic coconut oil  
  
**\*** 1 teaspoon organic cinnamon powder  
  
  
  
_Instructions:_  
  
Chop up the apples and simmer them slowly in the coconut oil before you do anything else. I leave the peel because it is healthier and easier,  but suit yourself.  
  
Let it simmer slowly while you work on the crust and add the cinnamon to taste towards the end. Cook until soft and sweet.  
  
Some people add honey or a sweetener to this, but we don't think it needs it and we try to keep our fructose levels low for health.   
  
I did add fresh, chopped stevia to this batch, because I am growing it on my window sill, so thought I'd experiment, but it wasn't neccessary and I won't next time.

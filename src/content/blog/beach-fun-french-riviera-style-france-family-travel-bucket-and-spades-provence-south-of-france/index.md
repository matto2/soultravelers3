We're not into slathering with oil, just laying around and tanning, so  prefer uncrowded beaches and our 9 year old Mozart had so much fun at this private beach that was part of our campsite near [Colliore](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html) called [Les Criques de Porteils](http://www.lescriques.com/).

There are plenty of sandy beaches in this area, but she liked this one because she could snorkel, had more privacy for that [Swiss Family Robinson](http://www.amazon.com/Swiss-Family-Robinson-Unabridged-Classics/dp/1402726023/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1283204257&sr=1-2) or [Swallows and Amazons](http://www.amazon.com/Swallows-Amazons-Godine-Storyteller-Ransome/dp/1567924204/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1283204335&sr=1-1) adventurous atmosphere and she adored catching little crabs in their shells. We'd go late in the day to avoid the sun and wait until most people left the beach.

She easily caught over one hundred crabs one day and glowed with excitement as she showed them to me in her bucket. She also collected rocks and shells and met a few friends there although none spoke the same language. Most were French here but she also met a little Dutch girl about her age.

A good healthy learning time with that tween sense of endless summer adventure made famous like the books above or in series like [The Box Car Children](http://www.amazon.com/Boxcar-Children-Books-1-4/dp/0807508543/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1283204433&sr=1-2),  and [Tom Sawyer.](http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Sawyer-Mark-Twain-Library/dp/0520266110/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1283204500&sr=1-1)

Sometimes we add time to our family travel just for these little moments. Days of important play.

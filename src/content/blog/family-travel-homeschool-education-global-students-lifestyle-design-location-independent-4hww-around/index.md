Family travel is the best education in the world and if you do [slow travel and extended travel internationally](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html), by [designing a lifestyle that is location independent](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html), the world becomes your classroom.Today it is easier than ever to [give your child a world class education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html) to prepare them to be global citizens of the 21st century on as little as 23 dollars a day per person.

That is what we have been living on since 2006, so know it can be done and the educational advantages have been astounding! Today you [can live, work and school ANY where](http://www.therawfeed.com/2009/07/how-digital-nomad-lifestyle-will-go.html) and this trend will only grow as the new economy and [technology makes it easier](http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/29/business/fi-nomads29) and [easier](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/25/AR2009072500878.html). This is part two in our ongoing "world school" education series. [Many top educational innovators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tahTKdEUAPk) admit schools are [not meeting the needs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnh9q_cQcUE&feature=related) of students with the [21st century skills](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l72UFXqa8ZU&feature=related) that they will have to have to thrive in the future.

"The jobs that these kids in school will be having, do not call for this kind of right-answer-vending-machine approach.They will be doing work that calls on their artistic abilities, that calls on their abilities of synthesis, that calls on their abilities of understanding the context, that calls on their abilities of working in teams, that calls on their abilities in some sense to be multi-disciplinary, multi-lingual, multi-cultural." [Daniel Pink](http://www.danpink.com/)

  
"So the coin of the realm is not memorizing the facts that they are going to need for the rest of their lives. The coin of the realm will be

\*do you know how to find information,  

\*do you know how to validate it,  

\*do you know how to synthesize it,  

\*do you know how to leverage it,  

\*do you know how to communicate it,

\*do you know how to collaborate with it,  

\*do you know how to problem solve with it.  

**That is the new 21st century set of literacies and it looks a lot different than the model that most of us were raised under."** [Clay Christensen](http://www.claytonchristensen.com/)

I think this article about [the collapse of complex business models](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/04/the-collapse-of-complex-business-models/) by [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/) explains a big part of our global transition now and why big, complex school systems [set up for the industrial age](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlBD75RfMtA&feature=player_embedded), just no longer work and will continue to collapse and not serve our needs.

**  
AFRAID TO HOMESCHOOL?**

It is not uncommon for homeschooling to sound scary or intimidating...it was for us as well, before we began...but just like extended travel or independent travel, it is MUCH easier than most people realize. There are also many online schools and courses if you prefer that method.  
  
It really is a false fear that you can not facilitate your child's learning which every good parent does from conception.Who helped facilitate your child to learn to walk or talk?? Parents are the primary educators of their children & every good parent should take full responsibility for their child's education, even if you do use schools. No teacher will ever love your child like you do & love/passion are the greatest tools to learning. It's really about trusting yourself and trusting your child. Learning is easy and natural.

“What children need is not new and better curricula but access to more and more of the real world; plenty of time and space to think over their experiences, and to use fantasy and play to make meaning out of them; and advice, road maps, guidebooks, to make it easier for them to get where they want to go (not where we think they ought to go), and to find out what they want to find out.” — [John Holt](http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Your-Own-John-Homeschooling/dp/0738206946/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270511212&sr=1-1)

Kids, all humans are geared to learn and parents have always been the first teachers. Most brain development takes place in the first 5 years..so most parents do all or most of the teaching/education in that time period! The rest is a piece of cake in comparison! It's really less about teaching and more about fascilitating or guiding and there are endless, free resources and support online for every age.

"This faith is that by nature people are learning animals. Birds fly; fish swim; humans think and learn. Therefore, we do not need to motivate children into learning by wheedling, bribing, or bullying. We do not need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning. What we need to do - and all we need to do - is to give children as much help and guidance as they need and ask for, listen respectfully when they feel like talking, and then get out of the way. We can trust them to do the rest."John Holt  
  
Did you know the literacy rate was higher BEFORE compulsory schooling began when most taught their own kids? Old ways of the industrial revolution, no longer serve in the internet/digital revolution & education/schools are going through a paradigm shift. I won't even speak to the major problems with funding schools in this new economy or the insane, crippling debt that too many go into to get a college education, except to say there are ways around these.  
  
I am not against schools and know a ton of amazing teachers including a niece who does remarkable work with disadvantaged and slow learners, but like most things, just blindly following the status quo, will rarely give you the best results. Embracing homeschooling/roadschooling can add a lot to your freedom (who wants to be tied to a school's schedule to time travel only at peak prices?) as well as greater bonding/ quality AND quantity time as a family.

“Nothing is REAL about what kids learn in school…they basically learn school-survival skills that are only useful in that setting, and when taken out into the \*real\* world, they are not so useful, effective or ~ more important ~ they are not the tools one needs in order to truly know one’s Self and to live a rich, full life.” — Anne Ohman  
  
Some of the most brilliant people [](http://learninfreedom.org/Nobel_hates_school.html)in [history were homeschooled](http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/20302) by ordinary parents. Most schools are meant to teach conformity which is the LAST thing that future 21st century global citizens will need.

"As a student in a digital world, tell me again why I need the building? The administration? The system?  
I don’t. And as accreditation becomes less meaningful because it’s easier to test the student than to test the system, the top heavy organizations will falter. And fast." Seth Godin

For us, the only real value to school is [language/culture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONPYysaauQM) immersion in a foreign land, connecting deeply with [local families through the local schoo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html)l and [friend consistency](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIoXlRXIRgk) while doing world travel (returning yearly for a few months)...but we also [picked a school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html) where we can come or go as we please, do an incomplete school year, & it has a very short school day. We'll do the same when we pick a school in Asia next winter to immerse in Mandarin Chinese.

“The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.” — George Bernard Shaw

How can I connect with my children today, bring joy into their lives, expand their worlds, nurture and encourage what they love to do?’ That’s my guideline. That and the dear hearts of my dear children. — Anne Ohman

WHAT ABOUT FRIENDS?**

This often seems to be [a common concern](http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/zysk1.html) from those who have never homeschooled, but it is [just not a problem](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/13/home-schooling-socialization-not-problem/). In fact, [many studies](http://www.homeschoolresourcecenter.net/article_homeschooled_kids__but_what_about_socialization.htm) show that [homeschooled kids](http://www.hslda.org/docs/nche/000000/00000017.asp) are actually better ["socialized"](http://learninfreedom.org/socialization.html) than many schooled kids. Based on all the homeschooled kids that I have known, including my twenty something niece who graduated years early from a top University in Chemical Engineering with a 6 figure job waiting for her, I have seen the truth of this in real life over and over again.

I see our digital nomad lifestyle as a great ADVANTAGE in socialization. Our child has had MORE opportunities to socialize with people of every age from so many countries, in several languages. We do take her needs seriously, so have created a system that gives her long term consistency, but feel it is a huge advantage that she is not confined to an artificial, age-specific peer group. She is capable now of making friends instantly with every age and has established lifelong connections around the globe. We also cherish the extra bonding time together.

“It is never too late to build family foundations,” says Dr. Nicholas Levy, a pediatrician affiliated with the Univ. of California, San Diego, who advocates traveling sabbaticals for families. “Travel, particularly international travel, exposes families to different lifestyles that intrinsically bring families together.” “Adaptation and accommodation are probably the most valuable lessons that we can teach our children,” Levy says.

I’m a big fan of [John Taylor Gatto](http://soultravelers3new.local/education.html) (an award winning teacher) & [love this article](http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/john_gatto.html) about why schools don’t educate. One of the worse things about schools (and the typically busy, over scheduled American life)  is that they leave no time to develop a sense of self. Schools were made for industrialization and simply no longer work for what we need in these [exponential times](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHmwZ96_Gos&feature=related) of the 21st century.

I talked about this in one of our very first posts called ["Timing Is Everything"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/timing-is-eve-1.html). We believe in the value of [attachment parenting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting)  not only for [babies](http://www.compleatmother.com/attachment.htm) ,but as a way of life since [parents are much more important than peers](http://www.amazon.com/Hold-Your-Kids-Parents-Matter/dp/0375760288/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270561951&sr=1-1) and conscious [parenting can help create a more peaceful world.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp8tKUQtEsk) 

"In a society that values its economy over culture, the book states, the building of strong adult/child attachments gets lost in the shuffle. Multiple play dates, day care, preschool and after school activities groom children to transfer their attachment needs from adults to their peers. They become what the authors call "peer oriented." The result is that they squelch their individuality, curiosity and intelligence to become part of a group whose members attend school less to learn than to socialize. And these same children are bullying, shunning and murdering each other, as well as committing suicide, at increasing rates." Publishers Weekly about "Hold on to Your Kids".  

"We should not be shocked then by the Smithsonian Report on genius which offered a three-part recipe for high achievement, consisting of 1) much time spent with warm, responsive parents and other adults, 2) very little time spent with peers, and  3) a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance." Dr Raymond Moore

  
In the next decade 60% of schools will be virtual. More and more jobs will be virtual as well. Flexible out-of-the-box multi-lingual global thinking citizens will do better in our coming world. The more we do this, the more I see what a fabulous way it is to learn and prepare for the future.

Most schools do a remarkably poor job of recognizing and rewarding future achievers...The standards of success in school have very little to do with standards thereafter. What did predict economic success was a willingness to take chances, more educational systems honor those who play it safe...The ones who do take chances have a hard time in school and are often penalized for their independent ways" Farson and Keyes

We are creating a one size fits all system that needlessly brands many young people as failure, when they might thrive if offered a different education whose progress was measured differently. Paradoxically we're embracing standardized tests just when the economy is eliminating standardized jobs." Robert Reich Former US Labor Secretary  

  

**HOW DO YOU MAKE IT WORK?**

We are strong believers in child led learning, that we are ALWAYS learning and that [the whole  world is our child's classroom.](http://www.amazon.com/Unschooling-Handbook-Whole-Childs-Classroom/dp/0761512764/ref=pd_sim_b_1) I suppose you could call us eclectic unschoolers. We always have wonderful books, creative supplies & learning tools around that she can choose at will and expose her to fun learning opportunities where ever we go. This costs less and takes up less space than you would imagine.

 Unschooling is primarily about process not content. The process of learning, the process of knowing yourself, openness, confidence, self-determination, independent thinking, critical thinking...none of which one gets when following other people's agenda.Making one's own agenda is what it is about. Again this is done , not in isolation, but in the context of one's family and community. - Joel Hawthorne

Our child is an advanced learner so can go at her own pace which is many years above her grade level. We homeschool a small amount daily at her level in English all year round and also use the local school in Spain for 4/5 months out of the year for deep immersion into her 2nd language, literature & culture. We discussed [more homeschooling details in this post](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html#more).

"World schooling" on a train ride in the UK, writing about recent events & reading_  

We plan to also immerse her into a 3rd language-Mandarin Chinese in the same way when we get to Asia this fall. Much of her homeschooling is done through her [reading (geared to our travels](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-finland-books-library-travel-with-kids-homeschool.html)) & other ways where she just thinks she is having fun. Below I will leave links including a great one about books that are fantastic  to combine with travel and an exciting thread (rich with links) about homeshooling/roadschooling/worldschooling older children including teens and tweens.

We also do her piano and violin lessons via Skype webcam from two different  teachers on another continent and do classes with [John Hopkin’s University CTY program online](http://cty.jhu.edu/) and other online opportunities. [Digital libraries](http://en.childrenslibrary.org/) and [Brainpop](http://www.brainpop.com/) are great fun for traveling homeschoolers too. There are a ton of free [educational games online like this family travel one](http://www.mywonderfulworld.org/toolsforadventure/games/family.html) or [this kid's typing one](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/typing/), but we also spend much time off line on old fashion games like Monopoly ( in Spanish), Set, Uno, Charades, Match ( using Unesco World Heritage Sites)  etc and playing soccer, tennis, swimming and biking etc and always creating together and separately in many diverse ways.

**Tips for getting started:** Read [John Taylor Gatto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto) and [John Holt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Holt_%28educator%29) (”father” of unschooling).

I am reading the delightful and enlightening book "What Really Matters" by my friends and veteran homeschooling parents/ pioneers [David Albert](http://www.skylarksings.com/ "David Albert") and [Joyce Reed](http://www.collegegoals.com/team/joyce_reed.html "joyce reed"), ( with brilliant, successful, happy college educated kids).. so thinking a lot about how we all learn and what is essential.

We really see everything as learning, so we are always "in school" and don't take a summer break. Our whole life is one big, [permanent vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "permament vacation, perpetual travel")! The local schools and [Chinese schools](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/chinese-school-fun.html "Chinese school ") here go from January through November, but it is back to school time for the International schools this week ( they go from August to June).  
  
Since our daughter, Mozart takes some extra curricular classes at one of the nearby International schools, it feels a little like "back to school time" here as well. She enjoys the classes, library, big piano to practice on and the social aspects as she has become good friends with this group of kids.

Mozart has passion for music and composing, so she has been taking [classes in piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ar90wOnWnM "classes in Piano online"), [violin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "violin around the world") and voice with local teachers that have come highly recommended.

We think time for [play is such an important part of learning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/the-importance-of-play-in-learning.html "time for play important in learning"), so support her [art and creativity](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/kids-art-creativity-travel-family-friendly-travel-education-homeschool-roadschool-.html "art and creativity in learning") in many ways and see it as a [kid-friendly travel perk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/kid-friendly-travel-perks.html "kid friendly travel perks") of our [minimalist](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist living family ") [travel lifestyle.

I love it when she shares her imaginary world with us, (that she creates out of nothing).. like this cardboard  bed, desk, books,denim book bag, posters, even bedspread made from her favorite T-shirt recycled ( so part of her [eco-friendly](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "eco friendly kid speech") and [frugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "best frugal minimalist tips") passion).

She usually [talks in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "learning mandarin in Asia") to [friends in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/making-friends-in-china-.html "friends in china") every night and sometimes manages to do [art projects](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/mobile-mozart-a.html "art projects") at the same time. She is doing great with her [Chinese tutor](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/tutoring-in-asia-why-asians-get-superior-test-scores.html "Chinese tutor in Asia") who comes here 4 times a week and is about to start 5th grade in [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "Mandarin ted talk inspiring speech by  a kid"), so has almost reached her [Mandarin fluency](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "Mandarin fluency goals") lofty goals ( while keeping up with her [Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning spanish in spain") and English literary goals as well).

If she is not [reading,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/best-family-travel-educational-tip.html "best family educational tips") she is [making something](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/creative-projec.html "creative projects for kids") and has had a passion for knitting ( for a while) which she has taught herself and designs lots of creative clothes ( I must blog about soon). She has a real [fashionista](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "fashionista traveling world") creative sense of style and recently made the most awesome purse for herself by recycling an old pair of jeans! ( Photo story coming!). She did such a great job, one would not guess it was handmade.

One of the advantages of [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") and mostly being [unplugged](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "unplugged") on our [ultimate family adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate family adventure") trip, ( thanks to my [health journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "healing journey")) is having the time to make [good friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "best friends around the world") and participate in lots of fun extra-curricular things like choir, drama, library time, recycle club, language jobs and girl scouts.  
  
She has a thriving social life with kids from her [Chinese school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "chinese school "), the international school and locals she meets in our apartment buildings,volunteering or even at book fairs, as well as keeping up with her [best friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/best-friends-forever-and-travel-.html "best friends forever") at a distance.  
  
![playing chess](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192ac8c0674970d.jpg)  
  
 We also just have a LOT of fun, just hanging out together playing games like chess, discussing things or just being silly, watching movies or [home movies and laughing a lot](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/long-term-family-travel-most-important-item.html "long term family travel most important item").

This is an old photo of Mozart reading a Chinese book, ( you can tell because that favorite T-shirt looks brand new and has now been recycled into the bespread shown above). I am really happy that I [raised a reader/ book worm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/10-tips-to-raise-a-reader-book-lover.html "how to raise a reader or book worm") and it always makes me smile to see her [reading books in 3 languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "reading books in 3 languages").  
  
[Back to school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html "first day of school") or [schools out forever](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "schools out forever")?

What have you or your kids been learning lately?

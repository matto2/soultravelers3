**STRADIVARIUS MUSEUM FOR VIOLIN KID**  
  
One such place was the Stradivarius Museum in Cremona, Italy. For a kid who has been playing violin since she was 23 months old and [playing violin around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "kid playing violin around the world") since she was 5, this [violin museum](http://www.museodelviolino.org/ "violin museum in Italy") was a must-see for our music-loving, arty family.

**CREMONA IS BIRTHPLACE OF STRADIVARI**  
  
This small, elegant town on the banks of the Po river was a music-making capital from the mid-16th century to through the late 1700's as well as the birthplace of the amazing Antonio Stradivari. It is a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00719 "Unesco site violin ")...perfect for violin and string instrument lovers! So we made a special stop with our [campervan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "camper van around europe travel").  
  
What makes a [Stradivari so special](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13856203 "what makes a stradivari so special")?  
  
"If you compare it to an old Italian painting, the Strad is an incredible historical artefact that needs to be preserved. It's a work of art." Ariane Todes  
  
**VIOLIN HISTORY, CULTURE AND ART**  
  
Many say, Cremona was also the birthplace of  the modern violin itself and the renowned Cremonese violin craftsman that made and continue to make the most beautiful-sounding string intruments like violins, violas and cellos in the traditional way passed down for generations.  
  
**MUSICAL HERITAGE**  
  
When we were in our [beloved Florence](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/more-fabulous-f.html "fabulous florence travel tips") once and saw the incomparable Stradivari collection aquired by the Medici court at the  Accademia Gallery ( Museo degli Strumenti Musicali), we knew we had to spend some time in Cremona and see this museum, as we wanted more.  
  
"We have focused on and put a lot of effort into trying to describe the history behind it – not only the object, but how the violin came to life in the 16th century, how it developed through the decades and centuries, and what is behind that. If you are able to see the violins being made, you can see the master violin-maker at work … you can understand more when you see the masterpiece. So in this way the museum is absolutely unique." Paolo Bodini ( Museum Director)  
  
We were really happy we didn't miss this rare gem. Have you seen it or is it on your list?

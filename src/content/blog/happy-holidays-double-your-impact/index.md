Wishing you and yours a wonderful holiday season! It was well worth the 35 plus hours, 2 taxis, 4 long plane rides with mucho turbulance, 1 air rail, 2 hour rental-car ride, 2 lost pieces of luggage ( eventually found after over a week)Â  to finally come home to [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "California travel") for Christmas!  
  
What a tender and sweet time to be with family as we enjoy the simple pleasures of cooking/baking together, walking on the beach, sharing stories, decorating trees with lots of hugs and laughter.

After a couple of years of mostly [tropical weather in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "how to winter in tropical Asia"), it actually feels magnificent to enjoy the crisp, cool, [sunny California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "sunny california ") days and wear sweaters again. What a joy too to be back in a country where there are crosswalks and overflowing health food stores.  
  
In some ways it feels like the USA is the most foreign of foreign countries for us ( we are clueless in handling smart phones or cable TV's with endless channels...though Mozart quickly leads at this), yet in other ways, it sometimes feels like we never left on [our world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family world tour") as we easily assimilate back to our old American ways.

**HOW CAN YOU DOUBLE YOUR IMPACT?**  
  
Please don't forget [Mozart's fundraiser to help the kids](http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=290456 "Mozart's fundraiser ") living in deep poverty. Thanks to a generous donor, ALL donations made to [Mozart's POP fundraising page](http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=290456 "Mozart's POP fundraider") on Monday, 12/30 will be matched dollar for dollar. WOW! [Click here and do it](http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=290456 "Mozart pencils of promise fundraiser") now! [http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=290456](http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=290456 "mozart's fundraiser")  
  

<iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MOM1LdMGsa0?rel=0" width="640"></iframe>

  
  
We are asking each of you to donate $5.00 to [Mozart's fundraiser](http://fundraise.pencilsofpromise.org/fundraise?fcid=290456 "Mozart's fundraiser") within the next 24 hours. Then our call to action is for you to ask 10 friends to do the same. Mozart would reach her goal in no time and these kids would have a school and a successful shot at life!

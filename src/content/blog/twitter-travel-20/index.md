Some of you probably do not even know what Travel 2.0 or Twitter is. I don't think I would know about them if it was not for our world tour. Some how it has flung us into a whole new world called [web2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 "wikipedia defining web2.0") because we are living lives as a [3 laptop family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/3-laptop-fami-2.html "soultravelers3 geeky explanations") which makes us traveling [digital nomads!](http://www.digitalnomads.com/ "Digital Nomads")

Web 2.0 and Travel 2.0 are about connection, communicating, collaborating and relationships. YOU are all part of our Travel 2.0 world tour! Isn't that fun?

It has been nothing less than astounding for us as we find ourselves touring the web2.0 world as we travel the real world. It has made a huge difference in our trip and makes us on the [cutting edge](http://www.johnchow.com/blogging-around-the-worldliterally/#comment-179042 "JohnChow with Gary Arndt guestpost") of a new way of being, that becomes [even more important in this economy.](http://www.techworld.com.au/article/268463/why_downturn_can_good_digital_nomads "why recession is good for digital nomads")

We find we are [trailblazers](http://www.edelmandigital.com/blog/2008/05/open_files_nine_digital_trends_1.html) in a world where [all one needs is a laptop to work](http://almostfearless.com/2009/01/19/becoming-a-digital-nomad-options-for-working-remotely-from-anywhere/ "how to work remotely") or [school anywhere](http://www.classroom20.com/) at [any](http://boards.bootsnall.com/advice-on-older-kids-education-needs-t40802.html "List of homeschooling resources 4 those on the road") time [while still being able to compete](http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/04/09/230224/global-village-to-impact-on-working-practices.htm) with large corporations or [top educational institutions](http://mayafrost.com/new-global-student-FAQ.htm "Maya Frost's great book on Global students"). I see it as opening up more freedom for us all!

Recently I did an interview with Kim Mance a free lance writer with [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) who also is a co-founder of  an exciting  travel magazine called [Gogalavanting](http://www.gogalavanting.com/). We met on Twitter some months ago. (By the way, [Arianna Huffington](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington) is an old friend and neighbor  of mine from the days I lived in New York City long ago and was one of the first to understand the importance of community on the internet).

I was really impressed with an article Kim wrote about [why travel is important](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-mance/does-travel-really-matter_b_142271.html) & am excited about the [Travel Blog Exchange community](http://www.travelblogexchange.com/) that she recently started.

 There are some glitches in the video because it was a "live" interview with her in Chicago and me in Spain, but it speaks to the way technology is quickly changing how we do business in today's world. I am honored that she chose to include us in  her Notable Travelers Series.

"Travel 2.0" is all about how internet connections are changing travel and we are perfect examples!

  

  

  
I joined Twitter about a year ago, primarily to have a way to connect with family while we are on the move as there is not always the time to post things on the blog or call.  Both can be expensive if we can not find free wifi, so time is of the essence and Twitter is quick.  I found that with [Twitpic,](http://twitpic.com/tag/soultravelers3 "Twitpic tag page, click on photos") it was also  a great way to give a "real time" quick peek to our readers on Twitter, letting them know about the stories to come.

Little did I know that I would also meet some amazing people there like [Guy Kawasaki](http://twitter.com/guykawasaki "http://twitter.com/guykawasaki") with his superb [Alltop Travel](http://travel.alltop.com/) ([and others](http://alltop.com/)), one of my favorite [blogs](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/) and "must have" new book, [Reality Check](http://www.guykawasaki.com/books/)! Don't you love that smile?

Or the fabulous [Wendy Perrin](http://twitter.com/wendyperrin) from [Conde Nast Traveler](http://twitter.com/CNTraveler) and amiable  [Elliott Ng](http://twitter.com/elliottng) from [Uptake](http://www.uptake.com/). There is no way I would have met these people or other innovative people like [Liz Strauss](http://twitter.com/lizstrauss), [Chris Brogan](http://twitter.com/chrisbrogan), [Laura Fitton](http://twitter.com/Pistachio), [Mari Smith,](http://twitter.com/marismith) [Kelby Carr](http://twitter.com/typeamom), [Lucretia M. Pruitt](http://twitter.com/GeekMommy), [Jim Long](http://twitter.com/newmediajim) , [Gary Vee](http://twitter.com/garyvee)  [Sarah Evans](http://twitter.com/PRsarahevans),  and  so many more that have touched our lives.

We have over 4000 people following us on Twitter and they have been a wonderful help on our travels in so many ways. Recently I was introduced to [Benji Lanyado](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/benjilanyado) on twitter from another friend who writes about travel @[ben\_coop](http://twitter.com/ben_coop)  ( who is a Web Editor for [Roughguides.com](http://www.roughguides.com/) amongst other things and has a passion for Andalusia like us).

Benji writes for the [UK Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/feb/02/paris-twitter-trip-twitrip "UK Guardian")  and had the fantastic  idea to do a [TwiTrip  ,](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/jan/28/twitter-travel-trips "UK Guardian about TwiTrip")which translates to doing a cutting edge trip depending on ["live" tweets](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23twitrip "collection of tweets for twitrip from London to Paris") from  unknown people via Twitter for places to stay, eat or visit. It was an experiment to see how it would work  from London to Paris and since Twitter has been such an awesome tool for us, I was intrigued and happy to jump in to help.

I was thrilled that he stayed at the [Paris hotel](http://www.eldoradohotel.fr/EHBDupF1.html "Paris hotel at great price!") that we suggested and that he was kind enough to give us a mention and link in his [Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/feb/02/paris-twitter-trip-twitrip "Soultravelers3 in Guardian") ! I have to  pass on that credit to [@ewanderlust](http://www.enduringwanderlust.com/ "enduring wanderlust website")  who along with many others gave me great ideas to answer Benji's question about a "cool/cheap place in Paris for under 75 Euros?".

The good news about getting insider hints from around the twitosphere? It is easy for you to have that information now  if you are headed to Paris! If you look at [my favorites](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3/favourites?page=8 "cheap/cool Paris hotels/lodging ") you will see that now we have a record of them. Thanks so much to  [@budtravel](http://budgettravel.com/ "budget travel website"), [@writingtravel](http://www.writingtravel.com/), [@prmaria](http://www.globalmediapr.com/ "globalmediapr"), [@thefutureisred](http://www.thefutureisred.typepad.com/), [@jaypiddy](http://jaypiddy.com/)  [AlexBerger](http://virtualwayfarer.com/) [@airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/) **[@emused](http://lisapoisso.wordpress.com/)**  [@mallorcavilla](http://www.honorvell.com/)  and also the people from Facebook that helped ( my Twitter account and Facebook are linked).

 The circular nature of the web2.0 world is demonstrated by how I shared a highlight of Twitter for us in an online conversation with Benji, about our special [Halloween with Wendy Perrin's family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/01/my-entry.html) that she wrote about on her Conde Nast Traveler's blog, [the Perrin Post](http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/blogs/perrinpost/2008/11/a-halloween-wit.html "special Halloween with Wendy Perrin & family!") and then later,  she happened to link to that article about his [Twitrip](http://ow.ly/def "Perrin Post on Twitrip").

She noted how people like _The New York Times_' [Clive Thompson](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all) and [MSNBC's Chris Elliott](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28623823/) have already explained the power of Twitter. Then while I was writing this, Margaret, a regular reader of this blog, sent me a link via [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=23138026952) to an good article about [Twitter and Journalism](http://blogs.reuters.com/fulldisclosure/2009/01/30/twittering-away-standards-or-tweeting-the-future-of-journalism/).

The story seemed to zip through the travel cyber community with posts from [National Geographic Traveler's Intelligent Travel blog](http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/intelligenttravel/2009/02/twittering-while-traveling.html "Intelligent Travel Blog by National Geographic Traveler"), [Make Travel Fair](http://www.maketravelfair.co.uk/2009/02/02/is-twitter-the-greatest-source-of-travel-intelligence/),  [Short Breaks](http://www.short-breaks.com/blog/?p=439),  [Andy Roberts](http://distributedresearch.net/blog/2009/02/05/south-of-pigalle-paris-breaks-competition), [@brilliantips](http://twitter.com/BrilliantTips) had several including [one that included us!](http://blog.brillianttrips.com/2009/02/travel-tweets-a-night-out-in-paris/ "Brilliant Trips")

Most of the [top travel people](http://www.elliott.org/blog/50-travel-twitterers-you-must-follow/ "50 travel twitterers you must follow ") are [on Twitter](http://travel-industry.uptake.com/blog/2009/01/16/travel-twitterers/ "Elliott Ng's 200 travelers on Twitter list") so we have created an exciting community and [hashtags](http://www.twitip.com/tweet-your-message-to-a-larger-audience-with-hashtags/ "Twitip on hashtags") like #travel, #paris, #Spain, #twchat and #tbex help when you use [twitter search](http://search.twitter.com/ "twitter search") .[  
](http://www.tourismkeys.ca/blog/2009/02/a-conversation-about-bloggers-and-their-networks/ "Todd Lucier")

[Todd Lucier](http://www.tourismkeys.ca/blog/2009/02/a-conversation-about-bloggers-and-their-networks/ "Todd Lucier") just had a fascinating conversation with three travel blogging network experts (and my friends from Twitter)  @[SEKeener](http://twitter.com/SEKeener) , @elliottng and [@KimMance](http://twitter.com/kimmance) about travel, relationships and community. He recently also did an [interesting podcast](http://www.tourismkeys.ca/blog/?s=sheila+scarborough "podcast with sheila scarborough and Pam Mandel") with my  cool  travel writer friends [@sheilaS](http://twitter.com/SheilaS "twitter Sheila Scarborough") and [@nerdseyeview](http://twitter.com/nerdseyeview?page=1 "Pam Mandel on twitter") who are doing a travel workshop at [SXSW](http://sxsw.com/ "sxsw").

I love how Twitter helps make the joy of travel easier than ever today through connecting and relationships. Now that is what I call travel 2.0! Feel free to join me if you have not already and make sure you use the @soultravelers3 so I can hear you! Join in the conversation!.

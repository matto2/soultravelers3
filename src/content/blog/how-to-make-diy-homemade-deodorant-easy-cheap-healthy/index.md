it is so much healthier for you

Why make your own world's best deodorant? First, because it is so much healthier for you and also because it is cheaper and so easy to do. We're living in the tropics, I take saunas every day, so since this works for my husband and I, it surely will work for anyone.  
  
On my [travel healt](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "travel health")h journey, I've discovered that there is more to [healthy secrets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "healthy secrets for travel") than just [organic food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic food and travel").  I started reading about how [many harmful chemicals](http://www.naturalnews.com/033364_deodorants_chemical_ingredients.html?Click=43799 "many harmful chemicals in deodorant") in deodorant and other every-day [beauty supplies](http://www.healthychild.org/blog/comments/fragrance_in_perfumes_and_cosmetics/ "dangerous chemicals in beauty supplies") that most of us regularly use and the the [damage they can do](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/29/cbsnews_investigates/main5123621.shtml "damage from deodorant").  
  
We already use a natural toothpaste that we make and natural shampoo and creme rinse, ( recipes coming) but I thought deodorant would be too hard. I have long heard that the aluminium in deodorant is especially dangerous, ( as well as Parabens, Phthalates, tricloan and Proylene glcol), but now I am tweaking everything and don't want to pay the high price of organic beauty products when I can make my own simply. ( They are also not that easy to find on the road of [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "world travel")).  
  
I was wrong, making your own deodorant is sooo easy! If you want something fancier, I saw [this one](http://www.crunchybetty.com/solving-the-worlds-deodorant-crisis-a-new-soothing-recipe "homemade deodorant") and this one [made with probiotics](http://frugallysustainable.com/2011/11/homemade-probiotic-deodorant-that/ "probiotics homemade deodorant") online, but the one I make is so much easier and I am into simplicity and ease. Less is more in my world, but your mileage may vary. You can actually make a deodorant with each of these separately, but I like them together.

**SUPER EASY 2 INGREDIENT DIY HEALTHY DEODORANT**  
  
  
My husband came home from the store with a typical bottled deodorant. I read deeply, and sure enough it had waaay too [many chemicals](http://www.ewg.org/node/8168 "many chemicals") including aluminium, so I threw it out, but saved the bottle after washing thoroughly. It took a LOT to get that perfume smell out ( [yucky chemicals](ost.com/2010/07/22/toxic-chemicals-in-beauty_n_639418.html#s111546&title=Phthalates_and_bisphenol "yucky chemicals")).  
  
It is easy to pop off the top ( I used a small knife and I have refilled it several times now). Then fill it with organic virgin coconut oil ( at room temp if you live in a cold climate) and a little natural baking soda ( aluminium-free).  Shake and put the top back on.  
  
Voila! You now have an amazing deodorant.  
  
**JUST LEMON WORKS TOO AS A DEODORANT**  
  
Why the lemons in the photo? It's another natural deodorant that works well, is cheap and usually easily accessable. I use lemons every morning as I wake up,  squeezed into some warm water ( sometimes combined with ginger and organic cinnomon) so I have lots of left over lemons.  
  
Take the sqeezed lemons or even a slice of one and swipe it on your armpits. Voila..another great, natural, cheap deodorant. It is not quite as strong as the coconut oil, but works good on a normal day. Also I have read that one can dry it in the sun and then grind up the lemon peels for a great antipersperant, but I haven't tried it because it seemed too much trouble when I have what works.  
  
These two simple solutions work well for the traveler as well as those at home. We're all bombarded with toxins daily in our environment and that takes a health toll for us as individuals as well as the planet, so why not find a cheap, natural way?  
  
Are you a holistic family looking for green solutions?

Where is the real [Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "best of beijing travel")? Most people will tell you it is in the [Beijing Hutong area](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/yum-loving-the-food-in-beijing.html "beijing hutong area food") because it exemplfies the history and culture of [old Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/-summer-palace-sunset-in-beijing-china.html "old beijing travel spots").

The hutongs in Beijing go back to the days of Kublei Khan, but sadly many have been torn down for the high rises.  
  
Much more coming on this exciting area, but just a little taste from this photo. As DaVinci said, it looks like Christmas in Beijing every night!

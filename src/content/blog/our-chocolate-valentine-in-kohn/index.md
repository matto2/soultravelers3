Mmmm! The delicious chocolate fragrance  greeted us as we enter the door of this impressive neo-eclectic structure on the Rhine and the oozing chocolate fountain with scrumptious free samples delighted Mozart to no end!

We hoped it would make a perfect Valentine for all of you chocolate lovers out there, so Happy Valentine's Day!

  

  
"My love is as deep (as the sea), the more I give thee, the more I have, for both are infinite." Shakespeare  
  
  
We had a fabulous time exploring this famous Chocolate Museum [(Schokolademuseum)](http://www.schokoladenmuseum.de/index_e.html "Schokolademuseum/chocolate museum website") in Kohn/Colgne, Germany! We missed the [Cadbury factory](http://www.cadburyworld.co.uk/CadburyWorld/Pages/CadburyWorld.aspx) when in the UK, so promised Mozart we would go to this [Lindt](http://www.lindt.com/2865/2866.asp) factory. They have more than 5 million visitors a year! One great thing about open ended family travel, we can always be flexible.  
  
Germany is famous for it's [chocolate](http://chocolocate.com/country.php/Germany/0) and Kohn is the chocolate capital. The enormous Stollwerck chocolate company was based in Kohn and it was once, the second largest supplier of chocolate to  
the US.  
  
It's actually a great [home school](http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/manufacture_interactive/manufacture.html "Homeschool on chocolate") [field trip](http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/ "virtual chocolate homeschool fieldtrip") because it's a complete history through the world of chocolate production starting with  pictures of cacao plants and takes the visitor through the entire production process from the bean all the way to bar! There is a lot of hands-on experience through each stage including making some for demonstration purposes (about 400 kilograms).  
  
The history is laid out nicely by honoring the South American origins of chocolate and the role it played South American society as well as in the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe when chocolate was expensive and thus only enjoyed by the wealthy. We also really enjoyed the advertising and commercials through time.  
  
Now, this is a fun way to learn and we munched our way as we learned and enjoyed. There was even a fun digital test in the end to see if we were paying attention.  
  
We passed with flying colors! We had a great time in the nearby cathedral and visiting the whole city, but this was our favorite spot!  
  
Here are a few more links [about chocolate](http://www.hersheys.com/discover/tour_video.asp "Hershey factory video")  & [Valentine's Day](http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/articles/020606.htm) that are [educational](http://www.mce.k12tn.net/chocolate/charlie/charlie_and_the_chocolate_factor.htm "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Activities") for our [homeschool](http://jhcckkm.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/free-chocolate-unit-study/) readers. What is your favorite part about learning all about chocolate?

Do you like Twitter? It's been an unexpected an  amazing help on our [peripatetic global journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) as we knew nothing about [social media with travel](http://dannybrown.me/2010/04/07/social-media-and-travel-by-jeanne-dee/)  before we began our [family world tour in 2006](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/timing-is-eve-1.html). I wrote a while ago about [Twitter & Travel 2.0](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/twitter-travel-20.html) and I recently commented to [Chris Guillebeau](http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/) on [The Art of Non-conformity](http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/) when I agreed with him about it's surprising value;

"So many people think Twitter is a waste of time, but it’s been a phenomenal resource for us as we travel the world ( yet I doubt I would even know about it without our travel lifestyle). Not only did it get us featured in the [New York Times](http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/qa-with-jeanne-dee-the-nomadic-family-traveler/) and the [UK Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/jan/03/travel-gurus-2010-guide) ( out of the blue through DM’s), [a fantastic Halloween](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html) with [Conde Nast Traveler](http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler)’s [Wendy Perrin and family](http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/blogs/perrinpost/2008/11/a-halloween-wit.html), an [awesome violin teache](http://www.violinexplorer.com/)r who works over Skype internationally… to name just a few of the wonders, but also helped our family find us when [I landed in the hospital after a bike wreck in Austria](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html)."

There is a tradition to recommend others on Twitter every Friday and it is called #followfriday. Sometimes it can be overwhelming. I usually get too many to thank everyone individually and I often want to recommend all of my followers. One thing I suggest if you like to follow people with a passion for travel is to follow the people on [my Twitter travel lists](http://twitter.com/#/list/soultravelers3/travelers). 

I'm going to try to start a tradition of listing great people on Twitter to follow every Friday ( or the Fridays that I can). There are so many great people, I will never run out of possibilities, but here are a few to start the ball rolling in no particular order:

[1)  @wendyperrin-](http://twitter.com/wendyperrin)

What's not to like about this [icon of  travel](http://wendyperrin) who often brings her wonderful kids and amazing photographer husband along with her on her travels? Always friendly, always great advice!

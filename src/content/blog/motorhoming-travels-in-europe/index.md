Motorhoming around  
Europe is the very best  
way to see and explore it

[Motorhoming around Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html "motorhoming around Europe") is the very best way to see and explore it in my opinion, particularly wonderful if you are [traveling Europe as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "traveling Europe as a family") or want to [get to know Europeans](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "get to know europeans"). Why? Cheap, no packing and unpacking, [save a bundle on food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "eating cheap in Europe") by cooking most of your own, being outside, living a resort life, have a never ending supply of [friends for the kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "friends for kids while traveling") and fun things to do when not touring like pools, playgrounds, [free kids clubs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "camping europe free kids clubs") etc..  
  
There are 10,000 -plus campgrounds in Europe, so not a city or site that doesn't have one nearby as it is the preferred budget way to vacation or "holiday" for middle class Europeans. This photo was taken at one of our [visits to Vienna](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/02/vienna-a-little.html "visiting Vienna"), sharing [favorite travel toys](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/best-toys-for-travel-.html "favorite travel toys") with two brothers from the UK.  
  
We tend to stay in campgrounds, but one can save even more money by wild camping. If you are outside the high season, even [luxury campgrounds can be very cheap](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "luxury campgrounds in Europe for cheap") like eight euros a night in June or September in [Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/tennis-anyone.html#more "camping and tennis in Portual ") or eleven for Barcelona at the beach, even less for a long stay. Put bikes on the back for even greater freedom and fun like [biking the vineyards of Bordeaux!

I love this positve motorhoming Europe article from [Transitions Abroad](http://www.transitionsabroad.com/publications/magazine/0411/motor_homing_in_europe.shtml) written by a tour guide who has tried every possible way of travel. Cynthia Harriman, author of [Taking your Kids to Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/books_europe/index.html) also highly recommends this route for families. Surprisingly, the small space is not that hard to adjust to since you have the outdoors as your living room, and if you go slow, it is also not very expensive for gas as one is usually parked, taking mass transit, bikes, even long ferry rides which saves tremendously.  
  
One of our best decisions on our [around-the-world trip as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world family trip"), was to [buy a small European motorhome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/our-new-camper.html "how to buy European motorhome") that we have used now for 6 years and plan to continue for many more. It's easy and cheap to keep there and gives us a perfect home/vehicle/storage unit for Europe that is also green and sustainable. If you explore our site by places visited, we almost always list the campsites we stayed at.

What is the [secret for getting on TV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/digital-nomad-global-kid-tv-stories.html "secret of getting on TV")? Today, everyone's a reality TV star from [American Idol](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/digital-nomad-global-kid-tv-stories.html "American idol") to [The Amazing Race](http://www.theamazingracecasting.com/ "the amazing race"), so just applying might be the easiest way. Or perhaps the secret to getting on TV is just [doing what you love](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/advice-to-college-grads-from-a-world-traveler.html "do what you love - advice for college grads") and [willing to be different](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/being-different-its-a-good-thing.html "willing to be different").  
  
It was never part of our plan for our [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world trip"), but in our almost [8 years of non-stop travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "8 years of non-stop travel"), we've managed to be on TV all over the world multiple times and unlike most [travel bloggers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/top-travel-bloggers-of-2013-soultravelers3-wins-.html "travel bloggers soultravelers3 wins best 2013"), we've never sent out one press release.  
  
We were [interviewed by the BBC](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "BBC interviews soultravelers3 on social media and travel") in London, [FOX TV in the USA](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/soultravelers3-digital-nomad-family-on-fox-tv-.html "soultravelers3 on fox TV")., on [Japanese show while in Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/mozarts-film-de.html "Japanese show croatia") with a [top star](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/japan-star-more.html "Japanese star Maako"), on Hong Kong TV and China TV, [BBC around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/bbc-world-news-featured-soultravelers3-youtube-viral-travel-video-fast-track-bbcnews.html "soultravelers3 on BBC about world trip") and more. These opportunities seem to come to us out of thin air, but it has added to the fun and [world school learning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html/ "world school, unschool, homeschool and travel") for Mozart's primary years.

Cool too that our first [Soultravelers3 Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 youtube") video went viral ( almost 2 million views) and has been seen on TV around the world many times.We've been blessed with many viral travel videos.  

One of the most fun TV interview times was during [Chinese New Year in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Chinese New Year Penang Georgetown") when we were doing [multigenerational travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "multigenerational travel"). Just for kicks and travel memories, we had [my mom](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/worlds-best-mot.html "world's best mom") and Mozart wear traditional dress ( Cheongsum) and had no idea we would attract so much attention.

Mozart and my 84 year old mother were treated like rock stars and ended up on several international TV shows and inÂ  several papers. Mozart got to talk in [fluent Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent mandarin") to a huge Chinese audience. Every where they went people wanted to take photos of them or with them. It actually really added to the [magic](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/family-travel-year-of-the-rabbit-in-asia-photos-chinese-new-year-.html "magical chinese new year") of the day and a lasting, unique, special travel memory that will stay with us forever.

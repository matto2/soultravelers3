Looking for a healthy soda pop alternative for your kid, teen or tween? Do you hate those unhealthy Cokes, Sprites and other yucky carbonated, sugary beverages that tempt them left and right and are some of the most popular junk food drinks [harming our kids today](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM "sugar harms kids and adults")?  
  
We're into [healthy food as we travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "healthy food while traveling"), so always on the lookout for easy, cheap, healthy alternatives like [healthy popcorn](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/how-to-make-healthy-popcorn.html#more "healthy popcorn "), [lacto-fermented chutney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-mango-papaya-chutney.html "lacto fermented chutney- how to make"), [healthy popsicles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-make-healthy-popsicles-.html#more "healthy popsicles - how to make"), [healthy DIY deodorant](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-diy-homemade-deodorant-easy-cheap-healthy.html "healthy DIY deodorant"), and various [healthy snacks for kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/healthy-snacks-for-kids.html#more "healthy snacks for kids"). Why feed them sugar and junk food when they can feast on yummy things full of great nutrition and learn good habits from an early age?  
  
This is the one that Mozart and her friends love and we parents like it because we know how healthy it is. We've thought about [water kefir soda](http://www.cheeseslave.com/how-to-make-homemade-soda-pop-with-kefir-grains/ "water kefir soda"), but haven't gotten around to it because we already have goatmilk kefir and [coconut milk kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "coconut milk kefir - how to make") daily and this is so much easier and she can do it all by herself when in the mood.  
  
**This is all you need:**  
  
Perrier ( full of nutritious magnesium and potassium in it)  
  
Passion fruit ( chock full  of vitamins A, C, B6, iron, riboflavin, niacin, magnesium, phosphorus,etc)  
  
2 cups and a strainer  
  
Here is how she makes it:  
  
**1) Cut the Passion fruit in half**  
  
**2) Scoop out the center and put in a cup**  
  
**3) Strain out the juice from that cup into another**  
  
**4) Add some Perrier**  
  
**Voila! That's it!**  
  
Add ice if you like things super cold  or a little raw unheated honey if you want it very sweet. Let your kids drink as much as they like and have fun making it too!

One of our great travel pleasures of 2018, was discovering one of [California's most beautiful beaches](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html " California's most beautiful beaches")! El Matador State Beach is one of the best kept secrets of [Los Angeles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/08/travel-to-la-without-a-car-.html "Los Angeles without a car"). Not as popular as the beautiful beaches of Santa Monica, Venice, Hermosa, Manhattan or Newport beaches, but known by some photographers and filmmakers who like to catch the "golden hour" at sunset there because the rocks make it so photogenic. Sunrises and [sunsets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2017/03/catching-the-best-california-sunset-in-los-angeles-.html "best sunset beach in california ") are spectacular!

[Teen pop star Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2018/12/pop-singer-mozart-performs-at-simin-hope-foundations-winter-festival.html#more "teen pop star Mozart Dee") recently filmed her latest music video on this gorgeous, natural beach and it will be releasing soon,( much different than her ["Push You Harder" Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5n67SVQVB8 "Push you harder by Mozart ")). Thus, this is how we discovered this exquisite spot. One thing to caution you about is checking the tide before going,  as the second day of shooting there, it was high tide and most of these rocks were all immersed and a more dangerous beach.

It is a lovely drive out to Malibu and there are picnic tables at the top of the beach near where there is parking for a small fee ( or you can park on the road).

It is not a beach for those that have trouble with steep hill and stairs, but that is pretty typical of many Malibu beaches. The lack of parking and steep terrain and far out location helps keep it an uncrowded beach, especially in winter, even on 70 and 80 degree days which are common in a California winter.

It hasn't been long since the horrible fires in Malibu that destroyed many homes including a few of the people we know, which was tragic and sad. It was shocking to see that the fire went all the way to edge of the top of this cliff before this beach, although it did not mar it's beauty. In fact, this burnt tree looking out to the sea and a single sailboat had a beauty of it's own and it was encouraging to know this area is already regenerating and reclaiming all of it's peace and magnificence.

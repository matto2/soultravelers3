As I looked out my [kitchen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/omg-an-oven-in-asia.html "kitchen in Asia") window at this beautiful [tropical island paradise](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/tropical-island-paradise.html "tropical island paradise") on this July 4th, I couldn't help but think about [freedom](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "Early retirement and perpetual travel") and how our [nomadic travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "nomadic travel lifestyle") has allowed us so much of that quality.

Let us ponder and create more freedom together.

"You can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom." Malcolm X  
  
"As human beings we all want to be happy and free from misery.  
We have learned that the key to happiness is inner peace.  
The greatest obstacles to inner peace are disturbing emotions such as  
anger and attachment, fear and suspicion,  
while love and compassion, a sense of universal responsibility  
are the sources of peace and happiness." Dalai Lama  
  
"Freedom is the oxygen of the soul." Dayan  
  
"Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility" Freud  

"All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom." Einstein

“Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.” Gandhi  
  
"And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our fear, our presence automatically liberates others." Williamson

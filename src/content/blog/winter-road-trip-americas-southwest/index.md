The American Southwest is a diverse region full of delights, so we packed up the car and headed out from [California's oldest beach town](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California beach town Capitola"), across the state and then over 1694 miles or 2776 Km's across Arizona, New Mexico and West Texas. This [road trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "road trip usa") had a [homeschool](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool and travel") theme to show our [most well-traveled child](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "Most well traveled child in the world") more of her own beautiful country.  
  
We were blessed with this car on loan from one side of our family and gifted with this little silver angel to give us luck from the other side during our [happy holiday visit](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/happy-holidays-double-your-impact-.html "happy holiday visit") and we indeed had great luck and sun all along the way.

This road trip of the west was a fast planned, "wing it" type trip that kept changing even as we drove it. Many warned us not to go to Grand Canyon or Santa Fe in the winter, so we had to have multiple possibilities, but it turned out to be the pefect time to go. We could have taken a safer route, but I thought why not live on the wild side and go for the gold of what we wanted.

We are known for [packing light](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/top-travel-tip-for-long-term-travel.html "packing light secrets") on our [world travels](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family world travels"), but it is a small car and we needed all our possesions/winter clothes for 6 months, plus a [Paleo/Primal, gluten-free, grain-free, GAPS/WAPF style diet](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/01/travel-and-paleoprimal-grain-free-gapswapf-healthy-eating.html "paleo primal eating and travel") for our [healing journey.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "healing journey") Not to mention my [zillions of supplements](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "traveling when sick"), so we were packed tight.

Luckily from all that [RVing around Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "RVing around Europe") and world travel, Mozart is a flexible kid ( and a [book loving reade](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/10-tips-to-raise-a-reader-book-lover.html "how to raise a reader")r) and we are use to problem solving and creative solutions to make most anything work. That is part of the thrill of our [digital nomad lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomad lifestyle") and keeps us on our toes.  
  
Only our first drive day was unbearably long, so we really enjoyed the relaxed pace, landscapes and the time together. We did picnics on the move often and worked well as a team. Quick stops at odd places for gas and bathroom breaks some how seemed vastly entertaining and adventures to move our cramped  muscles while running, holding hands and laughing in the fresh air.

I had planned to share one of my fave places in Texas  Big Bend National Park and explore the Hill Country which is the most beautiful part of Texas, but we decided midstream that was overly ambitious and we would do that as a separate road trip later.  
  
We enjoyed the ever changing views ( each state really has a unique landscape) and Mozart learned more about Indian country, the American West and the Mother Road, Route 66. She got some first hand look at tumble weeds as they scattered in the wind in front of us, played in snow, watched an old west gun fight and talked to native Americans.

We don't have a smart phone purposely and enjoy navigating with maps the old fashion way. We have a GPS in our [RV in Europe,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "camping europe") but won't get back to that until this summer, but didn't need it for this trip at all. We had many great discussions, some car dancing, singalongs, games and only had internet when at a motel or resort at night. We love the mostly [unplugged life](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "unplugged lifestyle luxury")!

We did explore a bit of the historic Route 66 in 3 states and I will be writing more about that. Our basic route was [Santa Cruz](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-santa-cruz-california-beautiful-beach-house-homeaway-luxury-rental-home.html "santa cruz california beach rental") to Fresno, then a very long days drive to Williams, Arizona where we took the [cool train into the Grand Canyon](http://www.thetrain.com/ "Crand Canyon Railway Train") for a few days. We loved our stay at the [Grand Canyon Railway Hotel](http://www.thetrain.com/offers-packages/ "Grand Canyon railway hotel") and on the rim next to the [El Tovar](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/el-tovar-409.html "El Tovar on Grand Canyon rim") at the [Kachina Lodge](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/kachina-lodge-410.html "Kachina Lodge at Grand Canyon") with the most spectacular view of the Canyon from our comfy room!

I have been wanting to take my Beloveds to the Grand Canyon for a while and we finally made it. T'was the perfect time to go and the weather gods were on our side, so Mozart and DaVinci experienced the Canyon at it's most perfect on their first visit.  
  
Then we went onto Albuquerque, followed by a few days in blissful [Santa Fe at the Four Seasons Resort](http://www.fourseasons.com/santafe/ "Four Seasons Resort Santa Fe"), which I will be telling you much more about. Proceeded by more travel into Texas, waking up to a nail in our tire one morning in the middle of nowhere on the way, then four fabulous days in Dallas at another amazing [Four Seasons Resort](http://www.fourseasons.com/dallas/ "Four Seasons Resort Dallas").  
  
We had such great weather, such a good time experiencing so many wonders, such amazing delicious and healthy food that I am now convinced January might be the best time in the world to do a road trip! Many more photos and details coming soon.

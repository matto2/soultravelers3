**GROUNDING OR EARTHING**  
  
"Earthing" also called "grounding" stems from the idea that in modern city life we no longer have direct physical contact with the Earth, and therefore are losing out on purported health benefits of exchanging electrons with the surface of our planet. A handful of small studies have found that grounding appears to provide some general health benefits, such as better sleep, less pain, reduced stress and tension, and better immune function compared to study participants who weren't grounded. One study suggested that earthing eliminates the potentially harmful effects of the electromagnetic fields given off by all the electronic devices that surround us." Andrew Weil, M.D.

**CAN GOING BAREFOOT HELP HEALTH?**  
  
"Earthing may be one of the most important overlooked factors in public health. When grounding is restored, many people report significant improvement in a wide range of ailments, including chronic fatigue. Studies have shown that earthing or grounding improves blood viscosity, heart rate variability, inflammation, cortisol dynamics, sleep, autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance, and reduces effects of stress." Dr. Mercola

**OUR PRIVATE OASIS**  
  
I am not sure if this helps or not, but it is an enjoyable and easy addition to our day. I love this little jungle-like oasis and ancient tree in our [Penang apartment](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/penang-apartment-or-condo-rental-plenty-of-choices.html "Penang apartment") building and we are always the only ones there during the day.  
  
![playing ball in our little jungle oasis](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019104ade92f970c.jpg)  
  
Just being around beautiful trees and plants makes me happy and the shade, quiet and greenery reminds me again that I am on a [tropical island paradise](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/tropical-island-paradise.html "tropical island paradise").

We could walk to the beach, but that would mean [crossing high traffic roads](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/getting-around-penang-by-bus.html "getting around Penang by bus"), which is my [least favorite part of Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/big-rats-in-asia.html "big rats in Asia"), so I don't really see me feeling motivated enough to do that daily. Plus that would take up more time.  
  
![Grounding - Earthing - Nature = Better Health](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019104adeaa7970c.jpg)  
  
But playing with my kid in this natures nook or gabbing with her or my husband, listening to the birds chirp or lazily watching clounds float by on the blue sky and running my feet through the grass, is certainly relaxing and pleasurable.

I am more of a country person now, than a city person and [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang for the winter") and [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/weird-asia.html "weird Asia") has more towers and traffic than what I prefer, but daily time in this isolated garden area always makes me smile.

I don't think I will buy the [commercial grounding products](http://wellnessmama.com/5600/how-to-get-healthy-while-you-sleep/ "grounding products") that they sell ( quite expensive), but going barefoot in a beautiful part of nature seems like an effortless way to add more health to one's life!  
  
How do you find ways to sneak in grounding, barefoot, unplugged and/or nature time to your day?

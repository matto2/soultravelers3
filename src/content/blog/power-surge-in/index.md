There is more to Galicia than just Santiago! We found Galicia to be one of the most pristine and spectacular areas that we have seen so far. The countryside and dramatic coasts are gems that many people miss, even those who go to Santiago de Compostela. We will be writing more on this topic, but first we pause for our first "Photo Friday".

Our friend Debbie at [Delicious Baby](http://www.deliciousbaby.com/) has started a "Photo Friday" collection of bloggers and invited us to join in. We are pleasedÂ  to have the time to participate with some other cool bloggers. So far I see [SheilaS,](http://www.familytravellogue.com/photo-of-the-week-colmar-france.html) (who has just revamped her Family Travel site), [Heather,](http://heatheronhertravels.blogspot.com/2008/08/photo-friday-on-beach-in-sardinia.html) [Michelle from Wanderlust and Lipstick](http://wanderlustandlipstick.com/blogs/wandermom/2008/08/29/the-beary-big-firefighter/) (that recently interviewed us for her new book), [Caitlin](http://www.roamingtales.com/2008/08/29/photo-friday-birds-eye-view-of-bordeaux/) and [Gogugo](http://gogugo.blogspot.com/2008/08/alaska-for-photo-friday.html) there.

This is a photo of Mozart taken on top of an awesome mountain top on a drive between Santiago and the shore.The view was absolutely spell binding and there were wild horse nearby grazing freely. Mozart jumped out of the RV and started doing an enthusiastic dance in the wind, near some wind turbines. I clicked and was pleasantly surprised by the results. It was an unworldly moment, all to ourselves and this caught the energy!

Do you love expensive goat cheese? Did you know you can easily and cheaply make your own healthier goat cheese from [goat milk kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "goat milk kefir")?  
  
Since I have been on my [health journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "health journey") while [traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html#more "traveling when sick"), I've learned a ton about [healthy organic food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy organic raw food") and [how to eat for heatlh](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "how to eat for health"). Kefir is an amazing [superfood](http://chriskresser.com/kefir-the-not-quite-paleo-superfood "kefir super food") recommended by many doctors and health experts and it is best to make your own from grains and raw milk for the highest quality.

**KEFIR IS A SUPERFOOD**  
  
"Discover the incredible health-promoting benefits of kefir. If you are serious about boosting your immunity and increasing your daily energy, then adding traditionally fermented foods to your diet is a must. Although not widely known, the health benefits of these foods are tremendous While both Kefir and yogurt are cultured milk products, they contain different types of beneficial bacteria. Yogurt contains transient beneficial bacteria that keep your digestive system clean and provide food for the friendly bacteria that already are present. Kefir actually helps to colonize your intestinal tract -- a feat that yogurt cannot match." Mercola D.O  
  
"A study published in the Journal of Medicinal Foods in 2007 showed that kefir extracts have components that specifically target and stop the growth of human breast cancer cells." Kristie Leong M.D.

**"The various types of beneficial microbiota contained in kefir make it one of the most potent probiotic foods available.** Besides containing highly beneficial bacteria and yeasts, kefir is a rich source of many different vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids that promote healing and repair, as well as general health maintenance. [](http://ecosmesi.it/pdf/Kefir-%20A%20Probiotic%20Dairy-Composition,%20Nutritional%20and%20Therapeutic%20Aspects.pdf)Kefir contains high levels of thiamin, B12, calcium, folates and Vitamin K2. It is a good source of biotin, a B vitamin that HELPS the body assimilate other B vitamins. The complete proteins in kefir are already partially digested, and are therefore more easily utilized by the body. Kefir is a great source of vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and a variety of other unique compounds that can greatly contribute to your overall health and wellbeing. I highly recommend including this nutritious superfood in your diet"  Chris Kresser L.AC  
  
"Kefir digests yeast cells and has a beneficial affect on the intestinal flora".Dr. Orla-Jenson, a noted Danish bacteriologist

"When you drink kefir, the flora goes right to work for you. These mini soldiers help re-colonize the good flora in your gut. They also get rid of harmful organisms, like too much H. Pylori, the bacteria that cause ulcers. Kefir grains also seem to have the unique ability to unlock peptides from milk.1 In regular milk, these peptides stay hidden, or _encrypted_. But when you ferment the milk with kefir grains, it unlocks these peptides to give you benefits including:  
  
\* Lower blood pressure  
\* Increased immune strength  
\* Normal cholesterol function  
\* Improved protein digestion

And despite the fact that kefir is made from milk, most people who are lactose intolerant can drink kefir easily."  Dr. Sears M.D.  
  
  
"I think kefir is great. It is a probiotic, which means it contains "friendly" bacteria that can stabilize the digestive tract, and when it is well made, it is delicious. Kefir also provides you with calcium and protein, and may have some additional benefits for the immune system. You can certainly use it every day. A small study published in the May, 2003, _Journal of the American Dietetic Association_ showed that drinking kefir eliminated - or, at least, dramatically reduced - symptoms of lactose intolerance." Dr. Weil M.D.

**KEFIR HEALTH BENEFITS**  
  
I've found kefir to be one of the best things in our healthful eating and we all eat it daily. I am especially thrilled that I now have a great source for raw goats milk which makes the best kefir and is so delicious. We also make coconut kefir and sometimes make a mix of raw goats milk and coconut milk, but I have yet to try making cheese with that.  
  
Many say kefir is a natural remedy for any allergy, the strongest antibiotic and helpful in healing exzema, liver disease, gastritis, colon cancer, IBS, arthritis, colitis, AHDH, asthma, bronchitis, hepatitis, leaky gut, kidney stones, cavities and more. There is so much information about the benefits that I will have to write a post just on that.  
  
We all need more probiotics to stay healthy in our toxic world and the best man-made probiotic contain about 15 billion organisms, while home made kefir tops that easily with one cup containing 5 trillion beneficial organisms.

**HOW TO MAKE GOATS MILK KEFIR ( LEBAN) CHEESE**  
  
Making this goat cheese is remarkably easy and so delicious. It is also sometimes called Quark or Lebneh.  
  
\* First, simply make your homemade Kefir as I explained in my post **[How to Make Kefir Easy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "how to make DIY homemade kefir").**  
  
\* Then place a your clean strainer ( that you used to separate the kefir from the grains) over a bowl.  
  
\* Place two cheese cloths over the strainer ( some use a dish towel). I could find cheese cloth in Asia, so used something similar and it works great.  
  
\* Pour your kefir into the strainer with cloths and fill to the top.  
  
\* Let sit for a few hours.  
  
\* Then "tie up" the ends of the cloth by using a rubber band to make a little bag=like thing.  
  
\* Slide a spoon through the rubber band.  
  
\* Place that over a mason jar.  
  
\* Check 12 to 24 hours later to get the taste and texture that works for you. ( Takes longer in cool temperatures and depends on tastes preferences).  
  
\* In the bowl and jar there will be whey that has dripped from the cloth. Save this to use for other fermented foods like [lacto-fermented sals](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-salsa.html "lacto fermented salsa")a or [chutney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-mango-papaya-chutney.html "fermented chutney") or to soak grains etc.

That's it! Put it in a jar and store in the refrigerator. I've read that it lasts months, but it is so good that it doesn't last too long in our home. You can add flavorings too like honey and walnuts or garlic and herbs, but plain is wonderful too and enjoyed by each of us atop a slice of freshly made sourdough bread.  
  
Any questions? Have you made this goats milk cheese before?

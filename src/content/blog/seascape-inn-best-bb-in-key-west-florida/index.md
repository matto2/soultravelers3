We started our [Florida roadtrip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "Florida road trip") with a few days in [beautiful Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/-beach-bliss-romantic-dining-fantasy-in-key-west.html "beautiful key west") and stayed at the historic [Seascape Tropical Inn Bed and Breakfast](http://www.seascapetropicalinn.com/ "seascape tropical inn bed and breakfast in Key West"). This vacation getaway gem was called "Sparkling" by the New York Times and "Best value of all Key West Bed and Breakfasts" by Florida Keys Magazine.

This charming Bahamian Conch-style treasure was built in 1840 and has a perfect quiet location near  Duval street just steps away from the Hemingway House and an easy walk or bike ride  to all the shops, restaurants, beaches and bars.  
  
We adored all of it including this relaxing hot tub and pool. Mozart loved the resident cat. They actually usually don't accept kids, but gave us special permission since Mozart is a pretty sophisticated tween older than her years.

We stayed in the large Front Porch Room with it's historic Dade County pine walls and tropical furnishings, we felt embraced by the enchantments of Key West reminiscent of yesteryear. As someone who loves Key West ,but hadn't been here in over 30 years, this was just what I wanted.

So much has changed in Key West, I hardly recognized it, but thankfully, Old Town and this little piece of heaven, made me feel at home and proud to show the authentic Key West delights to my family.

We had changed our itinerary at the last moment when we found out the famous Poker Run with 10, 000 motorcyclist were coming the weekend we had planned to be there. Uh, oh.  It is a fantastic event, but not what we wanted to experience fresh from Europe with jetlag.  
  
 I want to thank Marcia and Dave, along with thier assistant Lynn who hosted us and sponsored our stay with a last second notice. We came early, direct from [Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "Barcelona"),  so just saw all the motorcycles as we were leaving, headed back to [Miami](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/south-beach-miami-vacation-photo.html "Miami vacation") and enjoyed a peaceful, quiet visit during the week.

They made us feel very welcomed after the long drive from the airport in [Miam](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/south-beach-miami-at-night.html "Miami at night south beach")i and the attention to detail made one feel instantly at home. It's the perfect location like an oasis on a quiet street, but close to all the action.  
  
![Key West - gorgeous tropical beach](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c36a755d8970b.jpg)  
  
Breakfast was yummy with fresh delivered bagels and bake goods, yogurt, mimosas and more.

One can relax and hang out in the sun working on that perfect tan,

or head out for some exploring like the famous [Key West Sunset](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/world-famous-key-west-sunset.html "key west sunset") or trying their [famous Pink Shrimp](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/famous-key-west-pink-shrimp.html "famous key west pink shrimp") or Key Lime Pie. Mallory square has changed a lot since I use go their regularly in my childhood and twenties, but the sunset is still lovely as a Jimmy Buffett song.

I was dealing with [traveling while sick](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "traveling while sick or medical challenges or mobility challenges"), so was really grateful for the spa that I used both morning and night to heal my weary bones and still remember the magical moonlight, stars and stillness of the night soak.

Are you planning an [around-the-world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world trip planning") or extended travel as a family, couple or solo traveler? We got lots of [advice](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/best-packing-tip-for-world-travel.html "best packing tip for world travel") before we left on our [open ended family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html " family world trip - open ended") seven years ago, but the [best advice](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/advice-to-college-grads-from-a-world-traveler.html "best advice for college grads") we got was to take more than a year.  
  
I talked to several people who had done [around-the-world trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/around-the-world-with-kids-extended-travel-long-term-travel-families-and-friends.html "around the world trip") and most took a year and every single one said it was just not long enough. Before [long term travel,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "long term travel tips") a year seems like a long time for a [perpetual vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "perpetual vacation"), but amazingly it zips by so fast and the world is big. [Slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") is essential if you don't want to experience t[ravel burn out](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/how-to-prevent-travel-burnout.html "travel burn out - how to avoid") and if keeping costs down is important to you.  
  
We [sold our home in 2005](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "sold our California home at peak in 2005") to start this [digital nomad travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomad travel lifestyle tips") and took a year to prepare including lots of small trips as we sold almost all of our belongings and [became minimalists](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "becoming minimalists").  Now there are many websites and books on this topic, but then there were almost none as tech wasn't quite there to make it as easy as it is today.  
  
Frankly, even seven years have zipped by. We didn't know our [around-the-world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "around the world trip") would be so long or that we'd go [round-the-world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "round the world") a few times and see many countries we had never expected to see or be on our list. 45 countries now on 5 continents since we began with many of them very deep explorations with many return trips to our "[homes' around the world.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "homes around the world") We just fell in love with the freedom of [our travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "our travel lifestyle") that allows us such a rich life on little.

 [](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "homes around the world")The more we travel, explore and see, the bigger we realize this planet is. [A RTW trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/around-the-world-family-travel/page/2/ "RTW trip tips") will change you and your world view, so my best advice, is to go slow, keep it open-ended, follow your heart, bliss and take as much time as you can to get to know this incredible planet, it's wonderful people and yourself.  
  
Before we began, we didn't know that this was all possible and had our share of [fears about travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/can-you-travel-with-fear-of-flying-vertigo-claustrophobia-and-agoraphobia.html#more "fears about travel"). If you are called to [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "reasons for a world trip") or ANY other dream, trust your heart, prepare well and make it happen!

**Choose Your Storage Location Wisely**

When it comes to storing an RV, you’ll want to find a good temporary home for it. Our advice is to talk to the people at the camping resorts as they usually know the best places nearby. Often times campers from the UK, Netherlands or Germany etc, may want to store their van, RV's and campers for the winter in Spain or Portugal. Finding a safe, covered, insured place, is the best way to store an RV as these storage locations create the ideal environment for RV storage. The best RV storage facilities provide indoor, climate-controlled units that help keep your vehicle away from direct sunlight, rain, snow, any pest damage and extreme outside temperatures.

 I also saw this site recommended, so you could look into it ( we have not yet). They do not have only facilities for RV, campers and motorhome storage, but you can use the search to see what is available and then check if they store bigger vehicles: [Park Via](https://www.parkvia.com/en)   
  
Have you ever stored your van, camper or RV? What was your experience like?

"One of the great things about travel is you find out how many good, kind people there are" ~Wharton  
  
I've written about the [kindness of strangers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/kindness-of-str.html "random acts of travel") before and how the [people](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/village-people.html " people and travel kindness") we've met on [our travels](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "travel ultimate family trip") have touched our hearts and given me even more faith in humanity. I am still amazed how kind and generous people are to strangers and travelers and often it feels quite surreal and magical.  
  
There are really just too many stories of great kindness on our [open ended world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "open ended world tour") to share them all, but this is a recent one that happened in [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "travel to China"). I don't have a photo of this particular angel, but the photo I am using was another stranger/angel we met, who was so happy to talk to Mozart [in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "how to learn mandarin in Asia") as we found ourselves serendipitously as the only non-Chinese at a large festival in Xian.  
  
 We met a most beautiful angel in [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/beijing-bikes-and-beauty.html "travel to Beijing")! We had taken a bus, crossed a large intersection and took a long subway ride to the home we were staying at our first evening, but got a little confused in the dark and thought we got off the wrong stop. ( Two had the same long Chinese name but one was south and one was north and we were not sure which one was ours).  
  
Mozart was spending her days and nights at the Mandarin school, so we are on our  
own in an all Mandarin world unable to speak any Mandarin except thank you, delicious, hello and goodbye.  
  
We asked a beautiful young girl if she spoke English and she said yes and took over...said follow me. She found us a cab, took us to the local home we are staying at, paid for the cab and refused to take our money.  
  
Despite having a card and key to get in and her to talk to the security card, they refused to let us in as the owner had not informed them that we were coming. She called the owner and explained the situation and then the owner explained it to the guard.  
  
The taxi left without her because it took so long in the cold, dark evening. She disappeared with out us getting her name or photo and the guard led us to our correct complex ( amongst many towers in the dark).  
  
This is the kind of blessed life we lead. [Traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling the world") lets one realize that there are angels every where. We found so very many in China! ♥ ( We did want to take her out to dinner and since our new friends had her phone number on their cell phones now, they invited her, but she lived very far away and was only in this neighborhood by accident, so we didn't see her again).  
  
Have you given or received any random acts of kindness?

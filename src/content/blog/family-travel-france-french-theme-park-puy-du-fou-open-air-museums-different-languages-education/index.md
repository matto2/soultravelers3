[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is about the little things and how they can [teach us about other languages and cultures](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html), often in subtle ways that are absorbed by children more than we realize. Just being in countries where everything is written in another language and everyone is talking in another language (and where theirs is the minority) is an enlightening experience. We loved [visiting Puy du Fou](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/family-travel-photofrance-puy-du-fou-theme-park-1.html) which is a spectacular and famous French theme park that should not be missed. [Puy du Fou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puy_du_Fou) has outstanding shows that also teach about history in a very entertaining way for kids and everyone in the family and I will be writing more on this topic soon.  
  
But it is also quite beautiful and has several villages with craftsman working in traditional ways in costumes from other eras, that you can observe. The many outdoor [open air museums like this in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/open-air-museum.html) are tremendous for kids and families. In France we prefer to go to these kinds of places where most are French families.  We loved it and think [Disney](http://disney.go.com/index) could learn a lot from the French on how to do a theme park that is more authentic and educational.

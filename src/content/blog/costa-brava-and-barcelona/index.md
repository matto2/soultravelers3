Barcelona is one of the most [popular destinations in Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Brava "popular destination in europe"), but sadly most tourists miss near by [Costa Brava and the amazing secret gems](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/top-10-costa-brava-secret-gems-spain.html "costa brava amazing secret gems") there. Our very [first stop in Spain was Costa Brava](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/espana-costa-br.html "first stpp in spain costa brava") when we began our [family world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world trip") in 2006.   
  
We have been back many times to this [wild coast](http://en.costabrava.org/main/home.aspx "wild coast in spain") as we love the [Coasta Brava Catalan beaches,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/-family-travel-spain-costa-brava-photo-family-friendly-beaches-europe.html "costa brava catalan beaches") the rugged coastal mountains that prevents over building, enchanting villages, [Dali Museums](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/dali-musee-hot.html "Dali museums") and more. We are so grateful to be back in Spain and having the luxury to enjoy it this June and July.   
  
One of the magnificent wonders of Spain are it's [Paradores](http://www.parador.es/en/portal.do "Paradores in Spain") which are hotels and luxury accommodations in Castles, Palaces, Convents, Monasteries and maintained by the government. This photo was taken at the [Parador de Aiguablava](http://www.parador.es/en/tratarFichaParadorCabecera.do?parador=001 "parador aiguablava in costa brava") near Berger where we came just as a day trip to enjoy the spectacular Costa Brava views and have a yummy lunch.   
  
Have you been to Costa Brava yet? Is it on your list?

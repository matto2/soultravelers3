April 20, 2008

This is the view that I see out my kitchen  
and living room window and it never fails  
to make me smile.

This is the view that I see out my kitchen and living room window and it never fails to make me smile. There are shutters on the windows and I love opening them in the morning and opening up the doors to let the sunshine in, then I walk to the front terrace and breathe in this fabulous view as I stretch a little and greet the day. I read somewhere that it is good to stretch and get into sunlight when you wake up and this is certainly the place to do that.

The birds chirp, the roosters crow and I often hear goats bleat and horse hooves clomp by. I think I should do a short video of my walk to pick up Mozart from school as I love taking in the "campo" or countryside as I rush to retrieve her or more slowly return. I saw a simple moment like that on someone's vlog and thought the school walk might be a fun one for us. One of those simple pleasures in daily life.

Spring in Spain is more like early summer and I suppose winter is closer to a normal spring. Mozart was already swimming in our pool here in March. I love the sunshine, longer days and watching the gardens grow and leaves bud out.

This is just a quick post to try out a few things. I need to claim this blog for Technorati. Don't ask me, as I have no idea what that means, but they say it is a good thing, so I am trying to follow it through. I also forgot to thank our webmaster in my last post and he has been our hero behind the scenes. Thanks so very much to Michael at [Setup Systems](http://www.setupsystems.com/) who helped us make the revamp happen! He is in Santa Cruz, so we ended up doing a lot of it over Skype.

Because of [twitter](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3), I found this inspiring video that I want to share with you. I like this man's enthusiasm about celebrating what is right with the world! He was a photographer for National Geographic and there are some great images too. So in this season of new beginnings, lets take time to breathe in and appreciate all that is right in this world and celebrate this gift of life!

I guess I am on a video kick, now that it is easier to do with this new revamped system, so you might also want to take a look at the education page where I put a few cool videos up. I have lots to share on that page, but these will give you some food for thought hopefully, while you wait.

I will end with Mozart on the balcony looking out into the campo from our little sugar cube town in Andalusia on a warm spring day.

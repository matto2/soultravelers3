[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "Family travel") to French Polynesia can be done on a very low budget and we are loving our experience here in Moorea where we are couch surfing with some wonderful people. She is a speech therapist from France and he is Polynesian who was born here, but lived a year in Spain many years ago. You can see their homes's spectacular view of Cooks Bay and more photos on our [Soultravelers3 Facebook Page.](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187?v=photos&ref=mf#!/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187 "soultravelers3 facebook page")  

This is our 10 year old playing and swimming at the gorgeous Opunoha Bay public beach yesterday. The weather can change quickly here from sun to rain and back to sun. The clouds and moutains add mystery and it is still amazingly undeveloped here.

We head to Bora Bora where we will spend Halloween ( they do celebrate it here, but not door to door)  and beyond and will be writing in depth about our travels here with many more photos once we slow down. We loved the Polynesian island feel of [Kauai](Kauai "http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html") recently and continuing that theme here. Many beautiful stories and photos to come. Happy Friday, happy weekend all!

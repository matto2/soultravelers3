Ahhh, it is good to have time to rest and relax and this seems to be the perfect place to recover from our fast travel and catch our breath a little. I thought we would need any where from three days to ten days, but it seems we might need more. We have a few things to take care of like the blog and the satellite, but mostly we just need time to be. This haven will be a hard place to leave.

We have been going at a pretty intense pace for us with the Morocco trip that closely followed our Three Generations Tour of Spain with family and all the work of transitioning from village to road. It was all worth it and fun, but now we need a rest. One of the great things about our kind of travel is we can make  
it up as we go, and this place just calls for more at this point in time.

What a wonderful campsite resort this is outside of Barcelona on a beautiful beach! It is one of our favorites so far in Europe. The weather is great but it is still considered off season so we have great winter rates and the longer we stay the cheaper it is. We are paying less than 18 euros a day to live like royalty. Once again, I say that without a doubt, Europeans really know how to “camp”!

There are three wonderful, huge pools here including a very luxurious indoor one, plus jacuzzi, sauna, kids shows, disco, great Catalan restaurant, bar, zoo, laundry service, take out food, basketball & sports courts, workout room, massages, arcade, tours, wifi in our motorhome and more. It has everything but the hotel and is on the beautiful grounds of an old Catalan farm.

They have bike, scooter and car rentals but we have our own bikes now, so only used the car rental once for a run to buy a battery. We are a quick train ride away from Barcelona in an area full of vineyards and lovely beaches. Riding the bus to the nearby small town gives us a real feel for the local people and our camping neighbors are from around the world.

The staff here goes out of their way to be helpful and there is even a caravan store nearby with helpful people that have assisted us at no charge. Contact us at soultravelers3@hotmail.com if you are a camper interested in the exact name of this place. I am not sure what the cottages and bungalows go for but it is a great spot for families and retirees visiting this area on a budget.

I thought this would be a good choice and we would need it at this point, but it is ever better than we expected. It does not have the marble baths of the one we stayed at in Spain on the way down last fall, but it has other advantages. It is a very big place so we are getting lots of use of our bikes. It is mostly really quiet here, although it does perk up on weekends with the locals come here for  
some R&R.

This places is much bigger than our whole village in Andalusia so I am glad I am not here in high season when it must be packed. I could live without the week end disco music until midnight, but I am sure it is a highlight for the teens and gives them something to do. They have a great light-show fountain nearby which makes the restaurant and disco area very inviting. There is a very different feel here between the quiet week days and hopping week ends.

We have a few favorites things here. I love the croissants which are the best I have had in Europe (including France). I also love their laundry service which is fantastic and much cheaper than other places we have been to just for use of the machines. You drop it off and pick it up the next day and it is all clean and folded. It looks like they even ironed some things and they did a great job. I was thrilled.

I also adore the waterfall in the jacuzzi. It is from way up high and falls all the way down and it is like getting a heavenly massage to sit under it. DaVinci and I take turns moving our backs, shoulders and necks into ideal positions lapping up the healing salt water. They do have massage here for a reasonable price as well, but I am not sure if it could get much better than this amazing fountain. They also have three smaller spray things in the indoor pool that massages shoulders. I can see why they attract some snow birds for the winter and we have met some great people here.

Mozart and DaVinci love the bakery here and the desserts (they are really much too good and tempting). Mozart likes to get the hot chocolate when ever she goes with one of us to the reception. We all love the whole roasted chicken which is at least a healthy choice and that and a salad has got us spoiled by even skipping some cooking duties. Mozart loves all the bells and whistles, but she also just enjoys riding her bike and playing in dirt. We are glad to have the time to home school again and catch up on piano practice. We could not have asked for a better resting place!

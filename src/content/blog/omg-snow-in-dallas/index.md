 I know there have been some amazing snow storms this year from [Atlanta](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/28/weather-deep-south-ice-storm-snow-houston-louisiana/4957279/ "atlanta snow") to [Portland](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/rare-snowstorm-hammers-western-oregon "snow in Portland") and regularly through the Midwest and East Coast, but it was a shock to wake up to snow in Dallas for my child who has never lived in a place where it snowed.  
  
She was ecstatic! She may be the [world's most well-traveled child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "most well traveled child"), but she has been living mostly in [tropical weathe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical winter in southeast Asia")r lately to become [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent mandarin") and before that she was usually in a Mediterranean   climate like [Andalusia, Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "how to winter in spain") or [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California beach town") or winter travel to [Bora Bora](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora travel cheap"), [Hawaii](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/family-travel-hawaii-learning-to-surf-in-kauai.html "Hawaii family travel learn to surf"), or [Sydney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/the-stunning-sydney-harbour-yha-hostel-review.html "Sydney cheap hostel").

Of course, she had to run right out and make a snowball! This is the view from our window in our new home-away-from-home, the amazing [Hawthorn Suites in Addison](http://www.hawthorn.com/hotels/texas/addison/hawthorn-suites-by-wyndham-addison-galleria/hotel-overview "Hawthorn Suites Addison"), which is the best extended stay hotel in Dallas. ( I will be writing more on this topic soon).  
  
Yes, she has [skied in southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/skiing-in-southern-spain.html "ski southern spain in Granada") and [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "california best destinations") and froze at the [Great Wall in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/the-great-wall-of-china.html "great wall china") in December, but she has never been any where that she could wake up to new snow that she remembers. It did barely snow once at our old [home in California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "beautiful california home") and our [winter home in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/family-travel-photo-spain-.html "snow in andalusia"), but never like this.

Always new experiences to embrace! Luckily temps are suppose to get back up to 70 here next week, and today was sunny and warm, everything melted........ so that pleases her parents who are [retired](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/retire-and-travel-the-world.html "retire and travel") and like to avoid too much cold and snow.

Are you enjoying the snow where you are or not so much?

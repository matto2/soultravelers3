[Heavenly](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com "Heavenly Reyna singer songwriter actress") has been going viral on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/heavenlyreyna "Heavenly Reyna on Twitch going viral") with over 2 million channel views and with global audience of 300 - 10k people every stream 5 x a week. Her wonderful Twitch family wanted her to release "Exit" their favorite song, so she is releasing this acoustic version first and an acoustic YouTube video with it. Her lyrics are amazing along with her voice! Look for a great premiere and party on Twitch on July 21st 8pm - 12 PDT.

Truly mind-blowing & inspiring to see her do all of this from her tiny bedroom recording  studio & reach the world! I admire how she took the very hard challenges of the pandemic and found new ways to share her gifts with the world. So many on Twitch say how her music and voice uplifts them, so a good lesson for us all!

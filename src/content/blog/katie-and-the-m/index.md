Katie and the Mona Lisa  
Mozart loves this whole series. We got them when she  
was quite young,but she still loves them at seven and  
rereads them all over and over. Charming stories,  
exuberant illustrations and a fun approach to art  
education for a young child. When she sees these  
paintings in real life in museums as we travel,  
she feels like they belong to her.

As we've [traveled the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "family travel the world") non-stop these past 7-plus years, we've seem some amazing festivals around the world from famous [Semana Santa in Seville](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/semana-santa-in.html "semana santa seville") and [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html "semana santa andalusia"), women [riding wild horses in Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html "wild horses in Provence"), Diwali,[3 KIngs/Los Reyes Magos](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/3-kings-in-spain-andalusia-festival-tradition-white-village-christmas-epiphany-12th-night.html "3 kings festival spain los reyes magos"), Ramadan, [Carnival](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/worlds-best-carnival-celebration-spain-photos-kids-family-travel-fun-adventure-lent-in-andalusia.html "Carnival - best in the world!"), spectacular [Horse Fair](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/joys-of-the-roa.html "Jerez Horse Fair"),  [Halloween](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html "halloween"),  [Chinese New Year](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Chinese New Year") in Asia, [Eid ul-Fitr](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/ramadan-ends-eid-ul-fitr-festival-begins.html "eidu ul-fitr and Ramadan photos"), [Christmas abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "christmas abroad tips") and many more.

We were all quite blown away by the surreal, colorful, exotic festival of [Thaipusam](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/thaipusam-2013.html "Thaipusam") in Malaysia which was like taking a [trip to India](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/india-tourist-visa-nightmare-problems-from-se-asia.html "india visa nightmare") and deeply exploring the Hindu culture. I hope you enjoy these stunning photos and there are more coming!  
  
[![Indian folk Dancing at this world festival](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371ed9ba970b.jpg "Indian folk Dancing at this world festival")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371ed9ba970b.jpg)  
  
We have been here before during Thaipusam, but I had seen photos of the extremely painful looking piercings and I am so empathetic, I didn't think we could go as it also didn't seem like family friendly entertainment and I was hesitant to infringe.  
  
[![Thaipusam festival hooks pierced into back pulling large alter in trance](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e2be4970c.jpg "Thaipusam festival hooks pierced into back pulling large alter in trance")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e2be4970c.jpg)  
  
I was wrong though and I am really glad we experienced this amazing, three day festival which is one of the biggest ( and most bizarre) in Asia.  
  
[![tranced out Thaipusam devotee with piercings in mouth, face and back](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8c201b0970d.jpg "tranced out Thaipusam devotee with piercings in mouth, face and back")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8c201b0970d.jpg)  
  
The piercing photos grab the attention of most travel bloggers or photographers that go, and that certainly is fascinating, but the festival is so much more and watching the devotees in a deep trance with the piercings is actually easier in person than via photos.  
  
I didn't want to intrude on their sacred ceremony rituals, but they seem to actually enjoy photographers.  
  
[![colorful festival food in huge pots](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e2fbb970c.jpg "colorful festival food in huge pots")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e2fbb970c.jpg)  
  
The bountiful, spicy, free food alone, all along the sacred long procession road is amazing, not to mention the colorful saris and Indian clothes.   How many pots this size have you seen?  
  
[![festival offering devotional basket](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e542e970c.jpg "festival offering devotional basket")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e542e970c.jpg)

 The devotion shown in so many ways like all of these offering baskets of simple, pretty, natural things, given with sacred symbolic meaning and love, was touching even to an outsider. 

[![colorful folk dancing group at festival](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371eeb94970b.jpg "colorful folk dancing group at festival")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371eeb94970b.jpg)  
  
The costumes and dancing and excitement of young people and families was heart-warming.  
  
[![colorful celebrants at festival](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8c2166a970d.jpg "colorful celebrants at festival")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8c2166a970d.jpg)  
  
So much color and so many people!  
  
[![Colorful Indian festival](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f0029970b.jpg "Colorful Indian festival")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f0029970b.jpg)  
  
We learned more about the Tamil community, the God Murugan,  and devotees carrying Kavadi ( burdens) that look like alters ( or the spears and hooks).  
  
[![Hindu Thaipusam Kavadi devotee](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e554b970c.jpg "Hindu Thaipusam Kavadi devotee")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e554b970c.jpg)  
  
We enjoyed the music, rhythmic drumming with sticks and folk dancing.  
  
  
[![folk dancing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f014a970b.jpg "folk dancing")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f014a970b.jpg)  
  
Food, glorious, food and how the community worked so well together.  
  
  
[![colorful festival clothes and food line](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e441c970c.jpg "colorful festival clothes and food line")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e441c970c.jpg)  
  
Perhaps the most touching, was how much love and caring was given to support those that were in a trance and carried heavy burdens in the heat on the long walk/procession  between temples.  
  
[![Thaipusam devotee being helped by friends in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e570a970c.jpg "Thaipusam devotee being helped by friends in Penang")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e570a970c.jpg)  
  
Seeing whole families, young and old participating in this 10 hour journey between temples.  
  
[![father and son Thaipusam hooks and piercing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e58b7970c.jpg "father and son Thaipusam hooks and piercing")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e58b7970c.jpg)  
  
The joy, jewelry, sparkles and color.  
  
[![Indian girl face in traditional festival make up and jewels](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e57b9970c.jpg "Indian girl face in traditional festival make up and jewels")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e57b9970c.jpg)  
  
Shaved heads of men, women and young children covered in sandalwood paste as a symbol of humility.  
  
[![Thaipusam shaved heads](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e5992970c.jpg "Thaipusam shaved heads")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e5992970c.jpg)  
  
Endless photo opportunities and multicolored creativity.  
  
[![colorful horse folk dancer](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8c22e27970d.jpg "colorful horse folk dancer")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8c22e27970d.jpg)  
  
Soooo many coconuts on the street as the custom is to break one for good luck. Smashing them symbolizes breaking the ego and revealing the purity inside.  
  
[![Thaipusam coconuts on street](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f1e98970b.jpg "Thaipusam coconuts on street")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f1e98970b.jpg)  
  
We have a few Indian Malaysian friends here and our daughter enjoys an Indian teacher in her [Mandarin school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "mandarin school") who she was looking for during this festival, but we had never seen so much of the Indian community together like this as we know mostly [Chinese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/the-beauty-of-traditional-chinese-culture.html "chinese culture") in Penang.  
  
[![Indians with offerings at the temple](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f1f95970b.jpg "Indians with offerings at the temple")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f1f95970b.jpg)  
  
Even these young boys were carrying their Kavadi.  
  
[![young boys with Kavadi](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8c238aa970d.jpg "young boys with Kavadi")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8c238aa970d.jpg)  
  
The silver chariot here and the long procession reminded me some of the elaborate festivals in Spain like Semana Santa.  
  
  
[![Thaipusam Penang with silver chariot and offerings](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f2063970b.jpg "Thaipusam Penang with silver chariot and offerings")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c371f2063970b.jpg)  
  
Yes, indeed.  
  
[![Mozart and I enjoying the festival madness in the hot sun](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e65f2970c.jpg "Mozart and I enjoying the festival madness in the hot sun")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e65f2970c.jpg)  
  
We were very honored to be part of the Thaipusam festival this year and found it to be family friendly with many fantastic [world schoo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school")l opportunities for Mozart to learn more about this culture and religion first hand.  
  
[![families enjoying Thaipusam](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e66d0970c.jpg "families enjoying Thaipusam")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d414e66d0970c.jpg)  
  
Like China, India is rising, so an important culture to know more about. Thaipusam in Penang ( and the throngs of people here and in KL participating) lets one know just how many Indian Malaysians are here and how connected the community is.  
  
"A nations's culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people." Gandhi

“It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them.” -Leo F. Buscaglia  
  
I think that [play](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/hanging-out-roa.html) and [being in nature](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/family-travel-photohappy-earth-day.html) is so important in [travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/the-ultimate-travel-photo.html "ultimate travel photo") or any life. One of the advantages of [worldschooling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html/ "worldschooling or unschooling") on our [RTW trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "rtw trip") is that we have LOTS of time for play.  
  
Out of the 65 videos we have on our [Soultravelers3 Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 youtube channel")  ( with close to 4 million views!), this is one of Mozart's favorites.( Please join us there by the way, if you haven't already).  
  
I think it shows one of the keys to [slow travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel benefits- why do it") and [learning while traveling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/learning-while-traveling-travel-homeschool-road-school-abroad-5-best-reasons.html "learning while traveling")\- it is crucial to take time to play because [family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/family-travel-photo/ "family travel tips") is often about doing ordinary things in extraordinary places.  
  
Before and after we toured lovely [Ljublijana, Slovenia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/10/lovely-ljublija.html "ljublijana, slovenia travel"), we had to allow for time to play and now so happy we captured this fun moment. I am sure "fancy town" was inspired by the architecture we were seeing.

She is always creating something, like the rag doll above or these windows made out of a glue system she made up and some tooth picks for a log house she was making. She hums or sings away as she makes things and we are happy to live in our [real food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "real food and getting healthy") and [unplugged world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "unplugged world - best luxury") a lot.

I love it that she keeps expanding on her worlds no matter where we are. I see her growing skills that will help her in her writing, creativity, problem solving etc. and I sometimes wonder if she will be an architect, civil engineer or urban planner. Her cities are detailed, creative and awesome....it keeps exploding around her room as she is great at [making something out of nothing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/kid-friendly-travel-perks.html "making something out of nothing").

“The true object of all human life is play.” -G. K. Chesterton  
  
My sister gave her some knitting needles before we left [California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "california best destinations") and now she is a bit obsessed with knitting. She made herself some wrist bands for her volley ball class and all kinds of [fashion outfits](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "how to be a world traveling fashionista"). Sewing clothes, knitting, making belts and accessories and making all kinds of  things in this way is a passion at the moment. I don't know how to knit, so this is all self taught.

She has always known how to entertain herself, but we are a playful family, so do things together as well. She loves going down to the pool together as the whole family.  
  
Last Sunday we were in the pool for almost 3 hours and the last one was just the two of us. I love it that  she is still a child, but blossoming into a women now at 12, so I am cherishing every moment of these sweet pleasures. The pattern in [Malaysia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "how to find a winter rental apartment in Penang, Malaysia") is if you go at dinner time, you will see lots of kids to play with, but if we go earlier, we have the whole pool to ourselves.

As we hugged and waltzed [around the pool](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/08/cinque-terra-gem-best-budget-lodging-italy-for-family-vacation.html "cinque terra lodging with family") surrounded by palm trees and [tropical flowers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/04/spring-fever-tropical-flowers-in-asia.html "tropical flowers"), she told me the detailed plots of her current [favorite book](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family and books")s and why she loved them. Then she shared a magical, private,  made-up game with me that involved a blue tile she had found in the pool. After she skips it across the pool, one puts their head under the water and listens for an enchanting tingle as it gracefully hits the bottom of the pool.  
  
Sacred family times and sacred family travel moments come in many forms. I don't want to forget ANY of them.

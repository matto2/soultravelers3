 Are you a die-hard Harry Potter fan and star struck muggle? Have you or your child read every book repeatedly and have seen all the movies umpteen times? Then you will love the [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel around the world how-to") opportunities that involve both!  
  
**HARRY POTTER'S WIZARDING WORLD**  
  
In the USA, don't miss [The Wizarding World of Harry Potter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-kids-review.html "the wizarding world of harry potter"), which we took our HP fan to for her 11th [birthday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "birthdays abroad with travel") this year in [Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "Florida roadtrip with kids") on our [round-the-world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "Around-the-world trip with family") and she wrote a great review.  
  
Obviously, the UK is the top spot for discovering Harry Potter locations while you travel. Our daughter Mozart read her first Harry Potter book at 4 and is a huge fan, having read them countless times now.  
  
She had a blast reading Harry Potter books all through the UK at seven. It was fun to see her reading while on one of those double decker red buses in [London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/camping-in-london-best-low-budget-travel.html "camping London"), on a punt in Cambridge and waiting for a [Shakespeare play](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html "Shakespeare at the Globe theatre London") in [Stratford upon Avon](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/swimming-with-swans-stratforduponavon-england-uk.html "stratford upon Avon travel"). (We had an agreement that she read the books before seeing the films, but now she repeats both regularly in Spanish and English and knows them by heart).

We enjoyed visiting sites that are in the book and films all over the UK at seven and our many other trips to [Great Britain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/travel-kids-london-hamleys-toy-store.html "London with kids") on [our world tour.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "Our world tour") Our favorite was at Hogwarts!  
  
**HOGWARTS AND FLYING ON A BROOM STICK**  
  
Actually it was Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, UK but many of the exterior scenes were filmed there including where Harry first learned to fly. ( Also the Quidditch scenes, flying car crash, Hogwart's library and more!)  
  
It is very beautiful and was a lot of fun for Mozart and all of us. We decided to let her buy her [Halloween](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html "Halloween best") costume there ( Hermione Granger) and one of the cool brooms in the gift shop. That made her day!  
  
She was thrilled when a little British boy called her Hermione Granger and loved "flying" with Harry Potter and the gang...a memory she will never forget.  What more could a kid who is a major Harry Potter fanatic  want?

"Wine is constant proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy" Benjamin Franklin  
  
We have been exposing our daughter Mozart to vineyards and wine tasting from around the world since she was a few months old and she has loved it at every age. Here she is running through [our Pinot Noir vineyard](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "our pinot noir vineyard") at two on a sunny spring day. Just like [organic gardening](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/travel-organic-garden-homeschool-green-unschool-nature-unit-study-lessons-from-gardening-travel-.html "organic gardening") and [picking fruit in orchards](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/free-travel-food-helps-a-cheap-budget-family-travel-international-travel-tips.html "picking fruit in orchards"), we value learning about nature up close and personal.

This video we took of our [family wine vacation in Bordeaux, France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/biking-st-emilion-bordeaux-vineyards-in-france-wine-country.html "family wine vacation in Bordeaux, France") gives you some idea of the fun that one can have together as a family. Biking through beautiful French Vineyards, swimming, tasting in caves, eating in charming French locations, countryside picnics, meeting French kids that live on vineyards, learning about science through wine making  are just a few of the perks that please parents and kids. Here is another video we took a different year on a [wine vacation in Alsace](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/01/route-des-vins-dalsace-france-at-grape-harvest.html "wine vacation in Alsace") at harvest time. It was also easy for us to stick to our $23 dollar a day per person budget in both places.

We parents are actually not big wine drinkers, but we love the soulful aesthetics of  beautiful vineyards that we have visited around the world. Here are a few:

Vineyards are perfect for running, caves are exciting to explore and most wine tasting rooms have juice for kids to drink in wine glasses while parents taste. Have you ever tried wine tasting wih kids?

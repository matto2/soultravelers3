Many people consider [papaya to be a super food](http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2009/05/super-food-papaya-vit-c-and-papain-rich.html "Papaya superfood") and Dr. Oz calls it the secret to longevity. Papayas are a rich source of antioxidants, phytonnutrients, vitamins, minerals and special digestive enzymes. They certainly have been helpful in my [healing journey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "healing journey") and are easy to find and VERY cheap here in [tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical Asia"). I even dry the seeds and use it as pepper.  
  
Others call delicious [mangos super food](http://www.voxxi.com/mango-superfood/ "super food"), as it's high in Vitamin C, A, E, potassium and iron. Since mangos originate in Southeast Asia, they are also plentiful and super cheap here.

Thus,  I was very happy to discover the [Nourishing Traditions](http://www.amazon.com/Nourishing-Traditions-Challenges-Politically-Dictocrats/dp/0967089735 "Nourishing traditions") fermented Papaya Chutney recipe and modified it a little. It's a really nice touch to curry dishes and my yummy homemade sour dough roti flat bread  ( the latter I discovered by accident in an attempt to make sour dough tortillas which also makes good healthy mini pizzas made with my kefir cheese).  
  
I must get more of these great recipes up, but they are time consuming to post, so give me time, plus I am still learning as I go and like to make things several times before blogging it. Great ideas for [better travel health](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "better travel health") and easy for [slow travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel ideas") as well as at home. Many of them start with [making kefir](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "making kefir") as that is where I easily get the whey and of course we use as much [organic food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "raw organic food") as possible.  
  
**RECIPE FOR LACTO-FERMENTED MANGO-PAPAYA CHUTNEY**  
  
3 cups of chopped papaya and mango ( combined)  
1/4 cup of chopped onion  
1/2 cup of lime juice ( or lemon)  
1 Tablespoon of fresh grated ginger  
1/4 cup fresh organic  chopped cilantro  
1 teaspoon of sea salt  
1/4 cup of chopped green or red pepper  
2 Tablespoons raw, unheated honey  
1/4 cup of [](http://anhourinthekitchen.com/cream-cheese-and-whey/)whey

Peel and cut up papaya like in the first photo ( do not use peels or seeds)  
Mixed all ingredients and "smoosh" a bit, using a wooden spoon ( like second photo)  
Place in a mason jar. Slightly pack the ingredients into the jar so that everything is covered with liquid. Add  water if necessary.  
Cover tightly and leave at room temperature for two days.  
Then, just put it in the fridge and it should keep for two months.  
  
The super scrumptious  lacto-fermented salsa I make is more popular with my child and husband, but I enjoy this one too. I will try to get the salsa one up soon.

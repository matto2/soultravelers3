to World School & Learn Mandarin?  
  
NO! You don't have to be Suri  
Cruise, be rich or pay $40,000- 
a-year school to learn Mandarin

NO! You don't have to be Suri Cruise, be rich or pay $40,000-a-year school to [learn Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "learn Mandarin") or [world school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world school")! Someone sent me the latest about Tom and Katie Cruise and how they are educating their daughter Suri and it made me smile.  
  
We've  gotten a [better world school education](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "better world school education around the world") these last 7 years immersing in [Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "American girl learning Mandarin in Asia") and [Spanish](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "best education in Spanish ") as we [travel the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "travel the world") on just $23/ day per person, despite being monolingual parents.  
  
I do like the goals of the school which says:  
  
"aimed at the children of the jetsetting elite 'The World School' enables pupils to follow their parents around the globe without being tied to school vacation schedules."  
  
  
Hey, we do that!  As I recently wrote about how we [homeschool our gifted child around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "How to homeschool around the world with gifted child")...44 countries on 5 continents so far. Let me reassure Katie and Tom...it's a good thing and smart choice. ;)  
  
BUT, let me inform you regular folks like us, ANY one can do this today and we are living proof. As Tim Ferris said about us ( we're case studies in his mega hit [4-Hour Workweek](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/the-4hour-workweek-review-by-world-traveling-family-rich-global-digital-lifestyle-design.html "4-Hour workweek review")); "You don't have to be rich to live a rich life."  
  
Do you think this school has been reading our blog?  
  
The article in the [MailOnline](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2209685/Suri-Cruise-learning-Mandarin-Chinese-new-40-000-year-school.html?ito=feeds-newsxml "mail online suri cruise world school") also  said:  
  
'She is in the program for the Lower School which focuses on Chinese, and this is a great foundation for her.'

According to the website, the prestigious New York school also has plans to open campuses in several cities across China, including Beijing and Shanghai, and also one in Hong Kong.

The strategy is to completely immerse students in the Chinese culture.

'Mastery of languages other than one’s own is a central feature of the Avenues mission,' the school's website reads.  
  

'The forces fueling this trend are social, economic, political, environmental and technological. It sparks curiosity and invites travel. It erodes stereotypes and fosters peace.

'It builds both self-confidence and self-knowledge. All are essential outcomes of an Avenues education.

'The language of instruction in all Avenues schools will be English. By graduation, all students will be expected to be fluent in a second world language, although some will push well beyond this requirement.  
  
'Instruction will begin in the early years when students have proven capacities for language learning, with exposure to Mandarin and Spanish in the Early Learning Center.'  
  
  
Hmmm, do you think we have started a trend?  
  
As I wrote in [Global Citizens = Spanish and Mandarin immersion](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "spanish and mandarin immersion") and H[ow and WHY to raise a Global Kid](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "how and why to raise a global kid") there are MANY compelling reasons to think differently with our 21st century kids in our fast changing world!

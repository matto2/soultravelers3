Who can resist an opportunity to dress up in traditional dress in a new country? I can't! What a joy to be able to fly [all over China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/beautiful-china.html "beauty all over china- travel") while [visiting the Forbidden City](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "visiting the forbidden city") in [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/yum-loving-the-food-in-beijing.html "Beijing"). Perfect for [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html#more "family world travel and homeschool").  
  
Sure it is touristy and corny, so I had to talk my beloveds into it, but it turned out to be a blast and a great way for a family or a kid to connect with this historic culture and make a happy memory. We were wandering deeply in the Forbidden City on our 2nd visit there with her [Mandarin school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "Mandarin school in China"), when we stumbled upon these people with costumes.  
  
I will write more and have some cool video to go with it, but couldn't resist sharing this photo with you. We laugh every time we see us flying over [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/life-in-china.html "life in china") in these costumes..it was a lot of fun!  
  
What do you think? Can you see our past-life karma in China showing through?

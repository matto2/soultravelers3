I love this baby, or rather yearling, being held tight by mama's hand to keep her from running away free and wild. It was taken in the 1950's and is one of my favorite photos of me as a baby because it shows how little I have really changed in basic nature. I am guessing my beloved Grandmother took the photo ( of her eldest child and first grandchildren) and my eyes shine with love and joy at her.  
  
It is actually a picture of my mom, two brothers and me ( barely a year apart) in front of my grandparents home in Michigan, but I cut it tighter for this post. I love the little baby too, who was my "gentle giant" 6'7'  baby brother who died at 40. 
  
I don't usually talk about my birthdays much online, but this was a big one. In March I turned 60 and I must admit I haven't dreaded a birthday like this since 30. Some how both of these milestones, seemed a bit distasteful to me, yet all the rest of my birthdays were perfectly accepted. I think some how they both signified getting old to me and I am such a  young-at-heart free spirit, I don't really like that idea, but then again it is better than the alternative.  
  
  
"A man's age is something impressive, it sums up his life: maturity reached slowly and against many obstacles, illnesses cured, griefs and despairs overcome, and unconcious risks taken; maturity formed through so many desires, hopes, regrets, forgotten things, loves. A man's age represents a fine cargo of experiences and memories." Antoine de Saint-Exupery

How did this happen? Sixty? Really? I still naturally don't have any gray hair, I am not on any medication  and I feel as young as ever.  I am thinking that age is just a number and doesn't really matter.

It probably didn't help that I had been dealing with [travel health](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health") issues for some time as this birthday approached, but luckily [healthy eating](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy eating travel") and a few other things was turning that around. So by the time it arrived I was ready to accept it and rejoice in gratitude that I have had sixty wonderful years on this planet, have an amazing child that I get to spend tons of time with, a great husband, two living sweet parents, a dear sister and awesome friends around the world.

I am doing a daily mediation tape about healing from the inside out that I thoroughly enjoy and it has a special part that touches me each time that talks about reclaiming that full energy that we come in with to planet earth and this is the baby image of me that always comes to mind.  
  

Also, we got all of our baby videos of Mozart when we were home in California and put them all on DVD so we could bring them with us, so we've been really enjoying our abundant baby and toddler videos of Mozart. So fun to revisit that time period again and that wild and free baby and toddler energy.

I had a lovely birthday doing my favorite things with my favorite beloveds. I got a massage from my favorite masseuse in Asia, swam with my baby, went for a walk on the beach at sunset with my darling husband and we all had dinner at my favorite organic restaurant in Penang. Even splurged on a taxi. Perfect day for me!

 Alas, as this post waited in it's queue to go up, we got two blows this week. First an earthquake that shook our beautiful new home ( thankfully it was at a distance in Indonesia) and gave us a Tsunami warning. We recovered from that to get the very sad news that my Dad had been hospitalized in Texas and the doctors think he will live only a few days.  
  
All the more reason to embrace every moment of life full of gratitude and sieze the day.

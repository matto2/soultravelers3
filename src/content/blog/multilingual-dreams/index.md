What language do you dream in? _Pǔtōnghuà_ 普通话 or [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "mandarin ") is what my twelve year old [multilingual child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "how to raise multilingual child") was dreaming mostly on our recent [trip to Chin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "trip to china")a where she was in a [Mandarin School](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "mandarin school in China") to immerse more deeply. I took that as a good sign...that her mind was processing it day and night.  
  
Now that we are back to [Penang at her Chinese school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Penang chinese school for mandarin learning") here, she is back to dreaming in all three of her fluent languages, although [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "learning mandarin in Asia") is often dominant. She doesn't always remember her dreams in vivid detail, but she did the other day and we all enjoyed her funny trilingual dream.  
  
Most of it was in [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html#more "learning mandarin in Asia") and she was both singing and talking in it, but then some how she ended up at her [school in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "school in spain for learning spanish") and her friends there, so she started conversing with them in Spanish. Finally, at the end, she ran into us, so we all talked in English. Isn't [language learning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "language learning") fascinating?  
  
What do you dream? Do you enjoy discussing dreams on lazy mornings like we do?

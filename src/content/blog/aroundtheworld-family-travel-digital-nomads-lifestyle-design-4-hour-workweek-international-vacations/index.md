More and more [families are choosing international travel](http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/travel/04heads.html) and [around the world trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) perhaps inspired by the [new economy and many changes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html) in our world. Today, we begin a new category for random [round-the-world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) thoughts. Things like this cow or [ox crossing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-photo-spain-around-the-world-travel-ox-traditional-white-village-expat-lifestyle.html#more) sign on a main highway, let you know that you are no longer in Kansas. After [traveling the world non-stop since 2006](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html) on 4 continents, as a family with a young child, there are three very important keys that  we suggest:

**\*BE EVER FLEXIBLE**

**\*DON'T FORGET YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR** 

**\*PACK VERY LIGHT**

I worked all day to get a different post up today, but [our slow internet connection](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/3-laptop-fami-2.html#more) did not cooperate as it did not let us upload the [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3) that goes with the story. It's a fun one that is about a beautiful place in France rarely visited by Americans or even most Europeans. Oh well, on to plan B and it will be up tomorrow or as soon as we can get it up. Time to start this category, I guess. As good a plan B as any.

I've also been trying to get some of [my articles](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeanne-dee) up on the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/), but for some reason I'm having a bear of a time getting into the online place where I do that. You can see that we continually [get lessons on flexibility](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html) and keeping a [sense of  humor](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/crazy-travel-ch.html). All lives teach us this, but one on the move, even more so.

We thought [we packed light](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html) when [we started in 2006](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/testing-testing.html), but now we know we could have come with much less and we have become experts on [minimalis](http://zenhabits.net/2010/02/on-minimalism/)t, simple living and [packing very light](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html). Since we will no longer come [back to Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html), we are doing a major purge this month of excess "stuff". Most of it is Mozart's and books, but things that need lots of sorting and attention. Less is more so we are thankful to be free of more "stuff" even if it is painful to say good bye to some beloved books. We will give most to the local school and library.

As we circumvent the globe this year we will take just 1 day-pack sized carry-on bag for each of us that needs to last us for seven months and many countries.  By October, when we get to the U.S.A. we will need to purchase something for books ( primarily) and dvd's. Mozart is a voracious reader ( as are her parents). **We'd love your feedback on what  you think is best for this need....ipad, Kindle, Nook, or???**

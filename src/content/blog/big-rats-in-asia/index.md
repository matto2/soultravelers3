Living in Asia, one often sees  
the unexpected. Travel isn't  
always thrilling, sometimes

[Living in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "living in asia"), one often sees the unexpected. [World travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "world travel") isn't always thrilling, sometimes one must deal with spiders, [snakes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/11/snake-mac-piano.html "snakes"), bugs, [mosquitos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/08/greece-italy-cr.html "mosquitos"), [wild dogs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/pompeiiburied-a.html "wild dogs") and rats!  
  
I know the photo is blurry, but I think I was squealing and running a bit when I took it. Luckily, we don't have to deal with this in our beautiful [rental condo in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "rental condo Penang"),  but because there is so much cooking outside at [Hawker Markets](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Hawker markets") here and South East Asia, BIG rats are a common sight.  
  
I am NOT a big fan of rats or mice and didn't want it to come bite me, but thought I should try to get a photo for all of you. Thankfully, it is not an every day occurance and although DaVinci and Mozat  have seen quite a few ( even one at her [Mandarin school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Mandarin school") ..which has lots of outside spaces!), this was my first. My 84 year old [Mom was with us for 6 weeks](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "3 generation travel with Grandma") last winter and did lots of walking about and exploring and did not see one.  
  
Have you ever seen a big rat while traveling?

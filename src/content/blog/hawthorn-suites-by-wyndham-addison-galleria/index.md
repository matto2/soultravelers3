Coming to Dallas? You can't beat [Hawthorn Suites at Addison](http://www.hawthorn.com/hotels/texas/addison/hawthorn-suites-by-wyndham-addison-galleria/hotel-overview "Hawthorn Suites Addison Galleria, Dallas, Texas") for the best [extended stay](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "extended stay travel") hotel and I explained in [this review](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/best-extended-stay-hotel-in-dallas-hawthorn-suites-addison-galleria.html "best extended hotel in Dallas"), why.  
  
**LONG STAY CONVENIENCE HOTEL**  
  
Comfort, convenience and service makes this a special long stay hotel and [home base](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "home base for travel families ") for us.

**MOST COMFORTABLE BEDS**  
  
The beds here are soooo comfortable that I must write about them as we are all getting exceptional sleep. We can hardly get Mozart out of the bed in the morning as she says this bed is too comfy to get out of. Especially after the [rock hard beds in China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/homestay-china-living-with-locals-whats-it-like-.html "rock hard beds in China"), or [RVing Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "rving europe"), this is quite the treat.

**ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME AND MORE**  
  
As we open the black-out drapes and the sun shines on the freshly made bed, snuggled into a feather pillow, I can't help but feel a bit spoiled by this hotel lifestyle.  
  
We are not use to having maid service and the friendly staff providing what we need like shampoo, dish detergent, towels, handling trash, TP, paper towels, shuttle serviceÂ  etc. that adds so much ease to life, not to mention the kitchen, meals and free coffee.

This is a new way for us to experience our [RTW travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel lifestyle"), so we are enjoying Dallas much more than we expected to and can thank [Hawthorn Suites](http://www.hawthorn.com/ "Hawthorn suites") as our sponsor, for the comfort and making it easy!

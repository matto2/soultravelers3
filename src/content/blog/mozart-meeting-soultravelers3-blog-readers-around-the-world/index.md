One of the best things about writing this travel blog is the amazing people we meet world wide. [Well traveled trilingual teen Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "most well traveled child in the world polyglot") is blessed to have [BFF dear friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "best friends forever through travel and languages") in 3 languages around the world via our [ultimate travel adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "Ultimate family travel adventure")  
  
[Meeting other RTW travel families](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/around-the-world-with-kids-extended-travel-long-term-travel-families-and-friends.html "around the world with kids meeting RTW families") is always a treat ( as we did with [RTW friends in Greece](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/06/rtw-meet-in-ath.html#more) , France, Spain, Asia etc) so we loved recently meeting up with a lovely French family that is living near Sydney in Manly, Australia.  
  
I love the seredipity of how things work in our blessed [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "our family travel lifestyle"). We didn't even know they were long time Soultravelers3 readers of our blog and often entertainment for him on his ferry ride to and from work. They just returned from 14 months of world travel as a family and when they saw we were in Sydney, they invited us for dinner at their house and to stay over night.  
  
Ours was a quickly planned trip, so we hadn't quite booked our last night in Australia, so it worked out perfectly and soon felt like we had known them forever. They even took us to the airport the next morning!  
  
I will write more details about this special meeting, but wanted to share this adorable photo for now as I think our girls look like sisters and they had a ball together.

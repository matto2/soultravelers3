Castles, prehistoric caves, hill towns, lush greenery and a lazy river running through it, makes [the Dordogne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dordogne) an extremely popular vacation region. I've read that some say it is reminiscent of [the Cotswolds](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-england-cotswolds-church-heart-of-england.html), but I don't really see the similarity. (Although [Sarlot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarlat-la-Can%C3%A9da) is suppose to have more Medieval, Renaissance and 17th century building facades than any where else in France, so perhaps that is why).  Luckily, once again, we got there early in the season so missed the crowds, although we ran into a few sprinkles as well in June.

The area is called the Dordogne River Valley and lies east of the [Bordeaux region and St. Emilion.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/biking-st-emilion-bordeaux-vineyards-in-france-wine-country.html) There are lots of campgrounds in this area, but we particularly liked the one we picked La Riviera in Les Eyzies.  Our primary reason for coming here was to see the [world famous prehistoric cave paintings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux).

[Our journey is an educational field trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) after all, so we did not want to miss the opportunity to unit study on prehistoric man via the caves. Plus it would be nice to be able to compare them with [Alta Mira](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/11/altamira-sistin.html) that we saw a month earlier in northern Spain. I had read a lot online about the Dordogne from French travel lovers, so was also curious to check out this area. It's a large area, so we could not see every nook and cranny, but we saw a lot and enjoyed the beauty, river and relaxed atmosphere.

There is a lot to do there for families from [horseback riding](http://dordogneonhorse.com/) to river canoeing, from biking to hiking. It is also known for it's sophisticated food including truffles and foie gras , so one can not go wrong here. More details coming but this is peek. We found it uniquely charming.

Have you been to the Dordogne? Or would you like to go?

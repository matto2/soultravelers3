Oh my God! Can you  
protect yourself from  
every possible travel disaster?

Oh my God! Can you protect yourself from every possible travel disaster? Will these rare but catastrophic scenarios that most travelers so fear and worry about ruin [your holiday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/rock-of-gibraltar-family-holiday-trip-guide-family-trave-tips-information-from-costa-del-sol-spain.html "your holiday"), [vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/darling-dordogne-vacation-holiday-for-families-in-france.html "vacation dordogne") or [around the world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "around the world trip")? More than 67 million Americans spent $1.3 billion on travel insurance in 2006 according to [Travel and Leisure's](http://www.travelandleisure.com/ "travel and leisure") post [World's Worst Travel Disasters](http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/the-worlds-worst-travel-disasters "world's worst travel disasters").  
  
Police and fire truck sirens and helicopter tumultuous sounds ( just feet above our heads), smoke and flames  assaulted our senses, putting us on high alert as a huge fire broke out just yards away from us at our [Barcelona resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/barcelona-arrival-police-omg.html "barcelona resort") on Labor Day Weekend.  
  
Yes, it was very frightening and high drama for a few hours, BUT as a [world traveling family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "world family traveling ") (non-stop for 6 years to 42 countries on 5 continents on $23/day), I can tell you that most travel fears are false as 99.99999% of our travels are free of disasters. We quickly packed up to leave, but did not end up even evacuating and now like most disasters, it makes a great travel story that we will not forget.

It doesn't mean you will never have a travel disaster, because yes, these rare emergencies and natural disasters can even happen at home, but DO know that they are rare and [you can handle anything](http://news.travel.aol.com/2011/04/06/honeymoon-couple-survives-six-natural-disasters/ "you can handle any thing"). I've lived through hurricane, big earthquakes, tornado, fire, floods, snow storms, hospitalizatioins without ever leaving home.  
  
Most of our [travel is blissful,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "travel is blissful") but we have had a few travel disasters along the way to keep us on our toes. Perhaps our [worst travel disaster](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "worst travel disaster") was when I broke my arm riding my bike on the Danube and landing in a foreign hospital via ambulance needing surgery and hardly anyone spoke English. The broken bone cut a major nerve and paralyzed my right dominant arm for over a year with that which probably would have stopped most, but didn't stop us or our pursuit of [travel health](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health"), although it did slow us down and I learned to blog one handed with my left hand.  
  
We had a [car wreck while traveling Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/car-wreck-in-france-dealing-with-disaster-road-trip-nightmare-car-accident-abroad-insurance-problems.html "car wreck while traveling europe") and it took us over a year to deal with the insurance issues. Sadly, we have had to [mourn while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "mourn while traveling") dealing with [death on the road of  loved ones](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/good-bye-dad-grandpa-family-death-afar-while-traveling-abroad.html "dealing with death on the road")  twice is no easy task. I also almost [bled to death](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/11/bloody-monday-i.html "bled to death") in Vienna.  
  
We've had [dental emergenices abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/dentists-travel.html "dental emergencies abroad") but have been very pleased with our [health care abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/doctors-and-den.html "health care abroad"). Our child has had only one minor [travel emergency abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/black-eyed-pea.html "travel emergency abroad"), and almost never even gets a cold, not bad for 6 years of constant [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "world travel") from five to eleven years old! I must admit I had [fears of bringing a 6 year old to Morocco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/monkeys-taxi-te.html "fears of bringing a 6 year old to morocco"), but we are really glad that we did.  
  
Yes, with [long term travel,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "long term travel") one will probably run into some [crazy travel challenges](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/crazy-travel-ch.html "crazy travel challenges"), but for the most part the fear of the unknown is always the biggest challenge and the reality is always easier than the fear.  Here are some good [tips to avoid travel disasters](http://www.bootsnall.com/articles/11-05/7-common-travel-disasters-how-to-avoid-them-and-what-to-do-if-one-happens-to-you.html "tips to avoid travel disasters"). Have you had any travel disasters or challenges? How did you handle them?

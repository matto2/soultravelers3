I love clouds and find them  
often quite magical in our  
travels around the world.

"Aren't the clouds beautiful? They look like big balls of cotton...I could just lie here all day..and watch them drift by...If you use your imagination, you can see lots of things in the cloud formations..what do you see, Linus?  
"Well, those clouds up there look like th map of the British Honduras on the Caribbean..That cloud up there looks a little like the profile of Thomas Eakins, the famous painter and sculptor...And that group of clouds over there gives me the impression of the stoning of Stephen...I can see the apostle Paul standing there to one side..."  
"Uh huh..That's very good...What do yo usee in the clouds, Charlie Brown?"  
"Well, I was going to say I saw a ducky and a horsie, but I changed my mind!"  
Charles Schulz  
  
Are you a cloud watcher?

Family travel is sometimes enjoying  
time at a stunning beach and just  
hanging out with extended family

[Family travel](Family Travel "http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html") is sometimes enjoying time at a stunning beach and just hanging out with extrended family and old friends. This is best done in a short term rental home and nobody does it better than [HomeAway](http://www.homeaway.com/ "HomeAway Vacation rentals").

Here you see our just-turned-10 tween excitedly  entering the beautiful beach home in [Santa Cruz, California thanks to our generous sponsor HomeAway.](http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p292549 "santa cruise beach house homeaway") I will be telling you much more about this fabulous four bedroom beach home that you can [find on HomeAway's website under Santa Cruz](http://www.homeaway.com/search/keywords:santa+cruz+california "homeaway rental vacation homes in santa cruz, california")[,](http://www.homeaway.com/search/keywords:santa+cruz+california "homeaway rental vacation homes in santa cruz, california") but wanted to give you a peek now.

We have not used sponsors much in the past, but as our blog has grown we have connected with  some great partners and hosts that we will be working with which should be a win/win for all. As we circle the globe this year, we will be exploring many ways to travel from [couch surfing](couchsurfing "http://www.couchsurfing.org/") [](couchsurfing "http://www.couchsurfing.org/")to [top hotels](top hotels "http://www.fairmont.com/singapore"), from short term rentals to [long term rentals](long term rentals  "http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html"), from [camping Europe](camping Europe "http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html")  to the [height of luxury.](height of luxury "http://www.fairmont.com/sanfrancisco") This way we can share our variety of experiences with our diverse readership and let you know the inside scoop as we review each place we are hosted. 

We loved this home in a picture perfect, quiet beach neighborhood near family. My step father has been dealing with stage IV cancer for the last 3 1/2 years, so being nearby family sometimes calls for an option like this that allows one to have [intergenerational travel connection](intergenerational  "http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/family-arrives.html") to two sides of family, vacation, kids fun and support while taking everyone's needs in mind.

Have you ever used a rental home for a vacation?

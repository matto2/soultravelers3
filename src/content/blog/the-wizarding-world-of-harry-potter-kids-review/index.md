 My first thought was WOW WOW WOW! If you go there you have to take your time because if you just rush through it then you don't really experience it all.

The best thing there was definitely The Forbidden Journey. You wouldn't really call it a roller-coaster. You would call it tour through Hogwarts with some sharp twists and turns. So if you are tall enough I totally recommend you go on it. But if you or a family member go on it and you don't, than there is a waiting room where they play the Harry Potter movies so you don't get bored. I went on it two or three times because it was soooo fun!

Then at Hogsmeade if you want to buy a wand, but you just want to buy it and not have to wait in a gigantic line, than go into the post office a.k.a the place where it is a half gift shop on one side and a room with a ton of wands stacked up on the other. Because if you see a huge line of people standing outside Ollivanders and you think they are waiting to get a wand, well, you are half right. What it is, is the ceremony of when a wand chooses the wizard.Lucky for the one audience member they pick, but a long wait.

You can pick any of the characters wands, plus more. I picked one that is just like Hermione's and I love it as I have had the [costume since we went to Hogwarts](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html "Hogwarts costume from UK") in the UK.

  If you have a sweet tooth, you have to go into Honeydukes. It is wall after shelf after barrel filled with luscious sweets. I was in heaven!

If you are hungry, go to the three broomsticks where they have a large deli filled with some of your favorite foods. We also had pumpkin juice and frozen Butterbeer. They were okay, but not my favorite drinks. Still, I am glad I tried them and my mom and dad loved them.

If you like a laugh than go to Zonko's joke shop. I myself got a screaming yo-yo that is hilarious. What do you think airport security people will think of that?

And of course there are the two roller-coasters. One, the Flight of the Hippogriff, is a fun one that the whole family can enjoy, and the big one, the Dragon's Challenge I couldn't go on because I wasn't tall enough although it looked like so much fun.

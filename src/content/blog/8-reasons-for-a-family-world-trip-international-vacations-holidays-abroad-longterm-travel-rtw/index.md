To celebrate Soultravelers3 entering our fifth year of non-stop, open ended world travel as a family and blogging. [Twittering](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3), [Facebooking](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=23138026952#%21/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187?ref=mf) ,[YouTubing](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3)  our travel experiences  (and [book writing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html))  as we go, I thought I'd make one of those infamous "lists" posts about **WHY** we do this and **LOVE** it so much.

We have no plans to stop and are excitedly looking forward to adding 10 or more countries this year ( to our 32 so far),  in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html#more), plus Australia, New Zealand as well as  Tahiti and Hawaii , in addition to [one more continent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) to make it five soon. Such a big world, so much to see, so little time, even with the longest life and [long term travel.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html)  We hope to stay on our 23-dollars-a day-per-person super low budget that we have done so far, as we roam, which will be more tricky with added plane travel. We will keep you posted!

Here are our top 8 reasons to [travel the world as a family.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) I've done single travel, couple travel, group travel, [3 generation travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/family-arrives.html#more), travel with friends etc. and in my humble opinion, [international family travel done long term and slowly](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) is the best by far. Why?

**1)** **TIME TO BOND DEEPLY**  
  
In our busy world, time has become the biggest luxury and it is our greatest wealth. Mozart was just 5 when we left and just celebrated her 10th birthday in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html). We have endless gratitude for the massive quantity and quality of time we have had together as we [slow travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html?cid=116681166).  We would never have had this much time together had we not made this choice. Seeing how fast it has gone, makes us cherish this opportunity even more. I am particularly happy that she has had [so much daily time with her father](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/happy-fathers-day-traveling-dads.html), something few children and few fathers get in this world.  
  
**2) BEST WAY TO EDUCATE**  
  
I've already written a lot about the [advantages of travel for education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html) and the [many ways we homeschool while we travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html). Experiencing the world is an amazing education in itself. [Learning is everywhere](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330120a81e7d05970b), not just in the [museums or tours](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html), but in [free kids clubs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html), discussions,  [meeting others](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/marvelous-meal.html), translating between friends speaking only one of your two languages,  [doing art while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/kids-art-creativity-travel-family-friendly-travel-education-homeschool-roadschool-.html#more), and even transportation can be an education. We were just in Paris and let our 9 year old lead the way as she can  find her way in any city in the world now with total confidence, using maps and mass transit like a pro.  
  
**3) HAVING FUN ADVENTURES TOGETHER**  
  
You will find yourselves doing remarkable things in exotic places that you would never have imagined before like riding [camels in Morocco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html), [swimming with dolphins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DwI5p8a3UM) in [Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html), [sailing on the Turquoise Coas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/sailing-away.html)t in Turkey, watching [flamenco in Seville](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/flamenco-in-sev.html)  and [learning it at six in Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/flamenco.html#more), or [eating reindeer meat in a kota in Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html#more). These things give one a deep appreciation of the beauty of this world and it's people and builds confidence in the absolutely limitless possibilities in life. Even middle age, overweight, scaredy cats like me or just an ordinary family like us can be adventurers!  
**  
4) BECOMING A BETTER TEAM**  
  
You will need to work together like you have never done before & will soon find yourselves like a well oiled team as you take [planes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/the-long-flight.html), cargo ships, [overnight trans-county ferries](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/greece-italy-cr.html), [trains](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/long-day-into-a.html), [buses](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/bus-on-ferry-to.html) on many continents and learn to handle [mass transit in umpteen world cities](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/brussels-mini-e.html#more). You will realize like you have never known before, just how valuable each member of your team is and how each one, even the youngest, can sometimes lead or know the answer first.

**5) SEEING & EXPERIENCING THE WORLD TOGETHER**  
  
The diverse beauty of this planet will astound you from the [fjords in Norway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/family-travel-photo-norway-in-a-nutshell-fijords-europe-roadtrip-budget-cheap-flam-train-vacation-.html) to the [fjords in Montengro](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/kotor-riviera.html), from the [Sahara](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html) to [Stockholm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-sweden-stockholm-harbor-boats.html), from [Cappadocia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/moon-walk.html) to [Hallstatt](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/alpine-postcard.html), from [Poland](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-photo-poland-krakow-dumpling-festival-pierogi-value-of-vacations-for-kids-world-peace.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330133ecaaaec0970b) to [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html) and [Pompeii](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/pompeiiburied-a.html), from [Satorini](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/heavenly-month-in-santorini-greece.html) to [Lake Bled](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/beautiful-lake.html) or [Seville](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/ole-sublime-sev.html). Experiencing all these new places together and the amazing people you meet there will touch you,  change you and be part of your shared memory banks forever!  
  
**6) SEEING BEAUTIFUL PLACES TOGETHER BEFORE THEY ARE GONE**  
  
Many of our mos[t spectacular world sights will no longer be with us in the future](http://www.amazon.com/Frommers-Places-Before-They-Disappear/dp/047018986X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1284300037&sr=1-1), so see them now. Places like [Venice](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/venice-via-kids.html?cid=128655394), Taj Mahal and [the Camarague](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html) will no longer exist or be available to tour. Heartbreaking predictions, so I hope all the experts are wrong about [disappearing travel treasures](http://matadornetwork.com/trips/9-places-to-experience-now-before-they-literally-vanish).  
  
**7) PREPARE YOUR CHILDREN TO BE 21ST CENTURY GLOBAL CITIZENS**  
  
In our fast changing world, one of the greatest gifts that you can give to your children, is the opportunity to really experience, connect with and respect the many different cultures on this planet and how we all share the same humanity, love and goodness. In a world full of digital natives, getting smaller by the minute due to technology, we can connect in an instant, but being able to walk the land, know some of the everyday  life of other places, [speak the language](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html#more), experience [the culture deeply through immersion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html) can't help but expand ones horizons, creativity and global empathy. Some what by accident, people like us and the [Frost family](http://www.mayafrost.com/new-global-student-book.htm), have found [family world travel amazingly advantageous for our future global citizens.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html)

**8) LIVING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT**

One of my favorite quotes is:

"To my mind, the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able to experience everyday things as if for the first time, to be in a position n which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted. " Bill Bryson

I love living like that and find [long term travel,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html)  keeps us living in the "now" like nothing else that I have ever done. Sometimes [it is a challenge](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/crazy-travel-ch.html?cid=126083512), especially if one is going too fast, and we have had our [bad moments](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html),  but mostly it gives a real timelessness to life and I think the memories are sweeter, richer, more vivid and  succinct because of the "newness" and focus that creates. I've never felt more alive or more loved. Life often feels magical as if we have angels watching over us and I think that is because we must live most of it in the present moment.

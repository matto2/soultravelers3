If you travel to [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "Barcelona beach resort"), [Costa Brava](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/top-10-costa-brava-secret-gems-spain.html "Costa Brava travel") or northern Spain, you really must not miss the amazing [Salvador Dali Museum](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/dali-musee-hot.html "salvador dali museum") as well as his house and his wife's castle museum ( [Casa-Museu Castell Gala Dali](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g2216488-d274043-Reviews-Dali_Gala_Castle_Museum_House_Castell_de_Pubol-Pubol_Catalonia.html "dali gala museum")). They are called the [Dali triangle](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/holiday_type/arts/article1889090.ece "dali triangle") and even if you are not a fan of Dali you will find them very rewarding. The main museum is one of the best in the world.  
  
They are also family friendly places that will appeal to the whole family as kids tend to adore Dali as his surrealism tends to be wild, wacky and fun, while also being educational. The nature surrounding this area is also very beautiful.  
  
As an [artist, DaVinci](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/davincis-art.html "artist, Davinci art") loved these black and white sketches as it shows just how well trained in art that Dali is no matter how far he takes things. Have you been to any of the Dali Museums or are they on your list?

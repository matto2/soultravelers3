If we want to achieve world peace on a systemic level, we each need to first find inner-peace within ourselves and teach our children how to do this. Kids art tells us so much about their inner world. Mozart got some paints for her recent [birthday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/global-travel-tween-ultimate-birthday-party-in-asia.html "travel birthday"), so  grabbed a piece of cardboard the other day  and quickly, spontaneously  made this sign as she hummed happily in creative mode. It now has an honored place in our [minimalist travel home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "apartment in Penang").  
  
**HOW CAN WE CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD PEACE?**  
  
That sign made me smile and I hope it makes you smile too and remember that child-like innocence and idealism that lives in each of us.  I think one of my greatest contributions to world peace is raising a happy, peaceful [global kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "global kid"), loving my [sweet husband](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/happy-fathers-day-traveling-dads.html "sweet husband "), family, friends and all that we meet on our [world travels](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family world travels"), praying/meditating daily and consciously bringing greater light and love to where ever we are. I even try to keep this blog uplifting as my nature is positive and optimistic.  
  
We could all use more peace in our world and more peace inside in these fast moving, hectic times. Mozart has her finals now at her [Mandarin school in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "mandarin school in Asia ..american kid") and then we will be off to China soon for more immersion,( just got our visa!)  so it's an exciting time for us.

**FAVORITE PEACE QUOTES**  
  
Let me leave you will some wonderful peace quotes on this beautiful Friday to brighten your day and weekend!  
  
"As long as you focus on the outer world you see  
imbalance and dis-ease. But there is no need to  
reside in that because there is a place inside of you  
wherein resides serenity. " - **John-Roger**  
  
"If we are peaceful, if we are happy, we can smile and blossom like a flower, and everyone in our family, our entire society, will benefit from our peace."  
**Thich Nhat Hanh**  
  
"What can you do to promote world peace? Go home and love your family."  
**Mother Teresa**  
  
"Acceptance is very important in the process towards peace.  
It is not saying "I agree with you," but rather it means,  
"I have acceptance towards your point of view. I'm not  
going to kill you about it." It is a kind of a live and  
let live attitude so that we can live in peace with our  
differences. " - **John Morton**  
  
"Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal."  
**Martin Luther King, Jr.

**"When my heart is at peace, the world is at peace."  
**Chinese Proverb  
  
  
**"If in our daily life we can smile, if we can be peaceful and happy, not only we, but everyone will profit from it. This is the most basic kind of peace work."  
**Thich Naht Hanh  
  
**"This is the way of peace: overcome evil with good, and falsehood with truth, and hatred with love."  
**Peace Pilgrim  
  
  
**If there is to be peace in the world,  
There must be peace in the nations.  
If there is to be peace in the nations,  
There must be peace in the cities.  
If there is to be peace in the cities,  
There must be peace between neighbors.  
If there is to be peace between neighbors,  
There must be peace in the home.  
If there is to be peace in the home,  
There must be peace in the heart.  
**Lao Tzu**  
  
" The answer now and forevermore is to love." **John Morton**  
  
What are ways that you contribute to world peace?

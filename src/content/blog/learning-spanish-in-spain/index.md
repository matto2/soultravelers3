[Growing up bilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html "growing up bilingual") and then trilingual, ( and deeply triliterate as well)  has been amazing for our 12 year old. We've almost completed our [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "American girl with perfect Mandarin Chinese") goals and she wants to learn French next. We can't wait for that and also to spend more time in [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html "winter rental spain"), [Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/france-with-kids-exploring-provence.html "Provence France with kids") and all of [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best European vacations") again ( maybe more in [Tahiti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/the-ultimate-tahiti-vacation-on-a-backpacker-low-budget.html "Tahiti tips for budget backpackers") too). Our [ultimate family adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate family adventure") gives us many homes to return to with [friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "friends for kids while traveling") waiting.  
  
There are many extra advantages of becoming a [bilingual or trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html "growing up bilingual or trilingual") from birth, so we started when she was in the womb with both [Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/spanish-crayons.html "teaching Spanish wrting to bilingual kids") and [Mandarin Chinese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "Mandarin Chinese immersion in Beijing"). It's definitely been worth the effort for our [global kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "how to raise a global kid").

**BILINGUAL READING AND WRITING**  
  
Proper [bilingual or trilingual reading and writing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "bilingual or trilingual reading and writing") is a much more complicated process, especially if neither parent is fluent in the secondary languages. Without using local foreign school dips, added to our [homeschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling and travel"), ( or [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html/ "worldschooling or unschooling") as we call it)  I doubt if we could have easily raised such a fluent triliterate kiddo.  
  
Mozart was already very fluent in verbal Spanish before we arrived in Spain when she was five, but she was not reading in Spanish, though she was an advanced [reader](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/10-tips-to-raise-a-reader-book-lover.html "how to raise a reader") in English. She was even beginning to fall behind a bit in her Spanish as her English ( in an all English country) got stronger and stronger. We found out that this is typical for all bilingual kids after about age four as they succumb to the dominant languge ( even when the parents are native speakers of the 2nd language).  
  
  
  
[![typical primary school in Spain where our American kid went to school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3f317df5970c.jpg "typical primary school in Spain where our American kid went to school")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3f317df5970c.jpg)  
  
Foreign local schools are a fantastic way to become multi-literate and multilingual while deeply immersing  in a culture. it's really been an awesome experience! In 20-20 hind sight we see it was one of our smartest decisions on our non-stop-almost-8-year [world tour.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "family world trip around the world")  We also spent lots of time in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "Delicious dinner in Barcelona") with Spanish ( only) speaking friends and [all around Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/travel-to-spain-kids-tips.html "travel to spain kids tips"), so that reinforced the language as well as understanding various accents.  
  
Locals consider her a native speaker, but deep fluency doesn't come quickly and there was a reason we spent those four years and she completed the first 4  grades in Spain. We continue with her Spanish and keeping in touch with Spanish speaking friends even in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/asia/ "Asia travel tips") and as we [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "How to travel the world as a family"). We won't leave Asia until she is reading and writing Mandarin at a 6th grade level.

She was barely six when she started her [first day of school in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html). We're monolinguals who have worked hard to raise her as a very [fluent trilingual /triliterate from birth](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html), but her Spanish was becoming more receptive because she was living in an English dominated society in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "California top travel destinatiions"). Now she is as fluent as a native speaker and still  enjoys reading and talking in Spanish daily.

We are [eclectic unschoolers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html) and mostly do [child led learning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html), but decided to put her into a local school in Spain for [five months for several years to immerse deeply in the language, literature and culture](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html). It was also a way to give he[r consistent friends and a base as we travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html).

The school in Spain that we went to was very flexible. We [traveled Europe by campervan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "travel europe by camper van") for 7 months and then got a  [rental apartment in sunny Adnalusia for the winter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "apartment in spain for winter in Andalusia"), and put her in school for just 5 months. We usually arrived in late November and left in late April. The hours were relaxed, just 9am to 2pm and sometimes we'd take time off for short trips.

This allowed us to also participate fully with local traditions and festivals like [Three Kings](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/3-kings-in-spain-andalusia-festival-tradition-white-village-christmas-epiphany-12th-night.html "3 Kings in Spain at Christmas time") at [Christmas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "Christmas travel to Spain"),  [Semana Santa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html "semana santa") and [Carnival](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/worlds-best-carnival-celebration-spain-photos-kids-family-travel-fun-adventure-lent-in-andalusia.html "world's best Carnival") which became part of us. Also time for [learning Flameco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-flamenco.html "learning flamenco in Spain") starting at six and being part of an [ancient village](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/we-are-living-i.html "white village in Spain") ( while skipping the summer heat of Spain).

**WAYS TO IMMERSE THROUGH TRAVEL**  
  
Not everyone can spend the time that we did ( over 4 years with the school dips) on our [world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing family world tour"), but [long term](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "how to do extended travel") immersion travel can be arranged in various ways for most people who want to make this happen. Some do home exchanges, sometimes just moms and kids go, some dedicate a year and some do it over the summer.  
[![first day of school in Spain for an American kid - making friends easily](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3f3177c8970c.png "first day of school in Spain for an American kid - making friends easily")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3f3177c8970c.png)  
  
I encourage every one who is [raising a bilingual or more child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raising-a-bilingual-child-or-trilingual.html#more "raising a bilingual or trilingual child"), to find a way to do long term immersion as it will make a huge difference and doesn't have to be expensive since [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") can cost less than staying at home.

**CREATING AN IMMERSION ENVIRONMENT**  
  
If you can't right now, here are the key tips for creating an immersion environment no matter where you are:  
  
• One parent only talking in the other language  
  
• Playing music in the other language/s  
  
• Reading books outloud  in the other language/s  
  
• Watching TV/movies  in the other language/s  
  
• Playing tapes of the  parent who speaks the language when they are away  
  
• Making sure she was always responding back, not just understanding  
  
• Helping her know how to respond if needed  
  
• Reading and writing daily when the child is old enough  
  
• Have friends talk to her only in the other language/s

Family travel should always include art, creativity and fun because that is how kids learn and express easily, plus it's effortless to add and makes great travel mementos! We always have a drawing pad & colored pencils in our daypack when we travel, as well as  a note pad and cameras.

[We love how art has always been part of our family world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/mobile-mozart-a.html) and we've written about it many times like [Mozart's Diary](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/mozarts-diary.html) when we began our trip, A Kid's View of Florence [in Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/kids-view-of-fl.html#more) and [Archeology & Folk Museum](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/archeology-folk.html) in Chania, Crete on the Greek Islands. To name just a few past posts on this topic.

When Mozart was 7 and we were visiting the [UNESCO](http://whc.unesco.org/) World Heritage Site [Torre de Belem](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/portuguese-day.html) in [Lisbon,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/luscious-lisbon.html) Portugal, she decided to spontaneously draw it. We love using art as part of our homeschool education as we travel. Kids learn a lot about what they draw.  

  

[Cameras,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/07/new-cameras.html#more) of course, are another great creative travel tool and our [young daughter has been taking travel photos around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/family-travel-photo-sweden-pets-cats-children-travel-photography.html) on our open ended journey. I couldn't agree more with [National Geographic](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/)'s [Rainer Jenss](http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/intelligenttravel/2010/02/give-your-kids-a-camera.html#comments) who recently wrote on the topic of [kids,travel and cameras](http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/intelligenttravel/2010/02/give-your-kids-a-camera.html#comments) on [Intelligent Travel.](http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/intelligenttravel/)  

Recently, on both [Soultravelers3](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html) and the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeanne-dee/seth-godin-linchpin-educa_b_444909.html), I wrote about the [fascinating scientific studies](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/12/why_we_travel.php) that prove the power that travel, particularly [extended trave](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html)l, has on creativity. I also think that [play](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/hanging-out-roa.html) and [being in nature](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/family-travel-photohappy-earth-day.html) is so important in travel or any life. I love this TED talk that demonstrates the power of play for both children and adults. 

  

Just like the art exercise in that video, but strictly spontaneously, Mozart decided to do a quick study of her mom and dad the other day. I particularly enjoy the details she puts in like her dad's slippers and glasses or my Berkies under the table or my messy work table and Mac. I  thought they would make wonderful mementos for remembering our last winter in Spain. I can imagined them framed some day and giving us a chuckle about these sweet memories.

What are your thoughts about travel, creativity and kids art? Do you find yourself feeling more free to be creative when you travel?

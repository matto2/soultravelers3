I am still touched and amazed by rainbows and feel lucky that we had two magnificent ones this week. They actually made each one of us, say, "wow" in wonder. Every rainbow has a story and tends to mark that place in time.  
  
Mystical rainbows remain one of the most spectacular light shows on earth that inspires poems and inspiration. We've been blessed to see so many awesome rainbows around the world during our non-stop [family world travels](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "family world travels") these last six years. They are hard to catch on film, but the memories are forever.

Maybe because I am still a kid at heart, I still get excited every time I see a rainbow or a hummingbird. That sense of magic has stayed with me always. I remember clearly showing Mozart her first rainbow when she was just a few months old...wanting to pass on one of the joys of life. This [double rainbow in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/healthy-easter-in-asia.html "double rainbow in Asia") made a lovely Easter surprise!

One of our most thrilling  rainbows on our open ended [family world trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world trip") was just before we took a [camel trek in the Sahara desert](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html "camel trek Sahara desert") in Morocco.

Another magical and mysterious rainbow landed on DaVinci's birthday on-board a [ferry ship between Italy and Greece.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/adriatic-birthd.html "ferry ship between Italy and Greece")  What a wonderful way to celebrate!

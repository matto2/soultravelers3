Most people miss Austria's second largest city Graz, ( picked as  a Cultural Capital of Europe), but we've been there quite a few times and always enjoy this historical place with it's Renaissance core. We usually stay at [Central Camping](http://www.tiscover.com/at/guide/5,en/objectId,CPS193587at/home.html "Central Camping") which has this amazing and HUGE open air pool ( one the biggest in Europe...over 11,000 sqm) .  
  
It is so big that it seems more like a lake than a pool and has a gravel floor, great views and even ducks swimming around in it! The pool is open to the public, accessible by bus,  but free for campers. We always relish our stays here at this secret gem and look forward to refreshing swims between touring.

Have you ever done a road trip across the United States? We [soultravelers3](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "soultravelers3 around the world family travelers") are planning a cross country journey now for this fall that is somewhat based on a 6 month American road trip that I did eons ago. Yep, that is me and my red fiat and tent on that USA road trip over 30 years ago.

[Digital nomads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomads") are not just a trend today, we did it without the digital part when I was young. I had a ball, so now want to share it with my family.  
  
We left Harvard housing in Cambridge, Massachettes in the cold and snow, then headed quickly to Florida for some sun and relaxation with just a little red convertible, a small tent, and a few clothes. We were headed to San Francisco but took the long route including long stops in Key West, Miami, New Orleans,Big Bend State Park, Grand Canyon and San Diego.  
  
**HELP US PLAN**  
  
We plan to retrace much of that trip but we will start with a flight from Madrid to Miami and won't do the Boston to Miami leg. We're looking for and talking to sponsors now, if you have any suggestions. I'll give you more information when I know more.  
  
**MUST SEE IDEAS NEEDED**

You can help us out greatly by suggesting any "must- see" places along the route! We're in Barcelona now, heading to France, Lake Como, Italy, Swiss Alps, Romania and Budapest on this summer's [Europe road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "europe road trip"), thus, I don't know how I am going to plan all this, but some how it will come together..or change.  
  
**EUROPE ROAD TRIP FIRST, THEN AMERICAN ROAD TRIP**  
  
One of our first stops will be [Harry Potter's Wizarding World](http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/ "Wizarding world of harry potter") as Mozart wants to spend her 11th birthday there. After doing her [6th in Paris,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "paris birthday ") [7th in Salzburg](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/super-7-salzbur.html "salzburg birthday celebration"), [8th in Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/family-travel-sweden-family-friendly-tips-from-kotas-to-pippy-longstocking-camping-stockholm-ice-bar.html "celebrating in sweden"), 9th [in London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html "high tea london") and 10th i[n Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "barcelona paella") it is time for an American birthday and exploring more of her home country.  
  
She also has a brave 5 year old cousin in Miami that she has not yet met in person, who has already had 4 open heart surgeries, so looking forward to that and other family meetings too.  
  
**SUGGESTIONS PLEASE**  
  
All suggestions are greatly appreciated!

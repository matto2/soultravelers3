[Kids, camping](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/questions-answers-about-soultravelers3-family-travel.html), [biking](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/biking-st-emilion-bordeaux-vineyards-in-france-wine-country.html), hiking, sand and water are a perfect combination for [family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html)! Add in a novelty like the highest sand dune in Europe and we could not miss this stop as we left [Spain's northern coast](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/seaside-resort-san-sebastian-spain-donostia.html) and headed into France. This French region along the Atlantic coast is called the "Landes" and is mostly very flat and covered with pines. It's a popular area for tourists from Bordeaux with lots of beaches.

You won't see many American tourists, but we rarely do in our travels into off-the-beaten- track locations. One of the joys and advantages of having so much time to explore Europe has been how it has allowed us to experience so many [hidden gems](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/gorgeous-galici.html). By driving, biking, walking and using mass transit mostly, and having the luxury of time to slow travel, we get a real on-the-ground perspective of places that most will never see. I'll never be able to express my gratitude for this gift we have given ourselves and the more we do, the more I want to do it. Luckily we can share them with you too! So many stories yet to tell.

This spectacular place is called [Dune du Pyla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dune_of_Pyla)  or the great dune of Pilat and is on the coast just a kilometer away from the city of [Arcachon, France.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcachon_Bay) It is [quite impressive](http://hubpages.com/hub/dune-du-pyla) at 3km long and over 100 meters high. One needs the ladder for the steep side, but the other side is more sloping and leads to a remote beach. There are lots of bike trails and one can take a ferry from Arcachon to Cap Ferret.

It is quite pretty in June with the unique combination of pines, wild flowers, large dune and sea views. I've heard that [paragliding is very popular at Dune de Pyla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VcsbOVQ3IU) and looks fun, but it must be seasonal as we saw none. The views from the top are spectacular, but hard to capture on film or video, partly because it's hard to show the scale,  but this gives a taste.

We stayed at a campsite called [Camping La Foret](http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/holiday-search/France/aquitaine/Arcachon/chalet-camping/YYA004) because it had a ladder up the east side of the dune. It was not as big as the [giant dunes in Merzouga](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrrAFDt9W_U) in the [Sahara that Mozart climbed](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html), but  lots of fun, none the less. Can kids ever get enough of climbing or sand? I even enjoyed it, although could not make it up there with my mobility challenges ( bum knee). It looked tempting and I enjoyed watching ( and photographing) Mozart and Davinci way up on top.

Can you see those two teeny specs at the top of the dune from our camper? That is Mozart and DaVinci!

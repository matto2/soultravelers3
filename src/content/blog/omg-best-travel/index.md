I am stunned! Out of a small, select list of tip top, corporate and multi-authored travel websites, who are all leaders in the travel industry from the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/travel/) to [National Geographic](http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/intelligenttravel/)....there we were: [Soultravelers3!](http://soultravelers3new.local/) 

And "what category were you nominated for" you ask?  [BEST TRAVEL BLOG!!](http://www.travel-rants.com/)  
  
You really must run over and vote for us and tell your friends. We probably do not have a chance in the world, but again, I hope not to come in last place. Who knows? If I did not believe in miracles I could not be on this open ended world tour!

It is really easy to do, you don't have to register, just click on the vote button and see instant results.

It is on this website, [Travel-rants](http://www.travel-rants.com/2008/12/02/voting-opens-for-the-travel-rants-consumer-awards/) which is also an award winning, highly popular website based in the UK! Just go there, click and vote! Simple. He has cool graphics that let you see how it is going.Voting ends on Sunday night UK time and the winners will be announced on Monday.

He has been reading our blog for the last twelve months and feels like it was one of the most useful out there for travelers, so nominated us for one the [Travel Rants Consumer Awards!](http://www.travel-rants.com/2008/12/02/voting-opens-for-the-travel-rants-consumer-awards/) Don't you just love it?

There are some amazing sites nominated like [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/), [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel), [Timesonline](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/), [Travelmail](http://www.travelmail.co.uk/) plus more like [Matador](http://matadornetwork.com/), [Travellerspoint](http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/), [Kayak](http://www.kayak.co.uk/), [Uptake](http://www.uptake.com/), [Bootnall](http://www.bootsnall.com/) and [Mr & Mrs Smith](http://blog.mrandmrssmith.com/) ! Wow! These are all heavy hitters in the Travel Industry.

My direct competition are also wonderful blogs like [TravelingMamas](http://travelingmamas.com/), written by four charming women,  
[Europe a la carte](http://www.europealacarte.co.uk/blog/) written by fellow Brit Karen Bryon and a  staff of writers and [Tripso](http://www.tripso.com/) written by a staff of wise  professional travel writers.

So here is little ol' me, just an ordinary mom, trying to write, travel, homeschool and volunteer by taking tons of school kids with us virtually through the nonprofit Reach The World...and I am with the big guns! Wow! I am lucky if I can find wifi half the time and often times have to write my post while we roam. Simply astounding.

I guess you can see why this made my day, can't you? Please vote!

Oh, and that picture is of our Mozart on one of the most thrilling trains in Europe on our Norway in a Nutshell self led jaunt out to fjords. (More on that story coming up!) I just thought it kind of fit the way we are all feeling today. Thanks [Travelrants](http://www.travel-rants.com/) for making our day!! Now it is in your hands, readers. Thanks in advance!

What a surprise and joy it has been this year to watch winter melt into spring.  
  
**CHANGES**  
  
Since we have been primarily in [tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical Asia winter home") for the last few years (to get kiddo's [Mandarin fluency](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent in Mandarin")) and [wintering in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "wintering in Spain") before that, plus her early years in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/california-winter-beach-escape-.html "California winter beach escape"), this has been a unique experience for Mozart.  
  

In the spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of weather inside of four-and-twenty hours. ~ Mark Twain

[![winter melts into spring- melting icicles](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73daef1c5970d.png "winter melts into spring- melting icicles")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73daef1c5970d.png)  
  
**ADVENTURES IN WEATHER**  
  
When we [arrived in Dallas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/dallas-luxury-resort-arriving-to-big-d-in-style.html "Dallas resort Four Seasons Hotel") in January, the weather was sunny and warm, but Texas is known for quite changeable weather, even though the winters tend to be very mild. I laughed when my niece, who lives in Texas said it is not unusual to use the air conditioning and heater on the same day. She is right!  
  
**MOZAR**T'S P******HOTOGRAPHY**  
  
When we moved into [Hawthorn Suites in Addison](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/best-extended-stay-hotel-in-dallas-hawthorn-suites-addison-galleria.html "Hawthorn Suites Addison - extended stay hotel"), there was a sudden cold spell and Mozart thought it was awesome, so took all these photos of the icicles.  
  
**NATURES ARTWORK**  
  
With all that this  [well-traveled kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "Mozart  is most well -traveled kid in the world") had seen [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "around-the-world kid Mozart traveling the world for 8 plus years"), including [skiing in southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/skiing-in-southern-spain.html "skiing in southern Spain"), she had never seen nature do this trick and admired the miraculous artwork of Mother Earth.

**FROM NO VARIETY**  
  
Living on the equator in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/asia/ "Asia travel tips") is a wonderful way to [escape from winter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/escaping-winter-in-tropical-asia.html "tropical escape from winter"), but there is not much variety to the weather. It is always hot and sunny with occasional tropical showers and no seasonal change.  
  
[![winter melts into spring - flowers turned to ice](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73daef221970d.png "winter melts into spring - flowers turned to ice")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73daef221970d.png)  
  
**TO SUPER VARIETY**  
  
Even though Texas usually has a very mild winter, this has been one of the coldest on record. So we have had 80 F days, then the next might be record lows below freezing, even snow, one tornado near by and once even baseball sized hail nearby- (so big that it put holes in car windshields), then back to sun.  
  
[![early spring snow](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73daef24d970d.png "early spring snow")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73daef24d970d.png)  
  
It might not have made the organic farmers happy, or those stuck in traffic due the unusual weather, but it has been an adventure for us that we have enjoyed.

You never know what the day will be, but mostly it is spring now and the signs are everywhere.  
  
  
_Spring is when life's alive in everything._ _\-Christina Rossetti_  
  
  
[![beautiful wild flowers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511a3e30c970c.png "beautiful wild flowers")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511a3e30c970c.png)  
  
  
Mozart and I enjoy taking daily walks and watching the progress of leaves budding out and spring blossoms.

If you've never been thrilled to the very edges of your soul by a flower in spring bloom, maybe your soul has never been in bloom. ~ Audra Foveo.

  
[![fresh picked wild flowers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73daef2a9970d.png "fresh picked wild flowers")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73daef2a9970d.png)  
  
**BEAUTY EVERYWHERE**  
  
I have the habit of looking for and seeing beauty where ever I am.  
  
We were amazed at the [stunning spring flowers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/15-stunning-flower-photos-to-spread-springs-joy.html "stunning flowers") at the [Dallas Arboretum](http://www.dallasarboretum.org/ "dallas arboretum") ( that I will be writing more about), but we also find it when walking in our neighborhood. We spot Cardinals, Robins and let other singing birds serenade us.  
  
[![flowers picked on sping walks](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511a3e32b970c.png "flowers picked on sping walks")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511a3e32b970c.png)  
  
This is more a commercial area, but we manage to find empty grassy lots to [run barefoot](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/grounding-earthing-nature-better-health.html "grounding, earthing, barefooting") in, blossoming trees,tulips, gladiolas and even wild flowers.  
  
**FRESH PICKED WILD FLOWERS**  
  
All of the picked-flowers on this page are the bounty we return with from our walks. Being a [minimalist family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family") on a budget, we just put them in jars we have saved and bring a bit of nature into our home to savor and delight in.  
  
**CHANGE, RENEWAL, RESSURECTION, REBIRTH**  
  
_Nature often holds up a mirror so we can see more clearly the ongoing processes of growth, renewal, and transformation in our lives._ _\-Mary Ann Brussat_  
  
Every culture has spring celebrations with themes of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, ressurection  and regrowth_._ No matter what you are celebrating this season, revel in the blessings all around.  
  
"We always change, renew, rejuvenate ourselves; otherwise we harden.” -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  
  
Lots of change going on here, how about in your life? Where are you finding beauty?

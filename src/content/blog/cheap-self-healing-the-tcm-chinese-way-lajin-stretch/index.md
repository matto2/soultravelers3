We learned some secrets about [Chinese Medicine TCM](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/chinese-medicine-in-china.html "CHINESE MEDICINE TCM IN CHINA") while in [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "CHINA TRAVEL") on a [Chinese medicine tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/traditional-chinese-medicine-travel-in-china.html "CHINESE MEDICINE TCM TOUR AND TRAVEL IN CHINA") and also because the [amazing Mandarin school in Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/learning-mandarin-in-beijing-china-best-school.html "BEST MANDARIN CHINESE SCHOOL IN BEIJING") that we worked with had a fantastic TCM doctor as a principal. This is her teaching our friend Winser from [China Travel 2.0](http://www.chinatravel20.com/ "china travel 2.0") how to do it.

The [Spirit of Lao Tzu](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/confusius-temple-in-beijing-and-tcm-tourism.html "lao tzu china") was definitely all around us in [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/china-travel-temples.html "China travel"). [Immersing in a Chinese school in Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "immersing in a chinese school in Beijing for Mandarin  language learning ") was a fantastic experience for us and our daughter**.** I was thrilled to learn this new self-healing trick too while there.**  
  
SELF HEALING LAJIN STRETCH**  
  
I  loved this simple Lajin stretch machine most of the adults ( parents and teachers) used at the lovely Waldorf style school we immersed in while in [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "Beijing travel tips"). I hear they are very popular in China and they look very easy to make as the design is very simple.  
  
One can even do it will chairs which I have been doing here in [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/penang-apartment-or-condo-rental-plenty-of-choices.html "penang") since we returned and should be able to do most places we travel to. It looks simple, but is actually very powerful if done daily. This hub page gives the basic [instructions on how to do Lajin](http://hubpages.com/hub/Self-healing-techniques "lajin stretch") even with chairs.  
  
Want to try it? Any questions? I adore having this in my health toolbox. How about you?

Wow! [Family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) can mean seeing absolutely stunning theatrical shows like a [world class opera](http://www.arena.it/en-US/HOMEen.html) in an [ancient Roman amphitheater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_Arena) in [Verona, Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/romeo-juliet-in.html). When ever possible, we try to [add cultural advantages](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html) and shows to our f[amily world travel trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) like we did at the [Globe Theatre in London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html) , [Prague](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/11/amazing-don-gio.html) and else where. 

We see shows every time we go to London and soon hope to see the 25th anniversary of [Les Miserable](http://www.lesmis.com/)s in October, which also goes nicely with our recent [summer extended travel to France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-nimes-france-.html) and [Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html) which included homeschooling about the French Revolution and Victor Hugo.

Yes, DO see [Venice on your family trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/12/venice-via-kids.html) to [Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/italian-memoria.html), but if at all possible, [add Verona to your family friendly Italian itinerary i](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/family-travel-italy-verona-farm-stay-agritourismo-romeo-juliet-arena-opera.html)n the summer,  as the operas at the Arena are spectacular under the moonlight, plus  [fun and educational for the whole family.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html)  
  
Go early and bring a picnic like the locals do and sit on the cheap high seats. We did not even book ahead and we were [there in the height of high season](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html). Even kids who might not like an opera at home will love the people-watching and almost ballgame-like atmosphere before the show begins and at intermission where they sell ice cream and such with vendors working the crowds. They also have a tradition before each opera starts where candles are passed and the whole coliseum lights up with candles which kids love and it is an awesome sight to behold. We saw two operas, while there,  [Carmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen) and [Aida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aida), and all of us wish we could have seen more. Both were outstanding  and Carmen was directed by [Placido Domingo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%A1cido_Domingo) ( I happened to go to his 50th birthday party long ago through a friend, so have met him)  and it was designed by one of our favorites, [Franco Zeffirelli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Zeffirelli).Go!

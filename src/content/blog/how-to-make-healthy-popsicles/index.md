What kid doesn't love yummy popsicles in the summer time?  What Mom doesn't want her kid to be eating a [healthy snack](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/healthy-snacks-for-kids.html "healthy snack for kids")? Make home-made popsicles  out of fresh squeezed juice of organic fruit and both can be happy.

We have a juicer so have made them in all kinds of flavors like lemonade, apple, kiwi, banana, mango, pineapple and more. Sometimes we use healthy kefir or coconut kefir added to the mix for creamy pops.  
  
Our 11 year old loves making these yummy pops for herself and all her friends and can do it all on her own ( which I like).  
  
These are orange popscicles, so she just rolls the oranges, cuts them  in half and uses an old fashion ( and cheap) hand juicer, by rotating it and squeezing. (If you are not fussy like she is, you can even put in a little pulp.)  She then puts them in the popsicle molds, and puts them in the freezer. Presto! Done in no time.

She usually needs to put the ones she is going to eat, in a glass of warm water for a few seconds, so she can pull them out.  
  
The healthiest popsicle molds are made out of s[tainless steel](http://lifewithoutplastic.com/en/component/content/article/1-latest-news/163-intoducing-freezycup-stainless-steel-popsicle-mold "stainless steel popsicle mold"), but alas we haven't been able to find that yet in [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Penang"). They are pricey but last a life time .  
  
Do you love popsicles too? How do you make them?

This year we are spending Halloween in Bora Bora, so we bought a costume when we were in [Kauai](kuaia  "https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html") that seemed most appropriate. When you do [long term family travel around the world,](long%20term%20family%20travel "https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html") you have to get creative when it comes to [holidays abroad](holidays%20abroad "https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html").

We have had some very interesting Halloweens while traveling. Like our [first Halloween in Spain](first halloween in spain "https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/happy-halloween.html"), our [favorite Halloween in New York City/ New Jersey](favorite halloween "https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html") with [Wendy Perrin's family](wendy perrin's family "http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/blogs/perrinpost/2008/11/a-halloween-wit.html"), a [Halloween in beautiful umbria](halloween in umbria "https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/ahhhumbria.html"), plus Barcelona and we even have been on the [BBC talking about our Halloween celebrations!](bbc "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/fast_track/9075804.stm")

We are glad we also just got a few weeks at home in the San Francisco Bay area in October to absorb all the local Halloween color. Mozart's aunt also gave her some boo chips and Halloween candy that she loved, so one of many perfect gifts she recieved. We mix Halloween, birthdays, Christmas in our visits!

Have you ever been traveling on Halloween? What is your costume this year? Whether a place celebrates our holidays or not, we do! Hope you all have a great Halloween!!

[**THE UNCONVENTIONAL GUIDE TO FULL-TIME FREEDOM**](http://unconventionalguides.com/cmd.php?af=1619997 "unconventional guide")  
  

We're featured in this cool guide and give all our financial details on how and what we spend as we [travel the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retire and travel the world"). As I have said many times about [traveling cheap](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/top-travel-tip-for-long-term-travel.html "top travel tip for long term travel"), I think it’s very important to understand that [long term travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "long term travel ") is not as expensive as most believe. We find it much cheaper than a conventional life.   
  
[This book](<A%20HREF="http://unconventionalguides.com/cmd.php?Clk=5407823" > Working on the Road</A> "working on the road") shows how ANY one can do it easily if you want to and how to tweak it for YOUR life and needs.

**HOW TO TRAVEL THE WORLD ON A SMALL BUDGET**  
  
We sold our home and most of our belongings in 2005 and  have been traveling the world ever since and it was the best decision of our lives.

**FINANCIAL EXPERT TELLS ALL**  
  
Our friend [Nora](http://www.theprofessionalhobo.com "Nora Dunn the professional hobo") Dunn has been traveling full-time since 2006 and she is also a former financial planner, so  an expert when it comes to money, thus the perfect person to write this. Not only do you get her wisdom, but also tips from more than a dozen other digital nomads in the guide.

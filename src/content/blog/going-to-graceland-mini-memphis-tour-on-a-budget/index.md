Have you been to Graceland, the home of Elvis Presley in Memphis, Tennessee? Having a child like [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/10/mozart-sings-at-the-house-of-blues.html "Mozart sings at House of Blues") who is a [musician who plays 5 instruments](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/03/challenges-of-parenting-a-muscially-talented-child.html "raising a musician "), we couldn't resist adding this destination to our [road trip across America](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/07/road-trip-across-america.html "road trip across the USA"). She had just won her [High Honors Award from Johns Hopkins University CTY](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/09/mozart-wins-high-honors-award-from-johns-hopkins-university.html "High Honors Award CTY") and we could easily add Memphis to our itinerary, so dared not miss it.

 Who doesn't love Elvis? Here is our photo essay of our Graceland excursion to visit the King.

 Memphis is known for many things like BBQ and is the home of Gospel and R&B music as well as the  National Civil Rights Museum, but it's most famous tourist attraction is Graceland. So on our short visit, we made a bee line down Elvis Presley Blvd.,to his palatial mansion, a common pilgrimage for musicians and people who loved him and that historic time in America.

We listened and sang along to Elvis songs on the way and this song too by Paul Simon:  
  
"The Mississippi Delta was shining  
Like a National guitar  
I am following the river  
Down the highway  
Through the cradle of the civil war  
  
I'm going to Graceland  
Graceland  
In Memphis Tennessee  
I'm going to Graceland  
Poorboys and Pilgrims with families  
And we are going to Graceland"

 There are lots of fancy [Graceland tours](https://www.graceland.com "Graceland tours ") available , but we just did a fast self tour since we were on the move and didn't have much time.

 Of course, Mozart had to bring her guitar named "Destiny" and bask in the energy. .............

 We really loved the little cafe...

...with a bunch of great photos of Elvis and furnished in that era, so of course, our teen Mozart had to take a selfie!

I especially liked the nature areas that brought a peaceful feeling and some shade.

There was a sweet bridge over a river as Graceland sits on 14 acres and we felt like we had the place pretty much to ourselves.

We loved Glady's Diner with it's original Wurlitzer Juke box .........

.........and 50's decorations that helped the whole Elvis spirit come alive.

Even if you have a short stay, do make it to Graceland if it is ever on your path. Have you been? We're glad we saw it and skipped the summer crowds!

Can you learn Mandarin  
by watching TV in China?  
Probably not, but if a child

Can you [learn Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "learn mandarin") by watching TV in China? Probably not, but if a child already [knows Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "learning Mandarin in China") well and goes to a [Chinese school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "chinese school in Asia"), it can be another tool to help with the immersion and gaining vocabulary.  When you are [raising a multilingual kid](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "raising a multilingual kid - how to"), I think it is always good to find fun ways to add more language immerstion time.  
  
[Multilingual reading](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "multilingual reading /bilingual reading") and immersing with native speakers is our first choice, but a little TV in [Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "mandarin for American kid") can add some benefits and Mozart loves this CCTV Chinese show about 3 kids.  
  
We mostly live an [unplugged life](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "unplugged lifestyle benefits"), and put strong limits on media screen time as well as junk food as we just think it is a [healthier choice](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/health-and-travel/page/2/ "travel health choices"). Still, tech used smartly with time limits can be useful tools sometimes if used in  moderation.  
  
The only TV that we let her watch when she was little was [Chinese or Spanish](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "spanish and Chinese as second languages") shows like Sesame Street or Disney Classics in those languages. She also liked to watch [operas from the Met](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html "kids and opera and shakespeare") which were in different languages. But we always put extreme time limits on them and made sure she spent lots of time outdoors playing before and after the short TV time.  
  
She hasn't watched much TV in China, but when we are in hotels, we do allow her to indulge as long as it is in Mandarin.  
  
How about you? What are your family policies around media and do you use tech to help with language immersion time?

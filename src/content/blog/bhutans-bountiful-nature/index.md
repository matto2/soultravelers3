A [vacation in Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "vacation in Bhutan") is a bit like going to another planet and another century in many ways. It was one of the most exciting countries that we have visited on our 7 year [amazing family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing family world tour"). We all loved the bountiful nature, [pristine forests](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/bhutans-breathtaking-green-organic-terraced-hills.html "pristine forests") and the ancient Buddhist temples like shown in this photo. Who knew we'd also get a trekking treat?  
  
Trekking is a popular activity in [Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/travel-to-bhutan-.html "Bhutan travel") and since most tourist are older, our daughter was one of the very rare 10 year old American kids who had the opportunity to climb up to the famous [Tiger's Nest.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html "tigers nest trek in Bhutan") Sometimes though, with kids and [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel"), it is the little things they enjoy and remember too.  
  
In May, when we were in [Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/stunning-himalaya-travel-bhutan.html "Bhutan vacation"), there are wild strawberries growing everywhere along side the road. She absolutely adored picking and eating those scrumptious strawberries, so we stopped often and we all got our fill. Here she shows off a cup of freshly picked, organic wild strawberries in her cup.

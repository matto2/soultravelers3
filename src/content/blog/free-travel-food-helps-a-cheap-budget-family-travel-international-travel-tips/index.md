May 2010

Saving money while doing  international  
family travel is often a high priority  
for most and there are many fun ways

[Saving money](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/) while [doing international family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is often a high priority for most and there are many fun  ways that we have learned to do this. Many wonder [how we travel the world so cheaply](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) on just 23 dollars a day per person and we have shared many of our [travel secrets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/our-3-best-kept-family-travel-secrets-adventure-4-years-on-the-road-meme-family-travel-around-the-wo.html) before, including [how to eat healthy and cheap in Europe.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html)  

One happy memory that will stay with us forever is how many free avocados, oranges, lemons & tangerines  that we have eaten during our four winters in our [little village in southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html). Besides being delicious and saving us a bundle, Mozart loves the tree climbing adventure of it all.  One of the great things about [living and wintering in a tiny Spanish village](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html) surrounded by [countryside and farms](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/post-1.html), is the joy of finding the left overs after harvest.

Some of these pictures were taken last year and some this year, but climbing trees and returning home with a load of free supplies has been a richly rewarding part of our [time in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html). Surprisingly, avocados are not that cheap here, despite trees every where, but luckily they leave a lot on the trees, so we feast all winter on them. We're [organic gentleman farmers at heart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html), so this connection to the land also fulfills our souls.

The avocados are so plentiful and they are as fun to eat as they are to gather & we use them many ways.

I always like to tease Mozart and tell her that she is part monkey as she has always loved to climb whether it's to the top of trees, mountains or even the kitchen or [motorhome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html) cabinets! We often take these little forays into the countryside after school and sometimes on weekends.

Mozart loves to gather wild flower bouquets and herbs as well as we wonder and walk the land.

Nutritious food, fun adventure, walking the land, exercise and saving money...what could be better?

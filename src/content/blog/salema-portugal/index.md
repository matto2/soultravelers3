We could walk into Salema from our lovely naturists' campsite, although it was slightly nerve wracking because it was on a curvy road, Portugal is known to have some wild drivers, and there was often no shoulder to walk on. It was not too bad compared to some that we have been on, but we were happy to complete this trek and took a taxi back. Luckily, taxi's are quite cheap in Portugal.

Salem was not as exciting or romantic as Rick Steve's descriptions and there were a fair amount of British tourists present, but it is still one of the most authentic places left in the Algarve. Tourism has taken over  this small fishing village, but they do still fish here and the beach and old town made for nice explorations. If you are into beaches, they have a lovely one here.

We just wandered around, played on the beautiful  beach,  admired the boats pulled up on the sand which is the custom, examined the octopus traps and even tried out the local specialty at one of the restaurants which was marinated octopus.

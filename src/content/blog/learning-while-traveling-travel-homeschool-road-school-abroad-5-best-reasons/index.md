Travel and learning enhance and support each other like a world field trip. Another school year begins and we all think about education for our children.  
  
I've written extensively about [homeschooling abroad or world schooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling abroad or world schooling"), [how we learn as we travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "how we learn as we travel"), [advantages of the global student](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "advantages of the global student"), [how and why to raise a global kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "how and why to raise a global kid") , [how to raise a multilingual child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "how to raise a multilingual child"), [writing in Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/spanish-crayons.html "writing in spanish"), [friends on our ultimate family adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "friends on our family travel adventure")  and more, so obviously I have passion on this topic.  
  
" The world is getting smaller and there is no better education for our global citizens of the 21st century than world travel"  
  
Every morning in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "Barcelona"), like this photo above, our child does her homeschool in Mandarin and Singapore Math etc, out under the trees with a sea view. She does mostly self led learning, often with books she enjoys or websites or educational CD's we find or her electronic dictionary,  but we guide her and she has also been working with her Dean of Studies from her [Mandarin school in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "mandarin school in asia") and [music teachers online](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ar90wOnWnM "music teachers online") via free webcams.  
  
Learning benefits of a global experience go far beyond the formal book learning aspects as some of it  is just by osmosis like [playing with friends in Spanish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIoXlRXIRgk "playing with friends in spanish"),  [visiting museums as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html "visiting museums as a family")  or even [shopping abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/food-shopping-san-sebastian-spain-unusual-markets-europe.html "shopping abroad") in different currencies and metric system.

Having been doing this now for going on 6 years with a school age child ( from 5 to 11 years) while [traveling slowly](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "traveling slowly") to 42 countries on 5 continents ( on just $23/day per person)  and as monolinguals raising a kid fluently reading, writing and speaking Mandarin, Spanish and English, I don't know of anyone with more experience on this topic.  
  
But I don't say do it our way, but find your OWN way as there are endless ways to do this. We found many [ways to add a global perspective](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-3.html "ways to add a global perspective for kids") before we ever left home. I think more than ever in our fast changing world, we [must all find new ways to educate our children](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html "must all find new ways to educate our children") to prepare them for the future. I don't have all the answers and am still learning, but I can tell you about what has worked for us as some of the rewards are already obvious.  
  
  
**BEST REASONS TO HOME EDUCATE USING TRAVEL**  
  
**1) FREEDOM, TIME TOGETHER**, **LEARNING BY DOING**  
  
**2) EASIEST AND CHEAPEST WAY TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE**  
  
**3) HANDS ON LEARNING OTHER CULTURES AND LIVING HISTORY**  
  
**4) MORE TIME IN NATURE**  
  
**5) GREATER ADAPTABILITY, CREATIVITY  AND GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING**  
  
  
Do you use travel at home or abroad to enhance your homeschool or child's education? What are your best reasons? What areas about our global education would you like us to discuss more?

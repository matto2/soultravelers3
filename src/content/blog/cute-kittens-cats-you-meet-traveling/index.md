Stray cats are plentiful in Europe especially in the Mediterranean coastal nations, as well as most Muslim and Asian nations. Cats are just part of our [digital nomad](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/09/vacation-vs-full-time-travel-digital-nomad-lifestyle.html#more) [full time travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2015/03/working-on-the-roadthe-unconventional-guide-to-full-time-freedom-by-nora-dunn-chris-guillebeau-.html) lifestyle.

There are about twenty baby kittens near our [van camping](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/03/camper-van-renovation-vanlife-begins-again.html) spot [here in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/05/what-is-schengen-shuffle-travel-how-to-do-it.html#more) and various ones join us every morning for coffee. Sometimes they sneak under our [glamping tent](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/09/diy-luxury-glamping-near-barcelona-.html) too, thinking it is a fun play tunnel. People who work here feed them daily and kids love to play with and cuddle them.

 We usually sit outside in the morning sunshine and chat and soon we are surrounded by kittens and sometimes maybe their mom and dad too!  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  3 stray cute kittens camping resort barcelona ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  
Lots of cat lovers around as my [youtube shorts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCawzFLlyXP4qtq-rn3N-GBQ) showing these kittens went a bit viral!

 They like to follow me like the pied piper ( sometimes as many as 20 come out of hiding places to chase after me, likely hoping I will feed or hug them).   
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  stray cats in spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  
Some are very friendly and outgoing and love to be held and petted,  some are frisky rascals playing with siblings or cousins and some stay close but behind a bush like the 4th cat in this photo.   
  
**CATS IN EUROPE**  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  cat art door europe old town ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  
  
 Besides endless kittens and cute cats on our travels, we also see lots of cat art! I've forgotten where this cute blue door was, but it made us smile. In the Gothic part of Barcelona there is  huge bronze sculpture known as the [chubby Botero cat](https://www.barcelonaturisme.com/wv3/en/page/1951/cat-fernando-botero.html) created by Columbian artist Fernando Botera.   
  
**SWEDEN**  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  kitty cat in sweden photo by 7 year old heavenly renyna ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  
  
When we were [visiting Sweden](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/family-travel-photo-sweden-pets-cats-children-travel-photography.html) in 2007, our daughter [Heavenly Reyna](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com) ( then 7 years old) took this photo of a cat there that she adored! She is still taking photos and loving cats and kittens and dogs.   
  
**MOROCCO**  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  stray cat in Morocco ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  
 There were lots of [cats in Morocco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/cats-things.html) [](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/cats-things.html)and this one was in [Essouria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/essouria.html) and looked very moroccan and regal but maybe hungry.   
  
**ISTANBUL**  
  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling! Istanbul stray cat ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/8df57e8a1fdc3d18cdf2b7822d5dc9b9.jpg)  
  
 [Turkey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/orient-express.html) ( like many muslim countries)  is known sometimes as the City of Cats. Some people even jokingly  call [Istanbul](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/topaki-palace-b.html)  "'Catstanbul". Like so many places, they are just a normal part of life and have been for centuries.   
  
**TURKEY**  
  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling! Turkey cat from Van with 2 colored eyes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/1bba448cbc1a6a431b66f41c8380b985.jpg)  
  
We spotted a few of those Van cats with one blue eye and one yellow eye that we had heard about that are native to Van, [Turkey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/turkeys-turquoi.html). This little van kitten was caged as it was for sale in a market.   
  
**GALICIA, SPAIN**  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  cat in Galica farm  horreos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/de2d4da85df857f6e8eb8f31a87f0cc2.jpg)  
  
There are lots of stray cats all over [Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html) and it seems like most Spaniards enjoy them and think of them as part of the community. The cat population in [Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/11/fun-barcelona-day-trip-to-sitges-tips.html#more) was measured in 2021 at approximately 5.86 million! Unique to [Galicia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/gorgeous-galici.html) are [horreos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B3rreo) that are built off the ground and hold grain. They are curious granaries made of slitted stone, raised on stilts to keep rodents and moisture out, and topped by crosses. They add charm to the landscape and we even found this one with a door open and a cat looking out amongst the corn.   
  
**BULGARIA**  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  caturday cat lovers flowers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)

I loved this sweet cat our first [digital nomad summer in Bansko](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/08/-europes-cheapest-digital-nomad-haven-bansko.html#more)! There are lots of stray cats and dogs in Bulgaria. There were a bunch of kittens near the place we stayed at that were very lovable and fun. The stray dogs can be a bit scarier as they can travel in packs.  
  
**GREECE**

<script src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

It was really fun meeting this friendly cat at one of the top Monasteries in Meteora, Greece. We often see cats around sightseeing tourism spots because I suppose travelers feed them. Greece is filled with stray cats.   
  
**CYPRUS**  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  stray cats europe ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
There were tons of stray cats in [Cyprus](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/02/slavaukraini-ukraine-memorial-in-cyprus-.html#more). One digital nomad that I met who adores cats ended up feeding and then adopting a few and traveling on with them. I think you can adopt the stray cats from various places, but look up how to for the correct details depending on the country.   
  
**MONTENEGRO**

  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  cats in kotor riviera montenegro](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  

We loved the stray cats in Montenegro like this cutie at our Kotor Riviera airbnb long stay home. Kotor is a Unesco medieval town that is called a [cat lovers dream](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/montenegro/kotor-montenegro-cats-travel-medieval-b2318323.html)! There were a bunch of super friendly cats that hung out near us and I saw neighbors throwing them food and scraps. They loved to be cuddled.   
  
**KOTOR**  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  cat lovers cudding cat in Kotor ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)

 There is even a travelers store with cat souvenirs called [Cats of Kotor](https://catsofkotor.com) and many more [cat-devoted shops](https://danijelascatshop.me) and a charity called  [Kotor Kitties](https://www.instagram.com/kotorkitties/?img_index=1) that helps to feed and medicate stray cats.  
  
**CROATIA**  
  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  cat on beach in Croatia ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
Croatia is another place where there are tons of cats and kittens roaming free across the country, even at the beaches.   
  
**BANSKO**

  
![Cute Kittens & Cats You Meet Traveling!  top of the mountain hiking cat bulgaria bansko](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
This regal looking cat roamed near us in our second summer home in Bulgaria that was closer to the ski areas and woods.

Dubrovnik is also quite famous for it's many cats and I adored this black one that was always purring away and wanting our attention at our airbnb.

 I think this cute cat sign and stairs was in Montenegro, but I am not sure if it was Kotor or Budva.

One of the most delightful and captivating encounters with cats happened with this hearty mother cat in Greece. As we rested in the shade at another monastery in Meteora, I saw a tourist give part of their sandwich to this cat. At first I thought it might be a bit of a greedy male cat with such a big treat.

Then I was shocked to see her go straight up a large rocky mountain and much to our surprise, suddenly we saw a bunch of kittens who soon came out of hiding and  were gobbling up her food prize and meowing with delight.

Sorry the quality is bad because it was in deep shade and gotten quickly by phone, but it was quite a fascinating moment that a few of us tourists from many countries witnessed in awe!

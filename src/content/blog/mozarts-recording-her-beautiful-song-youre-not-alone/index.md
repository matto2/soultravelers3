**RECORDING**  
  
[Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "Teen Mozart singer and most traveled child in the world") is in the studio this week doing a professional recording of this song with Scott Bryne! Oh my gosh! We are so proud of her.  
  
They're actually going to do two versions, one for Dallas Lovato and the movie producers that have interest and one for one of the top music managers in the business who has interest in her. [Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "Mozart beautiful teen singer songwriter, musician") is so excited as it is truly a dream come true!

**MOZART'S SONG ON ITUNES**  
  
We'll let YOU decide which one ( or which one first) should go on itunes. This is a pretty thrilling moment for our [homeschooled](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "Homeschool high school") [world traveling teen](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "Mozart travel expert teen speaker & singer"), who has put us all on a very fast moving train this past year, as we changed our lives to accommodate her talent and passion for [singing, songwriting and music](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/09/tween-is-a-talented-singer-songwriter.html "beautiful Mozart talented teen singer, songwriter, musician "). Our parenting style is always to follow and support her lead and passions, but some times that is intense!  
  
It hasn't even been a year because we just arrived here from [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/05/asia-dream.html#more "Asia dream") in February last year. With all that is happening behind the scenes ( can't tell all yet), we're really glad that we have taken these risks, as now we see we're clearly on the right path.

We just put this song on Youtube with our little inexpensive camcorder, so can't imagine how beautiful the song will sound when professionally produced. It should be done around December 17th & we will share it with you and the world.

**MOZART'S SINGING PERFORMANCES AND RADIO SHOW**  
  
Mozart has been working very hard & recently sang that song and others on the radio ( you can hear the whole [show & interview here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLa_c4W5X38&list=UUFowrc5MytvYAuqaLtQ4a7g&index=5 "Mozart on Radio interview and singing")). She also is doing many performances, like at Six Flags Over Texas for the next two weekends, Hilton Anatole in Dallas, Opening Bell and volunteering at the Snowball Express.  
  
Here are just a few of the amazing  comments about this song from people around the world that we have never met ( and many are musicians!). Quite humbling and encouraging for Mozart! ( Below that you can see the song lyrics).

♥ This is so moving, Mozart. I feel that some girl somewhere (hopefully more than one!) will see and hear this song right when she needs it to gather up the courage to reach for help to get her back home where she belongs. I am very impressed by your compassion on this tragic and sensitive topic. Keep singing your songs and they will reach . . . those who should hear. (Or it could be a mother who will be encouraged upon hearing this to hope for . . . and fight for . . the return of her child currently in the grips of human trafficking.) Your song will make a difference somewhere, I'm convinced.  
  
**GRATITUDE**  
  
We want to thank all the people who have supported and believed in Mozart as we have so much to be grateful for this Holiday Season. Wishing you and yours great joy!!

You’re Not Alone ( Lyrics) 

VERSE 1

There's a girl, Somewhere

And she's scared for tomorrow

 There's a place where she goes 

In her heart,  In her mind, In her soul   

She calls it home

She calls it home

CHORUS

Skies of blue, shining through

 in your eyes, in your eyes

Skies of blue, shining through 

in your eyes, in your eyes

Welcome home, you’re not alone

VERSE 2

I see ﬁre, in you

I see ﬁght, seeping through 

see the light you create

It's no crime to be afraid 

Of what will come

Of what will come

CHORUS

Skies of blue, shining through

 in your eyes, in your eyes

Skies of blue, shining through 

in your eyes, in your eyes

Welcome home, you’re not alone

BRIDGE

Just be brave

And have faith

Your time will come someday 

You'll be saved

Don't be afraid 

not anymore 

Welcome home, you’re not alone

CHORUS

Skies of blue, shining through

 in your eyes, in your eyes

Skies of blue, shining through 

in your eyes, in your eyes

Welcome home, you’re not alone

Welcome home, you’re not alone

Where is the best place to shop in [Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "beijing best of")? Thier colorful antique market called Panjiayuan certainly stole our hearts and our local friend also enjoyed the great prices. We found it to be a [favorite spot in China,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "China travel favorites") so we want to go back!  
  
We bought a few wonderful [souvenirs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/souvenirs-what-do-you-buy-.html "souvenirs and travel") including a hand painted scroll, frog rings for kidlet and a hand embroidered antique cloth..the latter from the lady in this photo. DaVinci said we were ["dragon hunting"](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "visiting china and dragons") beecause  we bought several things that had dragons on it.  
  
One of the best parts was watching the shocked face of locals breaking into smiles when Mozart started her expert [bargaining in Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "mandarin immersion in China"). She would draw a little crowd and they seemed both amazed at her [perfect Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "perfect mandarin from school in Asia") and her skill at bargaining. Little did they know that she loves to haggle for things and has been doing it around the world in many languages and cultures.  Fun video and more on this soon!

Traveling to [Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/bye-bye-barcelo.html "Barcelona") and [Costa Brava](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "Costa Brava")? Don't miss the amazing Catalan food and delicious cava which is [sparkling Spanish wine](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/12/happy-new-year-nochevieja-from-spain-soultravelers3-review-traditions-grapes-cava-.html "cava sparking spanish wine"). Cava was invented in 1872 in the Penedez region near Barcelona and we find it especially delicious! We've been to some amazing [wine caves in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/the-heart-of--1.html "wine caves in Europe"), including [many in France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/route-des-grand.html "wine cellars France") , [Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/ahhhumbria.html "Italy wine") and one on [Santorini](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/santorini-wine.html "Santorini wine"), but this had special meaning to us because of the company.  
  
We are very blessed to have friends in this area and they took us to one of the [best Catalan Restaurants in Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/best-catalan-food-in-barcelona.html "best catalan restaurant in Barcelona") namedÂ  [Ca N'Ayxela](http://www.restaurantcanayxela.net/ "best catalan food in Barcelona"). It is a very popular spot with locals and the tradition here is to start first down in the ancient wine cellar for some cava and typical [Catalan Cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_cuisine "Catalan cusine") like several different kinds of homemade sausages and olives.  
  
Some of the bottles of Cava in the background were over a hundred years old. Thinking about our "amigos espcieales" or [special friends](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "special friends") and the [wonderful meals and times](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "wonderful meals and times like paella") we have shared together. Yum, wait until I share this entire meal with you of typical Catalan dishes, wine and desserts!  
  
Have you tried Catalan food or Cava or European wine caves? Cheers and happy Wine Wednesday!

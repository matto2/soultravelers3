Luckily, NYC is so full of a huge variety of things to do there won't be time for any eye-rolling adolescent angst or drama.   
  
Our [world-traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "most traveled child in the world") [teen Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/02/teen-mozart-singing-red-carpet-grammys.html "Teen Mozart singer, actress, traveler") has been to New York City many times, such as [visiting at Halloween](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html "visiting NYC at Halloween with Wendy Perrin") at 8 with [Wendy Perrin](http://www.wendyperrin.com "wendy perrin")'s family, [staying at airbnb budget rental](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/airbnb-best-budget-lodging-for-nyc.html "airbnb nyc stay ") at 11, and being the [youngest reporter at NYFW](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/09/mozarts-adventures-during-new-york-fashion-week.html "mozart was youngest reporter at NYFW") at 13, even won a [Broadway ticket to Wicked](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/09/nyc-broadway-best-secret-winning-wicked-lottery-tickets-cheap.html "how to win a broadway ticket to wicked") and  always loves this city.

They only had a weekend and I made suggestions like seeing a Broadway show again, the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-nyc-usa-metropolitan-museum-of-art-egyptian.html "kids at Metropolitan Museum of Art nyc") again, Rockefeller Center again ( Top of the Rock) , TMZ Celebrity Tour, MOMA, Madame Tussauds, boat around Manhattan, Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty etc., as possible ideas.

Mozart's friend Maggie had never been to New York or been on a plane, nor had her mother, so they delighted in the adventure. They loved just walking around and enjoying the sights as even the buildings, traffic and fire stations are exciting in this city.

They took a ferry that stopped at the Statue of Liberty, Wall Street, and Ground Zero Memorial and relished learning a little history in this fun way.  
  
They loved going to M&M's World in Time Square as well as the NBC Experience store where they pretended they were on the Voice and bought some "Friends" souvenirs.

They got some famous cannoli at the famous Carlos Bakery from Cake Boss TV show. 

 A big part of the joy was just walking around, being in an exciting city, planning their own weekend itinerary and having a 3 day sleep over in a fancy hotel! If you travel to NYC with a teen, perhaps the smartest thing is to invite another teenage friend and let them do the planning. What are your best ideas for a weekend in NYC with a teen?

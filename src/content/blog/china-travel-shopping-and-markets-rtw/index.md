One of the [great pleasures](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/lifes-simple-pleasures.html "simple pleasures") in [China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/big-sister-in-china.html "china") are the markets and on this big [shopping day in America](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "shopping USA over consumerism"), I am remembering the fun of recently  [bargaining in China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/panjiayuan-antique-market-beijing-best-gifts.html "bargaining in China") outdoor markets.  
  
Here you see us enjoying the Muslim Quarter, which was the eastern most point of the famous ancient Silk Road trading route between [Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Europe vacations best") and Xi'an ( 西安 ) used for hundreds of years. The exotic sights and sounds of Old China haven't changed much here and one feels like Marco Polo discovering it for the first time.  
  
We certainly had advantages with a [Mandarin speaking kid](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin speaking American kid") with us who has bargained at markets [around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "around the world family travel"), taught by her father, the king of frugal.

[Xi'an](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an "xian, china") is one of the oldest cities in the world, the former capital of China through many of the most importanT dynasties in Chinese history and dates back over 3000 years. People have settled in the area for over 6,500 years and it was the thriving largest city in the world when Europe was engulfed in the dark ages.

Have you spent [Chinese New Year in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Chinese new year stunning photos")? To really understand the [Spring Festival](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/chinese-new-year-in-asia.html "Chinese new year in Asia") Year of the Sheep, one has to be in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/asia/ "Asia travel tips") and better yet be Chinese! The next best thing is to live in or do extended [travel in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/escaping-winter-in-tropical-asia.html "escaping winter in tropical Asia") and participate in how millions celebrate this holiday.

In America I never thought much about [Chinese New Year](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/chinese-new-year-celebrations.html "Chinese New Year celebrations") and didn't know what "Kung Hei Fat Choy" or "Gong Xi Fa Cai" meant. Unless you are a Chinese American, it is not a big holiday in America.

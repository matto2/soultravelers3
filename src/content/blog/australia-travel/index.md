We're off on our second trip to [explore beautiful Australia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/visiting-the-sydney-opera-house-must-see-australia-travel.html "explore beautiful australia") on our 8 year long [family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "family world tour"). Some day, we would love to do a long stay to explore this fascinating country, but now is not the time. ( Mozart got this cute Koala on our last vist).

**AUSTRALIA AS HEALING DESTINATION?**  
  
This time we are going primarily as part of our [healing journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "Healing journey") and visiting an amazing healer, [Dr. Joseph Da Cruz](http://www.wholisticdentistry.com.au/about_dr_da_cruz.html "Dr Da Cruz"), (who with [Dr John Diamond](http://www.drjohndiamond.com/ "Dr John Diamond") and [cranial sacral therapist Najma Ahern](http://www.craniosacral.com.au/aboutus.html "najma ahern cranial sacral expert")) is doing [innovative things](http://www.lifeenergyfoundation.org/category.php?id=38 "innovative dentistry")  that I will be writing more about in detail soon.  
  
 **CURING GUM DISEASE, CAVITIES, CROOKED TEETH, TMJ** **AND CHRONIC DISEASES**  
  
In writing my book about [how I cured my gum disease](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "curing gum disease and cavities"), I've met truly magnificent healers like [Ramiel Nagel](http://www.curetoothdecay.com/about_us.htm "Ramiel Nagel") and  [Carol Vander Stoep](http://www.mouthmattersbook.com/therapy-services/ "carol mouth matters")  who led me to this and I will be doing a whole series on the blog that will stun you with the natural healing possibilities.  
  
Thus, we will be based in [Canberra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra "Canberra") area first, the capital city of [Australia](http://soultravelers3new.local/australia/ "Australia") and possibly check out the vineyards, museums or [parliament](http://www.visitcanberra.com.au/Things-to-do-and-see/National-attractions/Business-Details-Page.aspx?ID=9002591&Title=Parliament+House "visit australia parliament") if we have time.   
  
**CELEBRATING MOZART'S 13TH BIRTHDAY IN SYDNEY**  
  
[![Celebrating a very special birthday in Sydney, Australia - another travel dream](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019b00ad3654970d.jpg "Celebrating a very special birthday in Sydney, Australia - another travel dream")](http://aviary.blob.core.windows.net/k-mr6i2hifk4wxt1dp-13110504/4db26893-8257-46cb-8cbc-80440403090f.jpg)  
  
**AUSTRALIA MAKES FOR A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION**  
  
The second purpose for our trip to Australia is to celebrate our daughter's 13th birthday in Sydney at the amazing [Four Seasons Hotel](https://www.facebook.com/FourSeasonsHotelSydney "four seasons hotel sydney facebook page"). As the [world's most well traveled kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "world's most well traveled child"), you can imagine how many awesome [birthday celebrations she has experienced around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "birthday celebrations around the world") starting with her [6th birthday in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "celebrating 6th birthday in Paris").  
  
**CELEBRATING BIRTHDAYS AROUND THE WORLD**  
  
She celebrated her 7th [birthday in Salazburg](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/super-7-salzbur.html "birthday in salzburg"), ( and [Dalmation coast](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/dalmatia-coast.html "dalmation coast"))  her [8th birthday in Stockholm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html "8th birthday in stockholm"), her 9th [birthday in London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html "birthday in london"), her 10th [birthday in Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "birthday in barcelona") , her 11th birthday at [Harry Potter's Wizarding World](http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/ "harry potter's wizarding world") at [Universal in Orlando Florida](http://www.universalorlando.com/home/home.aspx "Universal orlando"), and her [12th in Asia with Chinese friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/global-travel-tween-ultimate-birthday-party-in-asia.html "birthday in Asia").  
  
**HOW MANY KIDS CELEBRATE BIRTHDAYS IN 9 COUNTRIES ON 4 CONTINENTS?**  
  

Lucky kid! This will be the 9th country and 4th continent that she has celebrated a birthday on our open ended world tour! These things blow my mind sometimes.  
  
**DIDGERIDOO - LEARNING TO PLAY FOR FUN AND BETTER HEALTH**  
  
So looking forward to also learning the [didgeridoo](http://www.howtoplaydidgeridoo.com/Why%20play%20didgeridoo/Playing-for-health-and-wellbeing.html "didgerindoo") and jamming there with a local expert too! This amazing instrument is fun and [healing](http://healthandwellness.kaplan.edu/articles/cam/DoYouDidgeridoo.html "didgeridoo healing") ( like [Buteyko Breathing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteyko_method "Buteyko breathing and health")) so we hope to buy one and travel with it from now on for our [musician](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/tween-is-a-talented-singer-songwriter.html "teen talented songwriter, singer, musician").  More on this soon.  
  
**OFF TO OZ**  
  
I will post this ahead, but we are about to catch a plane, so I will catch you on the other side!  
  
Where is the best place you ever celebrated a birthday?

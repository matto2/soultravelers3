 The beautiful UNESCO World Heritage Site, [Saint-Emilion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-%C3%89milion "st Emilion") is by far the prettiest French town in the Bordeaux region of France. It is a perfect base for a bike holiday or [France vineyards cycling vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/biking-st-emilion-bordeaux-vineyards-in-france-wine-country.html "France vineyards cycling vacation") like we did as a family.

Surprisingly, it was not crowded at all in June, but the weather was perfect for biking. We stayed at a  [campsite, Domaine De La Barbanne,](http://www.saint-emilion.org/uk/Hotels-Restaurants/Campings.htm) which was one of our [favorites in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "best campsites in Europe"), nestled in the heart of Saint-Emilion's [world class vineyards.](http://www.spectator.co.uk/wine-club/features/2186771/st-emilion-world-heritage-wine-wonder.thtml) They had 2 swimming pools, a lake, tennis courts, restaurant and even cottage rentals for those without an RV or tent and the empty country roads were perfect even for the littlest member of the family.  
  
The viticulture in Saint-Emilion ( part of the fertile Aquataine region and Bordeaux appellation) was begun by the Romans and the vineyard landscapes are classic. Some call it the most beautiful village in France. Saint-Emilion  benefitted during the middle ages because it is on the [pilgrimage](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/pint-sized-pilg.html "pilgrimage on camino to santiago de compostela") route to [Santiago de Compostela](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/santiago-de-com.html "santiago de compostela pilgramage camino"). Fun for us to have many connections between these places full of history.  
  
Have you been to Saint-Emilion or is it on your list?

Family travel or a "family holiday" as the British say,  in [southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "southern spain holiday") means visiting beautiful [sugar cube villages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html "adalusia white village") perched on verdant hills near the sea. The center of these villages metaphorically speaking, is the big square around the church.  
  
This is  a photo of the 15th century church and square in our little village in Andalusia. In summer it is a great place to hang out and eat at the restaurants. All the holidays like [Easter week (Semana Santa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html "easter week semana santa spain")) , [3 Kings ( Los Reyes Magos](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/3-kings-in-spain-andalusia-festival-tradition-white-village-christmas-epiphany-12th-night.html "3 kings epiphany in spain")) , [Carnival](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/worlds-best-carnival-celebration-spain-photos-kids-family-travel-fun-adventure-lent-in-andalusia.html "Carnival in spain"), [New Years Eve ( nochevieja](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/happy-new-year-nochevieja-from-spain-soultravelers3-review-traditions-grapes-cava-.html "New years even nochevieja in spain")) and more are centered here.  
  
Weddings take place here. First Communions are a very big deal in Spain and done differently ( and older) in Spain. Mozart enjoyed attending her classmates "Primera Comunion" at this church and square . When someone dies they do a procession by walking through the whole villlage, starting at this church and ending at the cemetary at the opposite end.  
  
I must say we really miss village life when we are in Asia as it is one of the joys of life in Spain for us. Have you been to [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/andalusia.html "Andalusia, Spain")?

American culture at it's best, eh?

Thus, we see it as an educational entertainment opportunity.  Well, perhaps the multilingual commercials count too.  

Despite having a large screen TV, it's the only television that we watch, ( and we purposely do not have cable) although we do usually watch a movie on Friday and Saturday nights using the dvd player. We also like reading Shakespeare together, playing games, reading, going to movies...but a litte American reality TV is a silly diversion popular with [tweens](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/mother-daughter-bonding-tips-for-tweens.html "tweens and bonding") and [retiree](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retirement travel")s, so suits us too, even if we are a bit [different](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/being-different-its-a-good-thing.html "being different").

As Lazaro audtion tape shows ( along with the almost 3 million views for it), he has one of the most unique stories ever for American Idol and a moving voice. If he doesn't touch your heart, then you must be missing one. I think it is a miracle that he even made it to the top 10 because his stuttering limits him in so many ways, making simple things like talking to the judges, his fellow contestants, or entertaining blurbs for the show, so much harder than for the rest.  
  
Lazaro Arbos is certainly not the best singer, but that can be said of most of the popular singers today and I don't think the best singer has ever won on American Idol, probably because becoming a top singing artist takes a lot more than just singing talent.  
  
Who was the best singer last year? Was it Joshua, Jessica Sanchez or Phillip Phillips and his very limited range? Probably the very best singer got eliminated before the top 10, because it is about more than just vocal talent. Stars like Madonna, JLO, Bob Dylan, Nicki Minaj, Tom Waits, Britney Spears, Johnny Cash, Rihanna, Taylor Swift etc etc, can't really sing and have very limited vocal range, yet that never stopped their stardom. It doesn't matter how good your voice is if no one is buying your records. Go to most any black church and you will find folks with better voices than those stars.

I don't expect Lazaro to win and we like many of the top 10, so not attached to any one singer, but I am happy to see him get this time in the sun. Mozart loves Lazaro too but is rooting for Angie as her favorite (she is also dealing with a serious physical challenge, so very admirable). All ten will benefit from this exposure and that is a good thing for these hard working, talented kids involved with a tough business. I think Candice, Kree, Amber and Angie have the best voices, but Angie and Lazaro have the most charisma and are the cutest.  
  
I don't think Lazaro was quite ready,  but his charisma and heart seem to be winning him votes. This makes me happy because those votes should translate into a record selling career no matter how far he goes on Idol. It seems he never worked with a vocal coach until after he got accepted for Idol and never sang professionally. He didn't even have enough experience to do anything but chorus in his small towns musical last year and only recently found a church to sing in. So tons of natural talent that just needs experience.  
  
Unlike his critics, I could care less that he forgets a lyric now and again as that is all about lack of experience at being under this kind of pressure. He also just immigrated from Cuba when he was 10 and lives with Spanish speaking parents in mucho Spanish speaking south Florida, so I think language plays a part in remembering lyrics as he is the only one who is singing in his second language, but no one seems to mention that impact.  
  
It seems he has a LOT less experience than the others in the top 10 as these shows are not really about amateurs any more, but professionals finding a way to get more exposure. Kree ( popular with the judges and DaVinci likes), has been singing professionally since she was 3 years old, been on TV a lot- starting as a kid, offered a record contract and sings professionally in Nashville now with a band.  
  
It is not surprising that she and the others with much more experience are more polished.Several others have lots of professional experience, have even done American Idol before. Angie is showcased in her Dad's chuch weekly with her band.

Having the "total package" is what is needed for a successful singing career and I think that Lazaro meets this more than the rest ( except maybe Angie), despite his lack of experience and handicap. I AM also happy to see so many talented women contestants this year too and wouldn't mind a female winner.  
  
When I  grew up, I knew a family with  5 boys who stuttered severely like Lazaro and felt their pain as I do his. Such interesting karma for a talented singer and interesting how his handicap help build his talent as it was his best way to communicate. I am proud the world is responding to his purity and talent, despite his challenges and the critics.  
  
Some say he is getting the sympathy vote, but I think it is the admiration vote and love vote. It doesn't matter if he wins or not as he has already won, but this is why I love Lazaro (and America for voting for him):  
  
  
**HE IS INCREDIBLY BRAVE**  
  
**HE IS AN INSPIRATION**  
  
**HE IS A GREAT SINGER**  
  
**HE HAS SUCH A PURE HEART**  
  
**HE IS SUPER TALENTED**  
  
**HE HAS TREMENDOUS CHARISMA**  
  
**HE IS SO LOVABLE**  
  
**HE IS UNIQUE**  
  
**HE IS SO CUTE**  
  
**HE DRESSES IN HIS OWN STYLE**  
  
**HE SHOWS HIS FEELINGS**  
  
**HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL SMILE**  
  
**HE IS NOT AFRAID TO CRY**  
  
**HE IS VULNERABLE**  
  
**HE IS SEXY**

**HE IS MYSTERIOUS**  
  
**HE IS SPANISH**

**HE IS NOT A WHITE BOY WITH A GUITAR**  
  
**HE IS DIFFERENT**  
  
  

Are you watching this show? Who are you rooting for?

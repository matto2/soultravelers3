A stunning area of France, filled with surprises, we thoroughly enjoyed our time in Bordeaux, the wine capital [of the world!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux) Absolutely perfect for family travel, with something for everyone! We were based in [St. Emilion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Emilion),  [a UNESCO World Heritage Site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/932), with it's charming, medieval old town, vineyards all around and underground galleries plus catacombs.

June is a perfect time to be there before the crowds arrive. The [campsite, Domaine De La Barbanne,](http://www.saint-emilion.org/uk/Hotels-Restaurants/Campings.htm) was one of our favorites in Europe, nestled in the heart of Saint-Emilion's [world class vineyards.](http://www.spectator.co.uk/wine-club/features/2186771/st-emilion-world-heritage-wine-wonder.thtml) They had 2 swimming pools, a lake, tennis courts, restaurant and even cottage rentals for those without an RV or tent ( like most campsite in Europe). I think it was far superior to any hotel stay for family travel.

We met a lovely family from Scotland on holiday there and Mozart had great fun with her new friend and catching baby ducks! It is a perfect place to do lots of bike rides amongst the vineyards, relax, swim, do wine tasting and enjoy great food in a beautiful environment.  
  
This is the second in our series of videos of [vineyards around the world](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jYiqGE2VjQ). You can see our first one that we released this past January about [Alsace at harvest time, here](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/01/route-des-vins-dalsace-france-at-grape-harvest.html#more). We also have the unique vineyards from [Santorini in this video.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/heavenly-month-in-santorini-greece.html#more)  
  
  
  
One of the surprises were these [old fashion bikes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing) that went by while we were touring in the old town one day! I was happy to catch this shot just as the big one went by. I'll be adding more stories and photos from our fun time there, but here are a few.

The wine of course, is legendary and we all enjoyed that, even Mozart... imitating her dad at a tasting, with her water! Mozart has been playing in vineyards since she was five months old, but we did not realize she would find wine tasting rituals around the world  so much fun to experience, at such a young age. She adores it! Don't hesitate to mix vineyards and viticulture with a family vacation!

Mozart helps her dad, DaVinci, in our California vineyard when she was 5 months old! She only weighed about 10 lbs at the time & people would literally gasp when I put her down on her own, but she has always been a mover, ready to get on with life and be out  in nature discovering.

Mozart playing in the vineyard during autumn's first big rain post harvest.

Before having children, we never considered mixing our love of viticulture with a child, but Mozart took to it all like a duck to water, as children raised on vineyards always have. It's been a wonderful addition to our world tour with great home school benefits. How many of you have done or considered vineyard vacations with kids?

I've just added this to the photo Friday on [Deliciousbaby!](http://www.deliciousbaby.com/) Come join in the fun!

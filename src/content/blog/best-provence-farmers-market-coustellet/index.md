One of the great joys of [visiting Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/beautiful-provence-tips-and-photo-avignon-france-.html "beautiful Provence Tips ") is the exquisite [food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/family-travel-food.html "family travel food") and visiting colorful, lively farmers markets which are so much a part of the culture. We were lucky to visit some of the best in [southern France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html "Stunning Horses in the Camargue, France") and especially fortuitous to visit the [Coustellet Farmers' Market](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616128-d6777520-r364679844-Marche_de_Coustellet-Coustellet_Luberon_Vaucluse_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html) with Thierry, the owner/chef  of the spectacular [Le Mas Des Gres](http://masdesgres.com/en/ "Le Mas des Gres charming hotel Provence")  ( a quintessential Provencal farmhouse and small charming hotel) where we stayed in the heart of Provence.

Marche de Coustellet ( as they call it in French) is the oldest market in Provence and a producers market with mostly organic food and artisan local products.   
  
![Best Provence Farmers' Market  - Coustellet in the Luberon](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d29d29bd970c.png)  
  
Thierry and his teen aged son Yanis come here every Sunday and know everyone as they've owned the hotel for almost twenty years.  Thierry teaches cooking classes to adults and children at the hotel and it was exciting to watch as they were picking out the makings for the scrumptious cuisine that we would be eating later.

 I love to just look at all the beauty in these markets and take photos to share with you, like this homemade bread

 People watching is part of the fun, like this farm producer from Spain who now lives here and was full of smiles.

 yummy cherries ( that I became addicted to on this trip)

 and endless vegetables, oh my! Thierry would give me the inside scoop of what he liked and didn't and why.

We were up early for this market ( and I let [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2016/03/mozart-sings-her-original-song-dear-heart-official-music-video.html "teen singer Mozart singing her song \"Dear Heart\" ") sleep in) as we went to another famous antique market at nearby L’Isle sur la Sorgue before lunch. I will write a separate post about that thrilling market.   
  
![Truffles in Best Provence Farmers' Market  - Coustellet in the Luberon](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d29d2a7f970c.png)  
  
Provence is famous for it's black truffles which are called black diamonds in the culinary world as they are the best in the world as 80% of France's truffles come from this region. Yes, Thierry bought some and we partook later as I love truffles. Note the artisan product of truffles in olive oil and below you will see honey with lavender.   
  
![onions french  Best Provence Farmers' Market - Coustellet ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c912ef1b970b.png)  
  
 Even onions look divine displayed in this market and I always delight in the French signs, don't you? That adds a charm you won't see in our wonderful local farmers markets.   
  
![lavender honey at Best Provence Farmers' Market - Coustellet ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c912ef25970b.png)  
  
 I learned a new word in French when I saw this honey with wonderful artisan touches like adding lavender.

Just like at home, there was a familiarity as we watched the famers and artisans set up from their trucks, but there was definitely a Provence and French style to it all in their products, displays and way of doing business.   
  
![wine in Best Provence Farmers' Market  - Coustellet in the Luberon](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb09b61df3970d.png)  
  
  
I liked this pretty display for a local Côtes du Rhône wine in one corner backed by a house on the outskirts of the market

as well as the colorful umbrellas, green trees and blue sky in another corner. Let me know if you love Provence market photos as I have so many remarkable photos to share so might do some more posts or photo essays.

So loved this appetizing Provence market experience, but it was time to head back to Hotel Le Mas Des Gres as Mozart and I were off with Nina soon to visit the antique market before lunch.   
  
![Hotel Les Mas Des Gres in Provence Luberon area ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c912f570970b.png)  
  
Mozart had performed at this magnificent terrace at dinner the night before ( we'll be posting that story soon) and was happy to perform again for the crowd at  their famous Sunday Brunch/Lunch. After her [Keynote Speech in the UK](http://soultravelers3new.local/2017/06/mozartignitetour-in-europe-mozart-dees-keynote-speech.html#more "Mozart Dee Keynote Speech in UK") at the Baltic Centre of Contemporary Art, (seen [here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMcNRYjsEt0&feature=youtu.be&a "Mozart Dee's Keynote Speech in England"), she did a 10 city concert tour in Europe and Provence was the charming midpoint on her #MozartIgniteTour.

The food of course, was stupendous, a mouth-watering Mediterranean masterpiece of Provencal choices

 and all of it was made from the delectable local vegetables, fruits and supplies  
  
![Provencal Cuisine at Hotel Les Mas Des Gres](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d29d3ecf970c.png)  
  
 we had gotten that morning from the market,   
  
![Stunning Provence buffet at Hotel Les Mas Des Gres](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c912f61a970b.png)  
  
mo st of it organic, so fresh from farms nearby and stunning to look at and glorious to taste.

This is truly Provence and the Luberon at it's best. That's the other owner, Nina ( Thierry's wife) sitting across from Mozart at this delightful lunch. They speak French, German and English well and take exceptional care of all their guests. On the other side of Mozart is the amazing [Corinne Russo](http://culturecouleur.com "Tour guide provence ") who was our magnificent guide recommended by our long time online friend in Marseille, Provence [Claude Benard](https://twitter.com/claudebenard).

Mozart's original songs and light-up-the-world smile just added to our perfect day in Provence. What is your favorite market in Provence or else where?

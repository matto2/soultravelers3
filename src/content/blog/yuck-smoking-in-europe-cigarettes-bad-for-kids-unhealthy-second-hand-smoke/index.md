![smoking in Europe, Yuck!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330133f1e3a210970b.jpg)

I love Europe and I love Europeans, but one thing I just do not get is the endless ignorance about cigarette smoking. Even worse, how unaware they are about how bad second hand smoke is around kids. It is not uncommon to see tons of people smoking around babies and children.

This is just something one does not see much in areas that I lived at in California. Most smokers in California have become aware that they are [harming others with their second hand smoke](http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/secondhandsmoke/a/secondhandsmoke.htm) so most educated people would not think of doing it around children. I am really surprised that they do not do more to [educate people about the harms of cigarette smoke in Europe.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12649053)In Germany, there are still road signs advertising cigarettes.

People walk baby carriages while smoking, pick up their kids from school while smoking, bring kids in smokey bars and restaurants ( I know there are bans but many do not seem to pay attention to them) and there were always tons of nurses etc outside of the hospital in Austria that I was in, smoking away on breaks. It often makes me feel like I'm in a time warp as the dangers of cigarettes have long been proven.

One does adjust to it to some extent and we avoid it as much as we can, but I must  admit this is one area that Europe is far behind in ( or at least compared to California as perhaps there are some areas in North America that are just as bad).Tobacco kills one person every six seconds so it is beyond me why there is not more education for Europeans about this deadly habit. There seems to be a decrease than when I first visited Europe in the seventies, but it is still horrible here. Many smokers here do not believe smoking is harmful so part of the problem is education. I am amazed at how tolerated it is even amongst non-smokers.

What are your thoughts on European smoking? Why is  there  not more social pressure, education and social support to help more people quit this deadly habit?

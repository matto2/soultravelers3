Paleo Road Trip  
  
Can you do a road trip, vacation  
or travel the world and eat healthy  
on a very non-standard diet?

Can you do a [road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/road-trip-usa-best-of-the-west.html "road trip USA"), [vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best european family vacations") or [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "travel the world") and [eat healthy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "eat healthy") on a very non-standard diet? YES!   
  
We eat [Paleo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/healthy-banana-bread-recipe-paleogapsgluten-free.html "paleo")\-[Primal](http://www.foodrenegade.com/why-i-heart-paleo-primal-wapf-diets/ "primal eating") - [WAPF](http://www.westonaprice.org/ "weston price ") - [GAPS](http://www.gapsdiet.com/ "gaps diet") style ( eating more veggies than many vegans) for healing and [preventing cavities and gum disease naturally](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "preventing and curing gum disease and cavities naturally").  
  
![bananas!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd154aab970b.png)  
  
SECRETS TO CHEAP, HEALTHY EATING  
  
We mostly [eat organic](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "why eat organic"), avoid GMO's and all processed foods, no sugar, bad industrial fats (modern refined vegetable & seed oils like canola)  or conventionally grown meats, [eggs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raw-eggs-healthy-or-not.html "raw eggs for health") or [dairy.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/raw-milk-fast-and-cure.html "raw milk fast cure")  
  
Plus, we live on a very tight budget, have a [super minimalist life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/minimalist-family-frugal-tip-omg.html "super minimalist life"), and  [travel with little luggage](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/top-travel-tip-for-long-term-travel.html "top travel tips for packing light"),so  [travel and healthy primal eating](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/travel-and-paleoprimal-grain-free-gapswapf-healthy-eating.html "travel and paleo/primal grain-free, gluten free diet") on the move, as a family, has become an art form for us.  
  
![How to Stay Healthy While Traveling - paleo road trip ideas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fd154adc970b.png)  
  
KEEP IT SIMPLE  
  
Here are some examples of our [road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/camping-or-roadtrip/ "ROAD TRIP ") meals through the Southwest. We had a small cooler with us and a lunch bag sized one that folds flat when not in use. We actually used many of the same foods on our long plane rideS from [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/05/asia-dream.html "ASIA TRAVEL") to [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/california-winter-beach-escape-.html "CALIFORNIA WINTER BEACH ESCAPE"), so basics remain the same, like keep it simple and plan ahead.  
  
PLAN AHEAD  
  
On our [health journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "health journey") I am always looking for [cheap health secrets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "cheap health secrets") for our [minimalist family.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family")  
Profound but [simple ideas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/grounding-earthing-nature-better-health.html "grounding for health") or [recipes](http://soultravelers3new.local/recipes/ "recipes for healthy living paleo/primal/GAPS/WAPF") that we can use as we [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "travel the world") for our [travel health](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "travel and health tips"), but also for you at home on a budget.

EASIEST, HEALTHY PORTABLE FOODS  
  
We found pastured eggs even in Asia, so boiled eggs are always a dependable, easy, on-the-move snack. Many meals we ate in the car while moving, so portable food like a banana, apple, boiled egg or Nick's Sticks etc are essential. We also did picnics and help-yourself meals in our room, on [historic route 66](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/historic-route-66-.html "historic route 66"),  or on the train to [Grand Canyon.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/grand-canyon-family-adventure.html "Grand Canyon")  
  
![delicious gluten free food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511c4e45e970c.png)  
  
  
We often ran into refrigerators in hotels which helped and some hotels fed us delicious gluten-free primal food we could eat and then, even boiled pastured eggs for us for our road trip travel like [Four Seasons in Santa Fe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/romantic-winter-getaway-santa-fe.html "Four Seasons Santa Fe").  
  
![family road trip with special diet restrictions](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511c4e478970c.png)  
  
Our car was packed full and we ordered some things before leaving [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "top california destinations"), because the health choices in the USA are like no where else in the world.  
  
HEALTH FOOD ON THE MOVE  
  
Nevertheless, finding health food stores on the move is not easy, so we had a short list of supplies that we could pick up if needed at a regular grocery store based on [EWG's list of clean and dirty foods](http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php "clean and dirty food EWG").  
  
Most places have avocados and they are very satisfying. Organic baby carrots, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers are portable and usually easy to find in the U.S..  
  
![fresh fruit and veggies](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511c4e495970c.png)  
  
  
HEALTHY FOOD TIPS  
  
We don't usually eat many nuts because of [phytic acid](http://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/living-with-phytic-acid/ "phytic acid cons"), but we enjoy them on trips for their ease and satiety. [Julien bakery](http://www.julianbakery.com/ "julian bakery") makes a gluten-free decent almond thin cracker that is handy for the road. [Vital Choice](http://www.vitalchoice.com/shop/pc/home.asp "vital choice ") canned wild salmon is also road trip worthy and has an easy-open top.

HEALTHY PORTABLE SNACKS  
  
Sweet potato chips by [Honest Chips](http://www.honestchips.com/ "honest chips") are the only ones we buy for the road, because they are pure and cooked in cold-pressed coconut oil, so actually good for you. Mozart loves making our [healthy chip recipe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/yummy-healthy-chips-recipe.html "healthy chips recipe") when we are at a base!  
  
WHY GOUDA CHEESE  
  
We are big believers in [kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "making kefir with goats milk or coconut milk") and [raw milk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/raw-milk-fast-and-cure.html "raw milk") but make an exception with [gouda cheese](http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/gouda-the-nutrient-dense-cheese-of-choice/ "gouda cheese health benefits") ( and sometimes brie) on the move, due to it's [high vitamin K benefits](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/06/17/heart-healthy-cheese.aspx "cheese benefits"), portability, taste and ease in availability.

HEALTHY FOOD AND LIVING IDEAS  
  
We've learned many things on our [healing journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "healing journey"), like [DIY healthy shampoo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-diy-homemade-shampoo-and-creme-rinse-easy-cheap-healthy.html "DIY healthy shampoo") and [homemade healthy deodorant](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-diy-homemade-deodorant-easy-cheap-healthy.html "healthy homemade deodorant")  to cooking [real food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/omg-an-oven-in-asia.html#more "oven in Asia for real food") and learning to make [healthy ice cream](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/easy-healthy-homemade-ice-cream-no-machine-.html "healthy ice cream recipe"), [calfouti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/yum-super-healthy-dessert-recipe-paleo-mango-clafouti.html "healthy desert recipe mango"), [fermented salsa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-salsa.html "fermented salsa recipe"), [pizza](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/best-paleo-pizza-recipe.html "healthy pizza paleo"), [goat cheese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/how-to-make-diy-goat-cheese-with-kefir.html "goat cheese"), [mayonaise](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/how-to-make-homemade-lacto-fermented-mayonnaise.html "fermented mayo"),[bone broth](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/how-to-make-nourishing-bone-broth-recipes-to-heal.html "bone broth"), but healthy road trip food has it's own peculiarities.  
  
HEALTHY FOOD ON A BUDGET TIPS  
  
I hope this helps you. We've done [healthy road trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "europe family road trip") on several continents [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "around the world travel"), so we learn and master it as we go and it is always evolving.  
  
What are your top [healthy travel tip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "healthy travel tips Europe")s for special diet needs on the move?

[Sunset](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/sweet-sunset.html "sunset and inspiration") at the romantic [Alhambra in Granada](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/granadas-alhambra.html "alhambra in granada, spain") with a passionate left handed guitar playing gitano ( gypsy) couldn't say exotic, [evocative Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday/comments/page/2/ "best southern spain holiday") any stronger.  
  
Thus, this is one of my [favorite photos](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/the-ultimate-travel-photo.html "best ultimate travel photo") on our [world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing family world tour") as we just got lucky to catch this "guitarra y alhambra" magical moment at [La Alhambra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/la-alhambra.html "La Alhambra") with our little [Moorish princess](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/03/ancient-princes.html "Alhambra with kids - moorish ancient princess"). Then later, we topped it off with a scrumptious dinner and soothing [Andalusian Arab bath and spa](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/ahh-arab-baths-andalusia-spa-malaga-granada-benalmedena-massage-hotspringsthemal-water-roman.html "Andalusia best spas and romantic arab baths").  
  
I can still hear the [music](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/music/ "music") in my ears and it makes me want to start a [flamenco dance](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/flamenco.html "Flamenco in spain"). We are a bit homesick for [Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "Spain tips costa del sol") at the moment because we are usually there at this time of the year, but until we complete the [fluent in Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent in mandarin") process here in [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/asia/ "Asia travel tips"), we must satisfy ourselves with our photos and [videos of Spain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99t-NPNCipE "making paella in Spain") and talking on Skype with our [friends](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "friends kids and  travel") there.  
  
This delicious photo was taken at Plaza St. Nicolaas ( Mirador de San Nicolas)  in The Albaicyn in [Granada](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/camping-spain.html "camping spain"), the most breathtaking place to view the Alhambra. This photo makes it easy to see why this elegant  800 year old Islamic oasis and fortress is one of the most popular tourist attractions in [Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Best vacations in Europe").

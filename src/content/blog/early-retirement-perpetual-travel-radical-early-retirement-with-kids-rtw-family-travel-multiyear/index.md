Who doesn't dream about [retiring early](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) or radical early retirement and living luxuriously on little as you [travel the world slowly](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html)? You can love your job and still want more freedom in your life or more time with loved ones [exploring the world.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) Today it is easier than ever to retire early and be a [perpetual traveler.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_traveler) It is also cheaper than living at home and we do it on just 23 dollars a day and have been to mostly expensive countries. That's DaVinci above,  doing a little work on our investments  online as we hang out at the pool amongst the world class vineyards in [Bordeaux, France near St. Emilion!](WanderingEds%20%20%20%20#traveltuesday%20-%20travel%20writers%20share%20top%20tips%20for%20#airlines%21%20thx,%20@irishfireside%20@soultravelers3%20@jcreaturetravel%20http://fb.me/AIm4sQ5T)

As we told the [Frugal Traveler](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html) in [The New York Times](http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/qa-with-jeanne-dee-the-nomadic-family-traveler/),  we were inspired by authors Paul and Vicky Terhorst who wrote [Cashing in on the American Dream](http://www.amazon.com/Cashing-American-Dream-How-Retire/dp/0553052896/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1276611412&sr=1-1). We were also inspired by Santa Cruz natives, [Billy & Akaisha Kaderli](http://www.retireearlylifestyle.com/) and we have become online friends with them  and hope to meet both couples  in person one of these days. Both of these couples did radical early retirement over 20 years ago and are still loving their lives as perpetual travelers.

One can also do [mini-retirements](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) which we have written about and we are [case studies in the new 4-Hour Workweek](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/the-4hour-workweek-review-by-world-traveling-family-rich-global-digital-lifestyle-design.html) where [Tim Ferris](ttp://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) coined the term. The mega hit [The  4-Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Expanded-Updated-Cutting-Edge/dp/0307465357/ref=pd_sim_b_2) is a must-read for anyone looking to create more freedom in their lives. You should also read [Your Money or Your Life](http://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1276625385&sr=1-1) and [Vagabonding.](http://www.amazon.com/Vagabonding-Uncommon-Guide-Long-Term-Travel/dp/0812992180/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1276625428&sr=1-1)

We are an ordinary family so had the normal fears and concerns before retiring early and  doing our open ended world tour, but now that we are four years into it, we have a passion to let others know that it is easier, cheaper and more rewarding than you can even imagine. Yes, even retiring with a young child!  We have a ton of information on this website ( find some key posts on [our FAQ page](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/faqs.html) or explore by country or topic) and will be adding more and e-books as we have time. Little did we know that our blog and website would turn into another mini career, but we enjoy the creative outlet as long as we can stick to a four hour work week.

Here are more sites that can help you with your planning!

The preparing and planning part is not always easy, but it is worth the effort. I read somewhere that all early retirees tended to live frugal lives well below their means long before they retired,  so that is a good place to start I think. Do you dream about early retirement? What are your plans?

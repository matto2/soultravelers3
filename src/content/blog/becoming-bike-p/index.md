Well of course the title is an exaggeration and half joke,but we did feel quite proud of our new skill and the exploration we did this day. We got up early and got in late, so had a full day of exploring the area by bike. We went into Edam, then back towards the campground over a bike trail near the ocean towards the next town Volendam and even took a ferry over to Marken where there are homes set up in traditional way with hosts dressed up in traditional clothes.

Now we know for sure that we like Edam best because it has been a quiet, pretty  town for us. Volendam has pretty sail boats and yachts, but it was much too filled with busloads of tourists and tourist shops for my taste. The ride to there was very pleasant tho, once we found the bike path. I especially enjoyed the sight and sound of five swans taking off for flight between several sail boats. We wanted to visit a cheese and Dutch shoe making place, but the day was fading by the time we got there and it was an either or choice with Marken, so we decided to take the ferry instead and see that bit of history.

We did enjoy playing tourist, tho both DaVinci and I were approached separately by Dutch tourists and asked questions in Dutch as they assumed we were natives here. That was a fun surprise. We could not resist buying some red wooden clogs for Mozart and two little Dutch dolls dressed in traditional clothes. Mozart also got a teeny tiny doll sized pair that are very cute and has become addicted to a particular ice cream cone here that is quite yummy and they are everywhere including the restaurant next door.

We stopped at a deli type of place in Edam and bought a nice lunch which we had on a bench in the shade near a canal. The bikes have a little lock with a key fitted right in them,so they are very easy to lock and leave anywhere which allows for lots of freedom. We also stopped into a salon after lunch and got Mozart’s bangs trimmed as they are about to cover her eyes. The man who owned the salon has a daughter who loves visiting San Diego so we talked about that, and DaVinci enjoyed the good coffee. They did a  great job, were very friendly and being in a new country makes even simple things like this an adventure.

The Netherlands seems full of beautiful boats, endless water and bridges, brick roads and sidewalks and lots of very green grass. One does not normally think of cows, sheep and horses next to sailboats, but it is a common sight in Holland. We have been captivated by all of the views and cool breeze as we ride or walk and take it all in.  We savored another sunset dip and slide into the water on our return.

We are enjoying decompressing from the intense prep for this trip and are starting to feel in the flow of our new life. Pleasant day runs into pleasant day, mixing adventures and sweet family time together going at a slow and easy pace. We do a little homeschool in the morning and more book reading and Story of the World at night before bed. It is easy to lose track of what day or time it is and we have enjoyed not looking at a paper or listening to news. We have a short wave radio and will probably like to tune in at some point, but for now it is nice to live in this timeless paradise.

One of the great delights of family travel, is the spontaneous joyful moments that seem to come out of nowhere. We went to [Bilbao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao) to see the fantastic, [world famous Guggenheim](http://www.guggenheim-bilbao.es/?idioma=en) and didn't really expect to find the area so charming as I had read some negative things about it.

Despite it not being a travelers campground, we ended up really enjoying the [Sopelana campsite](http://www.campingsopelana.com/index.php?hiz=en&opt=&subopt=) that was at a nearby beach and they even had good free wifi, sea view and pool. It is just a kilometer away from a metro station that goes to central Bilbao.

We must have arrived on a festival day of some sort and on our way to the metro we stopped and enjoyed the celebrations including this fun folk dancing. They also had a band with a typical Basque flute, [txistutx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Txistu) and lots of activities for the locals.

This was taken last year, but I have not had a chance to get them up, so I'm going to be posting last years travel along with this years and hope it is not too confusing. We were there around the same time last year, so I'm wondering if it related to the [big festival today in Barcelona](http://www.barcelona-online.com/whats_on.html).

I am going to get as many up as possible while in Barcelona, so will probably be heavy on pictures and light on words. Do you like folk dancing too? What fun moments have you run into by accident while traveling?

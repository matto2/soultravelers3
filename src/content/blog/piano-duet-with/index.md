Mozart and DaVinci last spring doing a piano duet together in San Jose, California when she was five.  
She did her first violin concert at two years oldÂ  and her first piano recital at three years old and has always loved to perform for a crowd. They enjoyed learning this one together and other fun things in this class.  
I believe it was May 2006.

Oh, and everybody’s favorite Grandmother too. Yep, that is my mom who is one of the sweetest people on the planet and today is her birthday. Happy Happy Birthday Mom!! She is on the road like us  today (visiting friends and relatives in the Southwest), so I can not wish her a Happy Birthday, thus I thought I would put her up on the blog. Ain’t she cute? I always tell her that and she shakes her head and says she is too old to be cute, but I think she is adorable inside and out. She is only five foot two or three and all her kids are taller including her two sons who grew well past six foot three and altho she is the oldest of seven she is the shortest...but one always forgets because her heart is so huge.

She is a great golfer too (just won some best of tournament trophy from a recent trip) and was a great ice skater (a la Sonia Henny) when she was young Perhaps Mozart gets some of her athleticism from her. She has an old trophy from being a Spelling Bee champ and is a endless reader & loves puzzles, so maybe those talents were passed on too. They certainly have been best buddies since the day Mozart was born and there is sure something grand about sharing your beloved child with your beloved mother (which we waited a long time to do so perhaps makes it even more precious).

I do not have too many pictures of her with us and this one is suppose to be a vertical shot, it is dated and the hair-do has changed, but I like it. My dark auburn haired Mom still has less grey naturally than most people half her age, just like her dad. I have always loved the bounciness of her naturally curly hair and how the reddish highlights shine in the sun. Her mother died when I was a toddler and she was in her twenties, so I feel so grateful to be fifty something and to still have a Mom around to love, cherish and be good friends with. It is a good thing she has some ancient genes (I grew up with four great grandparents and my parents did not marry early) as I don’t think her kids will ever willingly let her go. Not to mention her husband, grandkids, siblings and endless friends.

Thanks for just being you Mom and the wonderful example of loving that you have always demonstrated. Where ever you are on the road, I hope you are having a wonderful birthday!

My mother had a slender, small body,  
but a large heart  
a heart so large that everybody's joys found welcome in it,  
and hospitable accommodation.   
Mark Twain

Mother is the name for God  
in the lips and hearts of little children.   
William Makepeace Thackeray

Mother love is the fuel  
that enables a normal human being  
to do the impossible.  
  Marion C. Garretty

My mother is a poem  
I'll never be able to write,  
though everything I write  
is a poem to my mother.

You don't want to miss Chinese New Year in Asia! We have had a spectacular time enjoying our first [Chinese New Year in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/family-travel-year-of-the-rabbit-in-asia-photos-chinese-new-year-.html "Chinese New Year in Asia") as a [multi generational family vacation](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "multi- generational family vacation") and spent most of it in [Georgetown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town,_Penang "Georgetown") [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang"), but also visited Thailand.

[Chinese New Year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year "Chinese New Year") seems to be the very best time to visit the [UNESCO World Heritage and iconic sites of Georgetown](http://www.penang-traveltips.com/george-town-unesco-world-heritage-site.htm "Unesco world heritage site of georgetown Penang") as they are all decorated, people are enjoying themselves and the tropical winter weather is perfect.The whole country takes over a week off from [school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "School in Penang Mandarin") and work and all three major cultures participate some here which gives it a special flavor, although it is is primarily the ethnic Chinese.

Most of these photos were taken at the Chinese New Year Cultural and Heritage Celebration at the UNESCO Heritage Sites in Georgetown, Little Penang Market  and we visited the [largest Buddhist temple in SouthEast Asia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwbU_OGfSQg "largest Buddhist temple in SE Asia Kek Lok Si"), the stunning [Kek Lok Si Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kek_Lok_Si "Kek Lok Si Temple") on Chinese New Year's Eve...probably the ideal time to visit it and it's 10, 000 lanterns. Have you seen our [Soultravelers3 Youtube video Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3?blend=2&ob=1 "soultravelers3 Youtube channel") where we showcased this temple? Please join us on Youtube if you haven't already as we have lots more videos coming soon.

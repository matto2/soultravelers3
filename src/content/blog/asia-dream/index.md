We went to [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/asia/ "Asia travel tips") for one reason and that was to get [Mandarin fluency](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "Fluent in Mandarin") and [literacy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "reading in 3 languages") for our [trilingual child,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html "trilingual child mozart - expert speaker, singer, traveler") plus a deep understanding of this part of our world. Deep Asian roots for my blond "non-Asian" 21st century child in our shrinking world.

That mission is now accomplished, so we are all very grateful for that and the many things learned in [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/asia/ "Asia travel tips") and amazing people we met and befriended. Some day we shall return, but not for a while likely.

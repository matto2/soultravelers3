If you want to get into that [holiday season](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/12/cut-your-own-christmas-tree-sustainable-family-fun-tradition.html "How to cut your own Christmas tree ") mood, watch [Mozart Dee sing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2017/11/mozart-dee-sings-on-born-this-way-tv-show-.html#more "Mozart Dee singer and actress") on [Good Day LA](http://www.foxla.com/good-day-la) with her prestigious National Children's Choir! She performed last week with Grammy-winning composer and conductor [Eric Whitacre](https://ericwhitacre.com) at the Walt Disney Concert Hall with the LA Master Chorale and will again this weekend.

She loves being in this choir and even sang at [Carnegie Hal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2016/05/15-year-old-mozart-sings-at-carnegie-hall-.html "Mozart Dee sings at Carnegie Hall")l with them in [NYC](http://soultravelers3new.local/2016/05/new-york-city-travel-for-teens-.html#more "teen travel in New York City"). They are preforming "Winter's Dream" at Royce Hall at UCLA on January 13th.   
  
One of the great things about having a singer/songwriter &  musician in the family, is all the beautiful Christmas music we hear now, so let me share a little with you. Here [Mozart sings](http://soultravelers3new.local/2017/05/16-year-old-mozart-dees-ted-talk-keynote-speech-in-ukteen-actress-songwriter-singer-mozart-dee-was-asked-to-do-a-ted-talk.html "Mozart sings & Ted Talk") "Santa Baby":

She loves to perform all year long, but even more so in this joyous season. Here is a Christmas Medley we did for Youtube from her many Holiday performances at Six Flags!

[Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2016/04/mozart-wins-best-actress-award-.html "Mozart Dee wins best actress award") has come a long way from those early preschool years singing as she cuts down the family Christmas tree and making up songs at four as she decorates the tree, ....to now working in an amazing 10,000 square foot recording studio with Grammy-winning producer Mikal Blue at Revolver Recordings preparing her debut EP that will be released soon!

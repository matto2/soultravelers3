She loves being in this choir and even sang at [Carnegie Hal](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2016/05/15-year-old-mozart-sings-at-carnegie-hall-.html "Mozart Dee sings at Carnegie Hall")l with them in [NYC](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2016/05/new-york-city-travel-for-teens-.html#more "teen travel in New York City"). They are preforming "Winter's Dream" at Royce Hall at UCLA on January 13th.

She loves to perform all year long, but even more so in this joyous season. Here is a Christmas Medley we did for Youtube from her many Holiday performances at Six Flags!

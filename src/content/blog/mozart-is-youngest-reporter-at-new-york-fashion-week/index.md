[Trilingual travel teen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "trilingual travel teen - most well traveled kid") Y[outuber Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "Youtuber Mozart at Soultravelers3 on youtube") was thriled to be asked to be the youngest reporter at [New York Fashion Week](http://mbfashionweek.com/ "New York Fashion Week")!  
  
Wow, what a lucky girl and another amazing [worldschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "worldschool or homeschooling or unschool") opportunity for [singer Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/06/mozart-sings-everything-we-are-original-song-supporting-environment.html "teen singer Mozart")... hitting the red carpet, getting insider tips backstage and killer interviews.

She [loves fashion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/08/cute-teen-clothes-shopping-haul.html "teen loves fashion, shopping, makeup") and she loves [New York](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/airbnb-best-budget-lodging-for-nyc.html "New york for cheap via airbnb"), so we jumped at the chance when the folks at [Not Your Mother's Haircare](http://www.nymbrands.com/ "Not your mother hair products") invited her after seeing [her first vlog on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un95ND8Uasc "Mozart's first vlog on Youtube")

I'm still shocked and delighted by the opportunities that come to us through social media. We live a blessed life and it makes my heart so full of gratitude for the beautiful people we attract.

Â What an enriching opportunity for a teen who already designs,creates and dreams of having her own clothing line some day.

Today she was at a vocal retreat at a gorgeous mansion with her voice/singing/performing Master's Class, tomorrow Mozart sings and plays keyboard at a gig in Dallas & Monday we head to New York City for a week of her reporting backstage and possibly getting interviewed herself on CNBC.  
  
( A reporter saw that we were going on Twitter and asked if we'd have time for an interview!).

We didn't have much time to plan or think about it, but when our friends from Twitter, [FlipKey](http://www.flipkey.com/ "Flipkey") sponsored us with a fantastic 2 bedroom apartment, we said yes!

We can always catch up on sleep later. No [Fashionista](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "fashionista - how to be stylish around the world") in her right mind would turn this down and we are in the mood for a wild adventure in the city that never sleeps ( and was my home in the seventies and eighties so I will sneak in some quick visits with old friends and maybe catch a Broadway show or two!).  
  
Stay tuned! What would you like to learn about Fashion Week?

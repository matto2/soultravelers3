Wow, what a lucky girl and another amazing [worldschool](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "worldschool or homeschooling or unschool") opportunity for [singer Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/06/mozart-sings-everything-we-are-original-song-supporting-environment.html "teen singer Mozart")... hitting the red carpet, getting insider tips backstage and killer interviews.

I'm still shocked and delighted by the opportunities that come to us through social media. We live a blessed life and it makes my heart so full of gratitude for the beautiful people we attract.

Â What an enriching opportunity for a teen who already designs,creates and dreams of having her own clothing line some day.

Today she was at a vocal retreat at a gorgeous mansion with her voice/singing/performing Master's Class, tomorrow Mozart sings and plays keyboard at a gig in Dallas & Monday we head to New York City for a week of her reporting backstage and possibly getting interviewed herself on CNBC.  
  
( A reporter saw that we were going on Twitter and asked if we'd have time for an interview!).

We didn't have much time to plan or think about it, but when our friends from Twitter, [FlipKey](http://www.flipkey.com/ "Flipkey") sponsored us with a fantastic 2 bedroom apartment, we said yes!

We can always catch up on sleep later. No [Fashionista](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "fashionista - how to be stylish around the world") in her right mind would turn this down and we are in the mood for a wild adventure in the city that never sleeps ( and was my home in the seventies and eighties so I will sneak in some quick visits with old friends and maybe catch a Broadway show or two!).  
  
Stay tuned! What would you like to learn about Fashion Week?

There is nothing like great books to enhance family travel! We loved the libraries in Scandinavia that all seem to also have a great selection of kid's books in English, which pleased seven year old Mozart to no end! This was a beautiful library  with lots of windows with gorgeous sea views in Finland in a tiny town on the [Aland islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85land_Islands) that we visited [last September.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photo-finland-aland-islands-pancakes.html)

[Books](http://boards.bootsnall.com/books-for-kids-that-travel-t40710.html) are the [cornerstone](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/kids-lit-itiner.html#more) of our [homeschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/mobile-mozart-a.html) and we are regulars at book shops and libraries on our family world travels. We also use digital libraries and gear [Mozart's reading](http://soultravelers3new.local/books_homeschool/) to our travels. I recently wrote homeschoolong posts for Christine at  Almost Fearless and Carmen at [Nunomad](http://www.nunomad.com/) and one of my primary goals this winter is to do a series of posts just on roadschooling.

I have already written [extensively](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/hanging-out-roa.html) on [this topic](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/pint-sized-pilg.html), but realize that I must add another category for those already written so that they will all be easier to find in one section. Now onto our fourth year of blogging, finding all the [relevant](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/sagres-henry-th.html) posts can sometimes be a challenge.

Our journey has convinced me that extended world travel combined with roadschooling, language immersion through a local school  and internet make for the best education today with the added benefit of the least cost and effort!

What specifics would you like to hear or see?

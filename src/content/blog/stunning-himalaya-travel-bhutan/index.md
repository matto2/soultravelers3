[Himalayas.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas "Himalayas").the very name is evocative. [Bhutan, land of the thunder dragon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan "Bhutan land of the thunder dragon"), is the last Himalayan kingdom, a Buddhist country with unique culture, exotic sacred architecture, biodiversity  and incredible beauty  like no other place on earth.  
  
This breathtaking Bhutan vista photo was taken as we drove the one road of the country, ( they've only had a road since the 1960's)  deep into Eastern Bhutan, the most isolated and sacred part ( and an arduous, slow journey).  
  
Many people have never even heard of Bhutan, although it is a often a coveted destination for [avid world travelers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "avid world travelers") due to it's uniqueness. We still have much to share about our recent [vacation in Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/travel-to-bhutan-.html "vacation in bhutan") and very proud to be the first travel bloggers to be invited there by the [Tourism Council of Bhutan](http://www.tourism.gov.bt/ "tourism council of Bhutan"). We were invited out of the blue and it's a place we might have missed on our world tour, so we are very grateful we didn't. Funny how life leads one where you need to be.  
  
We are happily haunted by our heavenly memories there and think [Bhutan is an amazing place for family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "bhutan amazing place for family travel") or [trekking the Tiger's Nest](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html "trekking the tigers nest, bhutan") or learning about a very different way of life. Bhutan has only been open to the world since the 1970's and one can not help wonder how it will change. I'd love to go back some day and experience more of it.  
  
A very long time ago someone told me that I had spent time in the angelic kingdom in the Himalayas, and I never thought about that again as I wasn't even sure what that meant. I never thought I'd see these mountains, but it came to mind again with this visit.  
  
I have been reading lots [about Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/bhutan-travel-mother-and-child-photo.html "about Bhutan") since our visit, thinking about the sweet people we met there. Did you know that if you want to see Bhutanese architecture in the USA you can in [El Paso, Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_El_Paso "el paso texas")? Here are a few posts I've written about this Himalayan paradise and fairy tale place.

When I get back to Asia I will be writing more and have tons of photos and video to share. What kinds of things would you like to know about Bhutan?

[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is about [seeing the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/around-the-world-with-kids-extended-travel-long-term-travel-families-and-friends.html) from other perspectives. Sometimes things like this road sign about a movie reminds us that we share [many languages on this planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language). One of our great joys of [our road trip around Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html) is the opportunity to [be exposed to so many languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330133ed07aec4970b) in a fairly compact area and learning some of each. Europe is one of the very best places to experience this and it's great for kids.

Although we are monolinguals who have raised a trilingual from birth,( with much effort)  we are grateful that our Mozart has been able to [immerse deeply in her Spanish in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330133ed07aec4970b), as we could never have given her the same [level of Spanish literacy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/last-day-of-sch.html) without that. She added quite a bit to her [French this summer in France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html) and we look forward to her immersing deeply in her Mandarin in Asia soon.We loved our time in [Slovenia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/family-travel-slovenia-country-side-adventures-with-family-on-a-road-trip-in-europe.html) including time in [Lake Bled](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/beautiful-lake.html) and [Ljublijana](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/lovely-ljublija.html)

What do you see as the advantages of [knowing other languages or at least being exposed](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/funniest-kids-soultravelers3-family-travel-best-funny-youtube-global-kids-hilarious-sweden-trumpet-v.html) to them?

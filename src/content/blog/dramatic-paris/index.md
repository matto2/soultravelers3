[Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/paris-bois-de-b.html "Paris"), "The City of Light, ( La Ville-Lumiere) is amazing when the sun is out and the temperature is just right and we've been blessed to experience it many times at it's best. Sublime. But like London and most of northern Europe, it's not known for it's great weather.  
  
We've frozen in both [London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html "London") and Paris in July and August where we could have sworn it was winter and one can usually feel the big difference in weather when you drive up from [Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/family-travel-provence-france-narbonne.html "Provence") and you hit a certain point where the sun disappears.  
  
Nevertheless, [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/goodbye-paris.html "Paris family travel") can be charming in rain, clouds and bad weather as this dramatic photo shows. I love the sunny days best, but I find it always a pleasure to just walk around this beautiful city no matter what the weather hands us.

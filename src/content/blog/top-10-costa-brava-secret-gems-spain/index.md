The best way to experience the beauty of "the wild coast" just north of Barcelona is to skip the package tour hell and high rise resorts, and get on the tiny roads that lead to places hard to build on due to nature's stunning cliffs. Just like the over development that has ruined much of the [Costa Blanca,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Blanca) [Costa Del Sol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_del_Sol) and so many of the spectacularly beautiful coasts of Spain, [Costa Brava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Brava) has also been plagued by [such](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloret_de_Mar). If you have a beautiful coast somewhere, it seems everyone wants a piece of it.

It is not that these places are so hard to find, but most visitors don't look as many are satisfied to never leave their resort and come just for sun holidays. Most who come to Barcelona, miss these great jewels, many are just a little over an hour away. Even in high season, we knew most of these secret hideaways would not be crowded and didn't book anything ahead. There are still wonderful, hidden delights, beaches & pretty postcard perfect villages to be found on all of these coasts. One just has to look and have a desire to find the authentic beauty that is far from the crowds.

We have enjoyed some of [Costa Brava](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/espana-costa-br.html) before ( including [Dali's amazing museum](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/dali-musee-hot.html)), but rented a small car this fourth of July week, to dig deeper for beauty and unique experiences. We were not disappointed!

Our motor home is too heavy to get into some of these tiny spots that we were interested in seeing and we prefer skipping curvy, hilly roads in it, if at all possible. We carry a lot more in our RV than most (lots of  books, can goods and full digital piano weigh us down) so vertiginous  mountain roads are not our favorite, although we did see some RV's in some of the places we went to. We could have done many in our RV, but the 30-euro-a-day little rent-a-car granted us more leeway.

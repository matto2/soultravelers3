A  recent survey showed that 80% of Baby Boomers hoped to travel when they retire and many polls rank travel as the number one leisure activity for this age range.

If you dream about [retiring early and perpetual travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retire early and perpetual travel"), just know this IS a very doable dream for most ordinary folks and you can find a travel style that works for you.

Who doesn't like chocolate? Did you know it was VERY easy to make this super delicious, healthy chocolate [ice cream](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/05/easy-healthy-homemade-ice-cream-no-machine-.html "easy healthy ice cream recipe"), even without an ice cream machine? We make ice cream almost every weekend out of [coconu](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconut super food")t milk as we enjoy our [long term travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/long-term-family-travel-most-important-item.html "long term travel lifestyle") treats in [tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/02/escaping-winter-in-tropical-asia.html "tropical Asia").  
  
In my recent  [father-daughter relationship](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/-father-daughter-relationships.html "father- daughter relationship ")  post, I first told about making this chocolate ice cream recipe along with the [paleo pizza](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/best-paleo-pizza-recipe.html "paleo pizza") and [banana bread](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/08/healthy-banana-bread-recipe-paleogapsgluten-free.html "healthy banana bread recipe gluten free paleo Gaps") when we celebrated DaVinci's 60th birthday. It was a BIG hit while allowing us to stay on our grain free, sugar free food on our [cavity prevention and curing diet](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "how to cure cavities and gum disease") during our [healing journey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "healing journey").   
  
The first photo shows it served with the banana bread, sliced bananas and a few walnuts. YUM!  
We don't have chocolate  often, because we  [avoid phytic acid](http://www.westonaprice.org/food-features/living-with-phytic-acid "avoid phytic acid") ( alas even raw organic Cacao powder has it) and even curtail our raw organic honey to minute amounts...but it is perfect for a special occasion, so savored!

But life is more fun with a little chocolate indulgence and this delectable ice cream fits that bill!

It doesn't have the airy texture, but we just let it melt a little and enjoy every bite! Sure beats the [antifreeze and other toxins found in most ice cream](http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/antifreeze-in-your-ice-cream-2/ "antifreeze in ice cream") you buy.  
  
What is your favorite ice cream?

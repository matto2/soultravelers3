After a sauna and the most scrumptious organic breakfast, which we savored leisurely while taking in the awe-inspiring mountain and lake views, Mozart decided that she had to investigate it even closer.

We now know why  [National Geographic Traveler Magazine](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0511/trips/adventure_travel_north.html) named the fijords in Norway, "the best unspoiled travel destination in the world" and why they are on  [Hillman's list of Top 100 Wonders of the World](http://www.hillmanwonders.com/). We found the fjords perfect for family travel!

We will be writing more about our thrilling adventures of exploring this [World Heritage Site  fjord area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sognefjord) of  Norway on our own via trains and boats, but thought we would start with this photo. In that calm of a new morning, with no one around, Mozart enjoyed skipping rocks and running wild to greet the day in this spectacular setting on Lake Vangsvatnet .

We had left our [RV in Oslo](http://www.virtualtourist.com/hotels/Europe/Norway/Oslo_Region/Oslo-214570/Hotels_and_Accommodations-Oslo-Bogstad_Camp_Turistsenter-BR-1.html "campsite review")  and took trains to the western part of Norway where the fjords are, so we stayed at one of our [first hostels](http://www.hostelbookers.com/hostels/norway/voss/9124/ "fjord hostel in Voss"), which just happens to be one of the nicest in Norway. We did not book either in advance since we were just "winging" this trip as we went. Summer and the tourist season ends on August 15th in Scandinavia and we were there in September when the summer crowds are gone and winter crowds have not arrived.

This picture was taken right on the hostel grounds just a few feet from where we ate and slept. We had a private family room which was big,  adequate, but certainly not a cheap option ( although a little cheaper than the nearby hotels). The room was not lush, but  the place was lovely, in an idyllic setting and we met  some friendly people from many countries.  Norway is the most expensive country in Europe, so we did not linger ( like we could in Sweden by staying with friends) but we were very glad we did not miss this glorious fjord countryside!

I know, I am behind on my schedule again, as I come to the blaring conclusion once more, that what I think  can get done in a day, seems to have no bearing on reality. We are becoming so popular that social media, interviews, radio shows, writing assignments, taking our disadvantaged kids with us virtually and just trying to stay up with emails eats up all my spare time.

I am looking into finding interns and volunteers to help, so please let me know if you are interested ( leave a message in the comments or our contact number).I need to delegate some of this! I am trying to work out some kind of win-win arrangement.

Don't miss our latest interview with [Andrew Warner](http://twitter.com/AndrewWarner?page=1) on the cool site  [Mixergy](http://blog.mixergy.com/nomad-family/#disqus_thread) about our lives as digital nomads. You will find lots of great interviews there and we are honored to be amongst some amazing renown innovators like [Tim Ferriss](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/),  [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) and [Jason Calacanis!](http://calacanis.com/) Who knew we would be with "web visionaries"?

Please don't forget to vote for all 3 of our nominations for [Lonely Planet Travel Awards](http://lplabs.com/2009/02/25/voting-open-for-the-2009-travel-blogger-awards/ "VOTE! ") as the voting continues until March 20th, so tell all your friends! We really appreciate all the votes we have gotten soooo much!  It is a very tight race in every category because of their prestigious name in travel, so each one counts.

I'll post this on [Deliciousbaby's Photo Friday](http://www.deliciousbaby.com/) where you can see lots of fun travel photos!

Have you taken a [ride in a rickshaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickshaw "rickshaw")? It's a popular option in [Georgetown, Penang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town,_Penang "Georgetown, penang , malaysia") in Malaysia and adds to the atmosphere of this UNESCO Heritage Site and seems especially rewarding for family travel whileÂ  learning about the history here. We enjoy looking at them and taking photos, but we have yet to take a ride in one since we have been [wintering in Penang.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "wintering in Penang")

Even though it is a tricycle style rickshaw, I still worry about the person giving the ride, but perhaps we will try it out with [Grandma and Mozart doing intergenerational family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "Intergenerational family travel") on our touristy jaunts and explorations around Georgetown during Chinese New Year.

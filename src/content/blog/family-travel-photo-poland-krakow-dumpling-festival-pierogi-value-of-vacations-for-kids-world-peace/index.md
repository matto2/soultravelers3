One of the great values of family travel  
is how it keeps you connected to all  
the people and places that you visit

One of the great values of [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is how it keeps you connected to all the people and places that you visit. One becomes a [citizen of the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html#more) and you feel related to everyone. When an [earthquake hit Haiti,](http://matadorchange.com/what-you-can-do-to-help-haiti) I thought of my visit there long ago and the people that touched me. When [one hit Chile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aA7mFDGMEA), I thought of all of our friends in South America and when I visited that continent long ago. When [protests caused deaths in Thailand](http://legalnomads.blogspot.com/2010/04/deadly-protests-in-bangkok.html), we thought of our friends there and our plans to visit there later this year. 

We feel their pain more deeply now that the whole world belongs to us. [Travel and the internet](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/twitter-travel-20.html) makes the world smaller today. This is a good thing and we can help each other and lift higher together.

[This week](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/04/12/russia.crash.scene/index.html) our hearts are with our friends [mourning in Poland](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/04/poland_in_mourning.html) and we send them our prayers. We remember happier times, like this fun photo taken at the Dumpling Festival ( pierogi) i[n Krakow](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-cool-krakow-bb-poland-best-budget-hotel.html) that was populated primarily by locals. We hope the healing comes quickly, thoroughly and more happy days arrive soon. This is our small tribute to the strength, perseverance and joy of the Polish people. Always keep your eyes on the good!

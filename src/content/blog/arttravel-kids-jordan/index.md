Did you know that adding colored pencils and paper to your day pack when you [travel with kids](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "travel with kids"), can add a lot of enjoyment, [educational value to your family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "family travel education value"), and the best [family vacation souvenirs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/family-travel-scotland-edinburgh-funny-sign-souvenir-shop-edinburgh-festival-camping.html "family vacation souvenirs")?  
  
Art has added so much to our open-ended, [family world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "family world tour") that we have been taking for the last five years. Not only just seeing it, likeÂ  in [museums in Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/madeline-linea.html "museums in paris"), or the [Uffitzi in Florence](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/the-uffitzi.html "uffitzi in florence"), [Met in NYC](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/family-travel-photo-nyc-usa-metropolitan-museum-of-art-egyptian.html "Metropolitan Art museum New York City with kids"), or [Guggenheim](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/wow-guggenheim-bilbao-.html "guggenheim museum bilbao family vacation") and [Dali museums](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/dali-musee-hot.html "Dali museum in spain travel vacation") in Spain or [prehistoric art in caves in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/11/altamira-sistin.html "prehistoric art altamira ") and France ( see my [tips for museums with kids](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html "best tips museums with kids")).

But also by watching artists at work like the [Byzantine artist in Crete](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/06/byzantine-art.html "byzantine art in Crete"), spinning [clay in Cappadocia cave](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/making-pottery.html "pottery in cappadocia, turkey in cave"), the many fascinating [hand-made craft workes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/made-by-hand.html "best hand made crafts art in Morocco") in Morocco, [Art and Calligraphy in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "stunning photos asia"), the [pottery and lacemakers in Galicia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/10/lace-pottery-in.html "pottery and lace in Galicia") , weavers in [Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "bhutan vacation") and many other such opportunities. We often buy art that we see made and get a picture with the artist who made it, just as we appreciate [street artists](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/11/prague-at-night.html "street artist in Prague") as we roam and contribute to them for what they give to us.

Plus visiting a famous artist's home like [Giverny and Monet's Garden](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/giverny-monets.html "visiting Giverny Monet's garden family vacation france") or [Dali's and his wife's,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/top-10-costa-brava-secret-gems-spain.html "costa brava gems like Dali houses") after getting to know their work well in [museums around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/3-museums-in-a.html "museums around the world with kids") and [books adds educational value](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "education and travel homeschool books") and dimension  
  
Perhaps though, one of the top ways is through the [child's own art expression](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/02/kids-art-creativity-travel-family-friendly-travel-education-homeschool-roadschool-.html "child's art expression") like when our 7 year old child drew this Unesco World Heritage site spontaneously in Portugal:

Recenly we [traveled to Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "travel to jordan is safe") and [visited Petra with camel rides](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "petra jordan family vacation ") which were highlights for our ten year old daughter Mozart. We love this drawing she did about her [experiences in Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "travel experiences in Jordan") and plan to frame it and keep it forever. We're proud of our ten year old artist and know that the art lesson and result just solidifies and adds to our happy memories forever.  
  
How does art affect your travels?

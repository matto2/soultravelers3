We are doing a month long road trip in [Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/croatia/) and then onto [Montenegro](http://soultravelers3new.local/montenegro/), as you may have noticed on our [soultravelers3 Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/soultravelers.3/) or my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/soultravelers3/). Check out those sources or my old posts ( like [Heavenly](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com) doing her [film debut in Rovinj at 7](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/mozarts-film-de.html?fbclid=IwAR1Ypb4Po1DSuYZhR0ao59sgQxHghYFCJ0oXjGpKMQBALEgtDCTXRldEr3Q)) as Croatia is a gorgeous country that we love a lot.

We are moving a LOT faster than normal [digital nomad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/09/vacation-vs-full-time-travel-digital-nomad-lifestyle.html#more) pace, so I can only do short posts, but I keep up daily on facebook and IG! We are seeing many new things that we missed on our last long trip and the weather has been perfect, so there is much to tell and show...from Roman ruins, to beautiful fall vineyards, to glorious beaches & incredible towns!

I will go into a lot more detail soon as we think both of these countries are gems that too many Americans miss & they are also great for digital nomads, vanlifes  and worldschoolers.

Sending you peace & love vibes from gorgeous Croatia and I can't wait to share more photos, videos and information about all that we are discovering and enjoying!

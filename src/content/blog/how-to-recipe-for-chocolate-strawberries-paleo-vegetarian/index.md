**TOO MANY LIES WITH OUR FOOD SUPPLY**  
  
One of my pet peeves is how hard it is to decipher if something is REALLY healthy or not. Things like [raw honey](http://www.foodrenegade.com/your-honey-isnt-honey/ "raw honey vs fake honey"), [olive oil](http://draxe.com/fake-olive-oil/ "fake olive oil"), [sweet potatoes](http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/12/03/a-little-girls-project-shows-us-why-we-need-to-choose-organic-produce/ "sweet potatoes"), [salmon](http://paleoleap.com/two-faces-salmon/ "salmon ") etc are often not what they seem and one has to look so hard, research endlessly, delve into labels, especially tiny print and understand misleading labeling laws, even talk to the farmers. Big Food makes out, Big Pharma makes out; we all pay the price.  
  
**FOOD CHAIN AND AVOIDING INDUSTRIAL CONVENTIONAL FOODS**  
  
What goes into your food ( pesticides, GMO etc) or animal products you eat ( [raw eggs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/raw-eggs-healthy-or-not.html "raw eggs"), [raw milk](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/04/raw-milk-fast-and-cure.html "raw milk"), grass-fed beef, pastured butter etc) makes a huge difference in one's long term health. Read this  [FR EE book](http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/price/pricetoc.html "weston price free book - Nutrition and physical degeneration") if you want to learn more and see photos that prove it.  
  
**EAT REAL FOOD**  
  
[Sugar kills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM "sugar kills"), ( and it's not just in sweets but tons in EVERYTHING from ketchup to salad dressings), [process foods kill](http://authoritynutrition.com/9-ways-that-processed-foods-are-killing-people/ "process foods kill") , [vegetable oils kill,](http://wellnessmama.com/2193/why-you-should-never-eat-vegetable-oil-or-margarine/ "vegetable oils kill ") [grains harm.  
](http://wellnessmama.com/3486/do-you-have-a-wheat-belly-interview-with-dr-davis/ "grains harm")

**YUM!**  **SWEET AND HEALTHY**  
  
Let's get back to the chocolate goodness! This is a fun and easy project for the whole family. We did this for Valentine's Day and my birthday here in our [short stay hotel in Dallas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2014/02/best-extended-stay-hotel-in-dallas-hawthorn-suites-addison-galleria.html "SHORT STAY HOTEL DALLAS - HAWTHORN SUITES").

**ORGANIC STRAWBERRIES CHOCOLATE DIPPED HEALTHY**  
  
We got some delicious, organic strawberries on sale.  
  
Remember that [Best Chocolate Paleo Cake Recipe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/10/best-chocolate-cake-recipe-ever-and-its-paleo-healthy-grain-free.html "BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE PALEO GRAIN-FREE RECIPE")? I just used that easy and VERY quick recipe for the chocolate part to dip the strawberries.  ( Not the cake, just the frosting)

**QUICK, EASY, TAKES 30 SECONDS TO MAKE DELISH, HEALTHY RAW CHOCOLATE**  
  
 I tend to "play" with my recipes a little. Do  a taste test and tweak it to your liking.  
  
I am a big believer in this quote by Julia Child:  
  
"With enough butter, anything is good"  
  
I think the butter is what makes this chocolate recipe so yummy.  
  
We use this recipe hard or soft in many ways as it's an easy chocolate treat that can't be beat.  We only use [raw, unfiltered honey](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/is-honey-a-safer-sweetener/#axzz2wA9e51bW "RAW HONEY") never heated above 93F (and sparingly at that) as we try to keep our [fructose low.](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/06/19/richard-johnson-interview-may-18-2010.aspx "FRUCTOSE") 

With enough butter, anything is good.

 **USE FRIDGE OR FREEZER TO HARDEN CHOCOLATE**  
  
We did it after dinner and just dipped the strawberries right into the blender by their green tops, then put them on plates.  
  
We put it in the freezer for a few minutes to harden the chocolate. This can be done in the fridge if you don't do it last minute like I did.  
  
**VARIATION**  
  
Another even quicker variation is just put the chocolate into cups and do individual self dips with strawberrys or bananas or a combo of fruit you love to mix with chocolate. Kind of like family chocolate finger fondue which goes nicely as a family-night movie treat.  
  
**FINDING BEST FARMERS FOR FOOD**  
  
That is my ice cream in the white bowl next to it in the fridge, these days I am making it with [raw milk](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/04/raw-milk-fast-and-cure.html "RAW MILK") instead of coconut milk because the coconut milk is so much fresher and cheaper in Asia.  
  
As usual, we have met some great sustainable farmers here who are very concientious about the food they raise and grow. You can see my whole pastured chickens and grass fed beef in the freezer.

 “You don't have to cook fancy or complicated masterpieces - just good food from fresh ingredients.” -Julia Child  
  
We do healthy desserts as special occasions and we are happy to add this one to our list.  
  
I've got some great pastured chicken liver pate and chile recipes coming, since now we can get them here and couldn't before. Nutrient dense healing foods that are delectable and easy, rock!  
  
Who is in the mood for a chocolate covered strawberry?

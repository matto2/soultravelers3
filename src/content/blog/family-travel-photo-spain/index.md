Family Travel is all about having new experiences and today was one for the books in Andalusia, Spain! It snowed! We almost fell over when we all went out side to go to my physical therapist and lo and behold it was snowing outside! We have been [here four winters](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/spain/index.html) in this little micro-climate near the sea and have never seen anything like it. We had to get a photo record of it sticking to our 9 year old's hair.

Mozart was gleeful and wanting to make a snowman, but of course it was all long gone within minutes and our sun was back. It did add a little thrill to our day, but I'm ready for our warm temperatures to come back too as suddenly it was unusually cold here today. There [is usually snow at the top](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/01/white-xmas-sort.html) of the [nearby Sierra Nevada mountains](http://twitpic.com/25ux7), but usually warm here.

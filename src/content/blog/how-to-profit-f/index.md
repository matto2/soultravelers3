How to Profit From the Coming Real Estate Bust  
This book was one of the key books that opened our eyes to the coming real estate bust and how to profit from it. I had never heard of Rubino at that point, long before we decided to put our home on the market and take our extended trip around the world. I just picked it at random off the shelf, years ago when I was doing research in this area out of curiosity. Still, it made lots of sense to us, even though we read it first several years ago when real estate was booming to record levels in our area. It is amazing to see how accurate this book was and still provides good information. We continue to reread it and are glad we brought it with us in our limited travel library.

Do you love salsa? How would you like to make a very easy, super healthy salsa that your whole family will love? I was surprised to learn that salsa is the number one condiment in America. Since we LOVE [Mexican food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/mexican-food-around-the-world-make-your-own.html "Mexican food around the world") , we eat salsa a lot, often with pastured eggs for breakfast, as a snack or with lunch or dinner, so want the most healthy version.

**WHY MAKE AND EAT FERMENTED SALSA**  
  
With today's food and constant assaults to our digestion system ( antibiotics, medicines, chlorinated water, birth control pills etc) we ALL need more probiotics, perhaps even more so for those wanting to combine [health and travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html#more "health  and travel").  
  
Our gut health is essential to ensure overall health and optimal wellness as all disease begins in the gut which makes up 80% of our immune system. A robust immune system is the number one defense system against ALL disease, thus one of our [travel health secrets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health secrets") now.

Lacto-fermented foods are one of the easiest, most simple and worthwhile ways of adding vitamins, enzymes and probiotics to your diet. It is an ancient method that has been around for centuries in all traditional cultures primarily to preserve food over long periods of time when there is no refrigeration.  
  
**MULTIPLE HEATH BENEFITS OF FERMENTED FOOD**  
  
_“The proliferation of lactobacilli in fermented vegetables enhances their digestibility and increases vitamin levels. These beneficial organisms produce numerous helpful enzymes as well as antibiotic and anticarcinogenic substances. Their main by-product, lactic acid, not only keeps vegetables and fruits in a state of perfect preservation but also promotes the growth of healthy flora throughout the intestine.” Sally Fallon in Nourishing Traditions_  
  
**GUT HEALTH AND FERMENTED FOOD**  
  
_"It’s because about 85 percent of our immune system is located in the gut wall. This fact has been established by basic physiology research in the 1930s and the 1940s. Your gut, your digestive wall, is the biggest and the most important immune organ in your body. There is a very tight conversation and a relationship going on between the gut flora that lives inside your digestive system, and your immune system..._

_Your gut flora—the state of the gut flora and the composition of microbes in your gut flora—has a profound effect on what forms of immune cells you will be producing on any given day, what they’re going to be doing, and how balanced your immune system is.” Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride M.D._

**SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND FERMENTED FOOD**  
  
_"For years, these claims of healthful effects from **fermented foods** were considered unscientific folklore. However, a substantial, and growing, body of scientific evidence has now demonstrated that lactobacilli and **fermented foods** play a significant role in human health.."_  
_\- Michael T. Murray, ND_  
  
**PROMOTE HEALTH, REDUCE STRESS  AND PREVENT DISEASE**  
  
_There is a good case for recommending probiotics, either in **fermented foods** or as supplements, every single day to promote health and prevent disease. It certainly worked for the Bulgarians. The case is even stronger for the elderly since the amount of colonic bacteria decreases with age. The same is probably true for those under continuous stress. In animal studies, probiotics have been shown to help reduce the symptoms of stress when animals are transported—so if you're a stressed-out commuter they may help you too!"_  
  
_\- Patrick Holford_  
  
**FERMENTED FOODS AND DECREASING DEGENERATIVE DISEASES**  
  
_"Almost all naturally **fermented foods** are health promoting. The healthy bacteria lactobacilli are heavily involved in the fermentation process, and a potent source of these healthy "probiotics." Various members of the lactobacillus class of healthy bacteria have been found to support and improve immunity in a number of studies. They help control inflammation, which is an essential feature of so many degenerative diseases, including heart disease. And on top of that, they're essential in maintaining a healthy digestive system."_

YUM!! Here we used it on a meal with soaked brown rice, soaked pinto beans, homemade tortillas with soaked flour, lacto-fermented guacamole and avocados! It is cheaper, best tasting and so much healthier than store bought and our whole family loves the taste.  
  
Have you tried fermented salsa yet?

What young teen doesn't dream about a limousine ride and being a bit spoiled by first class luxuries? This is the kind of thing one reads about in books, or sees in movies, but don't really expect in life (certainly not a [travel lifestyle family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html#more "world travel nomadic RTW family") that lives on $23/day per person around the world), so our just-turned-12 year old was euphoric to have this opportunity (thanks to the [Four Seasons Hotel in Beijing](http://www.fourseasons.com/beijing/ "four seasons hotel beijing") who sponsored us).  
  
Talk about arriving in style and going first class! After a 12 hour travel day and arriving after midnight, it certainly perked us all up to first see the bright [lights of Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/real-beijing-hutong-nights.html "beijing night life") on our [first trip to China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/getting-a-tourism-visa-for-china-adventure.html "first trip to China") in the comfort of a brand new limousine.  
  
This is a kid who has taken buses, taxi's, RV's, horses, camels, sail boats, cargo ships, trains, funiculars, cars, bikes, cable cars, subways, scooters and more on 5 continents and 45 countries...but this was her very first limo ride and that was super exciting for her.  
  
I love it that she can have the whole range of experiences from sleeping in a Berber tent deep [in the Sahara deser](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/12/sahara-dream.html "sahara desert dream trip  with kids")t at 6 to riding a limo in China at 12 and staying at the best luxury hotels as well as staying with locals in China.  
  
By the way, here in Penang at her [Chinese school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "learning chinese in Asia"), they begin the school year in January and she likes it that she is already considered a "13" here because she will turn 13 in 2013....even if it won't be until the fall. So she says from that definition, she is not a tween, but a teen!  
  
How old were you when you took your first fancy limousine ride?

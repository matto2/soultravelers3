I never knew that tea and travel was such a perfect mix: from [High Tea in London with kids;](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/high-tea-in-london-with-kids.html "high tea in london with kids") to the [Chinese Tea Ceremony](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/chines.html "Chinese tea ceremony") at my child's [Mandarin school in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin school in Penang") ; to a [tea break in Wadi Rum](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/wadi-rum-jordan.html "tea break in wadi Rum, jordan"), Jordan; to sharing a "cuppa" at the [oldest tea house in Shanghai](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/shanghai-with-kids.html "shanghai with kids - tea house") surrounded by water and on a [gulet sailboat in Turkey.,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/sailing-away.html "sailboat gulet in turkey travel") plus much, much more of course.  
  
I am one of those odd creatures that never drank coffee or tea, but we have all grown more fond of tea and the art of tea drinking, as well as the [health](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "health and travel") and social aspects, as we have [traveled the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "traveled the world") these last 7 1/2 years.  
  
I think it all started for us in [Morocco](http://soultravelers3new.local/morocco/ "Morocco"), as my then 6 year old daughter fell in love with the mint tea that they served everywhere, but nothing is quite like sipping it in the [Sahara](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html "Sahara desert travel camel overnight")! This photo was taken in Jordan at the [Dead Sea at the beautiful Movenpick Hotel](http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/hotels_resorts/worldmap/dead_sea/welcome.cfm "Movenpick dead sea resort and spa") where we enjoyed lots of tea and great hospitality.  
  
We had some amazing tea experiences in [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "China travel") that I will telling you about soon.

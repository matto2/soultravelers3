Birthdays While Traveling  
  
Have you ever celebrated  
a birthday abroad? Since  
we live a travel lifestyle

Have you ever celebrated a birthday abroad? Since we live a [lifestyle of non-stop family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "lifestyle of non-stop family travel"), our child has had some amazing travel birthday celebrations starting at 5 with her [good bye pajama party](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/suite-bon-voyag.html "good bye pajama party") in 2006 at a hotel. We even helped her identify exactly what [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "world travel") was by planning her 6th [birthday in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html "birthday in paris") before we left. Who knew we were starting a trend? A [permanent vacation life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "permanent vacation") has many perks.  
  
She celebrated her 7th [birthday in Salazburg](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/super-7-salzbur.html "birthday in salzburg"), ( and [Dalmation coast](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/dalmatia-coast.html "dalmation coast"))  her [8th birthday in Stockholm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html "8th birthday in stockholm"), her 9th [birthday in London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html "birthday in london"), her 10th [birthday in Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "birthday in barcelona") and very recently her 11th birthday at [Harry Potter's Wizarding World](http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/ "harry potter's wizarding world") at [Universal in Orlando Florida](http://www.universalorlando.com/home/home.aspx "Universal orlando") that I will be writing  about soon!  
  
Because [friends are  important with travel for a kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html#more "friends important for travel kid"), she also sometimes gets several celebrations. Like she did in [southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "southern spain road trip"), since we were never there on her birthday and before we left Barcelona this year she had a wonderful celebration with her best friend there. ( As you can see in this photo). We've had a few [celebrations in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "celebrations in paris"), but with our lifestyle, every day often feels like a celebration, so it takea  little imagination to add a special flair.  
  
She conned me into making another treasure hunt for them around our huge campsite and we all enjoyed a take out dinner together. She lucked out like a bandit with gifts from her friend ( she gave her some too), from our German friends here, her teen age Dutch buddy councilor  from the kids club and free ice cream for both of them from the guy who runs the snack bar.

Have you ever celebrated a birthday on the road? How do you celebrate birthdays while [traveling with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "traveling with kids")?

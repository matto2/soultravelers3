One of the great advantages of having [local friends in Barcelona who are "foodies"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=99t-NPNCipE "Barcelona local friends foodies") is we get to eat fabulous foodÂ  at great prices and learn more about the food and culture of Spain and [Catalan cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_cuisine "Catalan cuisine"). They speak both Spanish and Catalan which helps immensely in Barcelona.  
  
These snails are called "Cargols a la llauna" and taste quite different than the escargot that one eats in France and they are served in a very different way as well. Mozart ate her first snails as escargot in a fancy restaurant in France when she was 5 and we began our world travel, so gobbling these up with her Spanish best friend came naturally to her.

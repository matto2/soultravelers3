The longer we stay here the more we  
discover and the deeper the enchantment  
seeps into our consciousness.

The longer we stay here the more we discover and the deeper the enchantment seeps into our consciousness. It is not just the beauty that we keep seeing in greater depth and in more abstract and subtle ways, but the also in the sweetness of the people here. Today we had a delightful conversation with a very young 82 year old man who has lived here all his life. It makes me wish that we could spend months in every place we like as the value of time adds such richness.

I was a little frustrated this morning with some bad news from home and then our stove was out of gas and various other thing, so I was feeling a little grouchy and out of sorts. But it was a good excuse to go out to eat and  as soon as we went outside into our little village, things changed as there really is magic here.

We are still discovering new things and just walking around in this unique beauty can’t help but lighten one’s mood. We discovered several new restaurants today in our roam around town and I hope we can get to all of the restaurants here before we set off in April for our 7 months on the road.

We were going to go to one of our favorites, but it was already closed so we just wondered around and ended up going to the very top of the village where I have been wanting to go. It was a little late in the day, so I missed the best light, but it still was spectacular and I want to go back and take some more pictures.

Mozart tells me not to take my camera because people will think I am a tourist, but I don’t care as I  
always find new things to shoot. The hardest thing to shoot is the people of the village, especially because now I am one of them. Still I have a little collection coming along, as catching them just being themselves attracts me. I have been collecting doors, windows and door knockers too and lots of interesting architectural details. There is simply endless material to capture in this one little village and I guess that surprises me. One of these days I will sort thru my albums and get them up, but these days I am busy preparing our next leg of the tour.

The food was scrumptious at this new restaurant and the view was to die for with the most sublime flamenco music. It was the yummiest sangria yet,  made with the local wine (which we are growing quite fond of) which certainly added to the “feel good” buzz. We have not had any since last weeks street party, but it has moved DaVinci from having the popular San Miguel “cervesa” (beer) to drink with dinner, to a “letro” ( liter pitcher) of Sangria that we share together.

DaVinci probably got the best dish as it was a kebob with some exotic sauces on the side with melt in your mouth beef from Argentina. The waiter (who probably was the owner) was superb and charming, talking in several languages to the various tables of guests. It was a bit pricey, so we hesitated at first whether to stay or not, but now we will be back.

After leaving the restaurant, there was a little viewing area nearby which Mozart decided was a good place to play hide and seek with her Dad, while I took a few shots like the one above. That is where we met the octogenarian who has always lived at the top of this village and sees this view every day. DaVinci’s dad turns 80 next month and my mom turns 80 next January, so octogenarians are on our mind and it was interesting to get his perspective.

So it turned out to be another sweet day in southern Spain. Again, nothing spectacular, but village life just keeps soaking into our American souls. As my six year old child writhes to the haunting sounds of the soulful flamenco singers in a very Andalusian way; as our taste buds adapt to the “sherry-like” flavor of the sangria; and our eyes find the looming mountains, sugar cube houses and sea familiar as “home”; I find us transforming, not unlike Spiderman in a molecular way, into something quite different than when we arrived. Ah, the luxury of time in a place of value and how that can impact.

In honor of Earth Day, I thought this nature collage that Mozart did spontaneously while playing in [Plitvice Park in Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/peaceful-pretty.html) captures the spirit! She loves to make such things in her play and they remind us a bit of [Andy Goldsworthy's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Goldsworthy) wonderful [art that we love](http://images.google.es/images?q=andy+goldsworthy&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=O_fuSYnIG8WMjAfSwKUb&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&resnum=4&ct=title).

We are grateful that our family travel lifestyle allows her so much time in nature and how she finds ways to play with it and make beauty out of natural elements. Some of the [latest studies](http://www.peecworks.org/PEEC/PEEC_Research/S0009D4F0-0009D4F1) about [how important](http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/2008/02/13/why-kids-need-a-big-dose-of-nature.html) it is for children (and all of us) to be [more connected with nature](http://www.utne.com/2003-11-01/HowNatureHealsUs.aspx), are interesting to read.

I know I really appreciate the experience of camping and how it gives me even more time in nature than when we are living in our winter home. We do go out in nature a lot while in the home as we are right on the edge of the country side and walk to everything we need. Still, when we are in the RV we are even more in nature and that is something I have really come to appreciate. I love that Mozart gets to do most of her [homeschool outside in nature](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/hanging-out-roa.html)!

 Even when we are in cities, we are parked in a rural area, so we wake up to trees, bird singing and a more earthy reality as we pop out of bed and walk to the bathrooms or showers. The kid in me, loves that half- awake-and-in-my-pajamas perspective of a new day outside in nature and munching our breakfast together in the morning sunlight under trees. I never fully realized it would be one of the benefits of our world tour!

We are now packing up as we start our transition to our 7 months of travel on the road, so you can probably feel my excitement growing. We will be going slow this year and Portugal (returning to swim with dolphins), Barcelona, Sardenia, Corsica, Italy, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Switzerland are all on the list.  
I got sick recently, so we are postponing our Egypt, Jordan and Israel trip until this fall.

I wrote a short note about Earth Day for my friend Darren in England on his popular blog [Travelrants](http://www.travel-rants.com/), so will post it here too:

This [Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/hubs/greentravel/3448029/Responsible-Tourism-Awards-Green-getaways-in-lean-times.html) says "Responsible tourism is about“ making better places to live in, better places to visit.” As a world traveling family, we love that idea!

" [9 Tips on How to Travel Greener](http://www.bootsnall.com/articles/09-01/9-tips-how-travel-greener.html)" helps us all focus on how to travel greener. Interestingly, slow travel is also much, much cheaper than fast travel, so helpful in this economy. We traveled to 4 continents, 29 countries and only took one long airplane flight!

I know [cruise ships](http://www.aboutmyplanet.com/conspiracies/cruise-ships-trail/) are popular, but [they are](http://www.marbef.org/wiki/Impact_of_tourism_in_coastal_areas:_Need_of_sustainable_tourism_strategy) the [most harmful toursim to our environment](http://blog.wholetravel.com/2008/08/05/when-it-comes-to-sustainable-travel-steer-clear-of-cruising/). We have seen the [massive cruise ship invasions](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/738862/Are-cruise-destinations-overcrowded.html) of 30,000 people at once into  [small towns](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/catching-capri.html) like Dubrovnik and [Mykonos](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/mykonos-town.html). It reminds me of the Asian Proverb; "Tourism is a like a fire, you can cook your dinner on it, or it can burn your house down.”

If we want travel and this beautiful earth to be around for our children and grandchildren, we must all become more aware and more responsible. Not just on Earth Day, but every day!

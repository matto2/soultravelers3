Thanks to tech, today almost any one can work or school any where [around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world travel") and we love the freedom that has afforded us as a [3 laptop family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/3-laptop-fami-2.html "3 laptop family") and truly enjoy our [exotic travel offices](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/10/the-traveling-o.html "exotic travel offices around the world").Â  Sometimes it's great, like this cute cafe in France near a vineyard, but often slow or bad internet is the most challenging part of [world travel.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "world travel")  
  
Surprisingly, it happens at times in the places one would least expect it, like our challenge of [finding wifi in Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/free-wifi-travel-office-paris-digital-nomad-technomad-minimalist-workshift-mobile-work-on-the-road.html "finding wifi in Paris"), yet we had no problem deep in the [Sahara](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/12/sahara-dream.html "sahara dream travel with family"). We were amazed how bad it is in Australia, experienced much [laptop madness in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/laptop-madness.html "laptop madness in Europe--no internet") and have had problems in London. We've only been moderately happy and often frustrated with the internet connection in Asia,( have used 3 providers including the current broadband) but the last two weeks it's been horrible.  
  
I was actually going to put up a different post today ( and tried to get it up this weekend) but due to our wonky internet these days, I hope I can get this one up. This is one of the many reasons I prefer to be [unplugged as much as possible](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "unplugged as much as possible"). The good news? One gets really good at work-arounds and that increases creativity.  
  
The only thing I miss about [California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "California travel") besides family and friends, is the fast connection speed. I wouldn't trade world travel for fast internet, but it can be a bit maddening at times. Hopefully we will fix it soon, but expect short or less posts until we do.  
  
Hope your week rocks! Happy Monday! Have you ever suffered bad internet abroad?

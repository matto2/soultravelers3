June 2010

Did you know that there are tents  
that are bigger than motorhomes  
in Europe? We didn't either, but

Did you know that there are tents that are bigger than [motorhomes in Europe?](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html) We didn't either, but apparently they are very popular with Dutch campers and we have come to admire them as we have seen them all over [Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and they seem quite handy for families. We were discussing it on our [Soultravelers3 Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187?ref=search), so I said I would post more information about them here on our blog.  
  
I don't know if you can tell by my pictures, but they really are bigger than most [European motorhomes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html). They just pack them in their cars and go! We see more campers from the [Netherlands](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/windmills-insid.html) and [Germany](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/family-travel-photo-germany-romantic-road.html) than any other country and we see them every where including rural [Morocco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/morocco-reflect.html#more) and [Turkey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/turkey-tree-hou.html).

The Dutch seem to be most fond of these huge tents. We asked a family that camped next to us about them last year and I think they said they just paid something like one hundred and fifty euros for it. I thought it was brand new, but it was used and they had bought it off a [Craig's list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigslist) kind of place.

When I was a kid we went camping in big tents, but these are super sized. They had electricity and set up little kitchens and have an awning for the "porch". I like the idea of using cots for beds too. Looks like a fun option for those interested in doing slow travel from a few bases. The car and mass transit make it very easy to do lots of day trips in compact Europe as well as relaxing days at the base.

Her own private play space next to our RV when we do longer stays.)

What do you think? Have you ever seen super huge tents?

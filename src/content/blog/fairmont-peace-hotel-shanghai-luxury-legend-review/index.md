The Fairmont Peace Hotel in Shanghai is a legendary luxurious art deco masterpiece that took our breath away! It's an absolutely exquisite hotel located at the best and most famous address in this ultra glamorous city, on the Huangou River at the corner of the Bund and Nanjing Lu. Shanghai was once known as Paris of the East and today it is one of the richest and most vibrant cities in the world.

The jaw-dropping dazzling view of the renowned Bund and extraordinary Pudong across the river, wowed even super [seasoned world travelers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "world traveling family") like us. Many say that [Shanghai has the world's best skyline](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/shanghai-skyline-worlds-best-.html "shanghai world's best skyline") and the peerless Peace Hotel and its elegant Cathay Room Restaurant and Terrace is the finest place to see and experience this futuristic  architectural eye-candy with massive use of neon, even on the boats floating by. Some say this beloved landmark is the closest one will ever get to dining at the imperial Court.

The Fairmont Peace Hotel is old world luxury at it's best and the history of this hotel overshadows that of any others in the Far East. This was the most glamorous hotel in the 1930's where Noel Coward wrote his play "Private Lives", and guests like Charlie Chaplin and Bernard Shaw visited with flamboyant creator Sir Victor Sassoon. It feels almost like time travel as Fairmont has done a flawless restoration using the finest marble, gilt and bronze. We found it a masterful combination of opulence from the past with ultra modern amenities.

True to every Fairmont Hotel we have been to ( [San Francisco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/family-vacation-san-francisco-fairmont-review-family-friendly-best-luxury-hotel-with-kids.html "San francisco fairmont hotel review"), [Singapore](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/top-hotel-for-luxury-fairmont-singapore.html "Singapore fairmont"), and [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/fairmont-beijing-5-star-luxury-hotel.html "beijing fairmont hotel")), the service was impeccable. We want to give a special thanks to Cherry Yu who went out of her way to make sure we had a dazzling time and warm, enthusiastic hotel General Manager Christophe Le Chatton. One can really sense the Fairmont family feeling and aim to please in every aspect of customer service.

The 1,600 square meter Octogonal hall and glass rotunda near the lobby embraces you with a vast yellow glass roof that allows the sunshine to softly shine on the ivory Italian marble floor and the large silver-leaf coated sculptural relief artwork along the walls with images of the ancient Bund landscape.

I got immense pleasure just lying in bed soaking up the romantic atmosphere. I felt like we had some how magically escaped into the Great Gasby world of Old Shanghai amongst the art deco style furnishings with every modern convenience.

Look at that gorgeous claw-foot tub with bath side LCD screen, perfect for a bubble bath after touring around town! Not to mention the huge marble shower and plenty of room for all of us with tons of closet space.

We were blessed to visit on [Thanksgiving weekend](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/thanksgiving-in-china.html "Thanksgiving in China"), and we started the first night in the meticulously refurbished Peace Hall which was once the heart of those extravagant galas and Parisian fashion shows in the twenties and thirties.

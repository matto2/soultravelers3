When Mozart started playing the violin at 23 months, we never realized that we would be [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling the world") for many years as a family. Thus we never realized that she would be a [kid playing her violin around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/where-in-heaven.html "kid playing violin around the world"), but now it has become our Soultravelers3 signature and fun habit.  
  
For kicks and a souvenir for her, we made our first Youtube video of her playing at various iconic spots around the world and were totally stunned when it became a [viral travel video](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4j0vh_where-in-heaven-is-mozart_travel "viral travel video") called [Where in Heaven is Mozart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4 "where in heaven is mozart travel video"). It has had almost 2 million views and continues to get daily views and comments.

We think it is hilarious that some people think that we just stayed home and put the photos of the locations on a green screen, but we actually visited each and every place of course. Now that we have been to 43 countries on 5 continents, we have two more similar videos coming, but haven't had time to get them up yet. This is a travel video not a music video and we made a delightful one of her [playing music around Paris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyqgnJcN5iY "playing music around Paris"), [playing a violin on a camel at Petra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vobwwib8dic "playing violin in Petra on a camel") and [serenading Tiger's Nest in Bhutan by violin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3cNJ53dUqA "tiger's nest bhutan violin ") too despite it being quite tricky to do these on the move in crowded, iconic places.

We actually never knew that she would be playing the violin at all. It happened because she had a [passion for music](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html "passion for music") from babyhood and grew up in a country neighborhood near an extraordinary Suzuki violin teacher ( and mother of 7). All the kids in the neighborhood played violin, so she had great interest in learning and an amazing teacher to meet that need.

Voila! Violin became part of our life and piano followed quickly starting at 3. We didn't want to leave them behind when we began to [travel the world as a family,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "travel the world as a family") so found a way because if there is a will there is always a way. The photo at the top is her playing in Edinburgh, Scotland ..one of our many stops and the little one is in the midst of a violin concert at three listening intently to her teacher.  
  
She  takes [lessons via webcams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ar90wOnWnM "piano lessons via webcams") with both violin and piano teachers on different continents. Our purpose with instruments is not to raise a great musician necessarily,  no more than [learning languages i](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "learning languages")s to raise a great linguist. We just feel they are part of a well rounded education and foundation.  
  
Music, violin and piano plus the people we have met through them, have added so much to our [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world trip"). Who knew music and travel was such a great match?

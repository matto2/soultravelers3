Why [travel with children](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/the-benefits-of-educational-travel-for-kids.html "travel with kids - educational benefits")? Is [traveling with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/ireland-travel-with-kids.html "traveling with kids in Ireland") [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/around-the-world-family-travel/ "around the world tips") an [educational benefit](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html "travel with kids educational benefit") and [doable dream?](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/advice-to-college-grads-from-a-world-traveler.html "advice to college grads about dreams from a world traveler") Our [trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raising-a-bilingual-child-or-trilingual.html "raising a bilinugual or trilingual child") 12 year old was recently interviewed for a [TV show](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/how-to-get-on-tv.html "how to get on TV") and we have been [traveling around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "traveling around the world ") non-stop for 8 years now, so I thought you might be interested in what she has to say.  
  
We are celebrating our 8 year travel anniversary as we [sold our home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "home and houses") in the fall of  2005 (and most of our belongings) to take this risk of a [permanent vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/secrets-for-a-permanent-vacation-travel-tips.html "permanent vacation secrets"), [world schooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "Worldschooling and travel"), [RTW family trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "reasons for a family world trip RTW"), so we made this video from a clip we sent them.

**DO YOU TRAVEL WITH YOUR KIDS?**  
  
[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/travel-distasters-vacation-nightmares.html "travel disasters and vacation nightmares") isn't always easy, but it is so enriching it has become my favorite type of travel. I am convinced there is [no better education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/learning-while-traveling-travel-homeschool-road-school-abroad-5-best-reasons.html "travel best education") and the [sweetest route](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/michelangelo-in.html "Michelangelo and peace process") to [a more peaceful world.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/world-peace-love-and-happiness.html "peaceful world, love and happiness")  
  
**CAN WE TEACH PEACE AND ACCEPTANCE THROUGH TRAVEL?**  
  
[![travel with your children = exploring Europe together](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff29a4e7970c.jpg "travel with your children = exploring Europe together")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff29a4e7970c.jpg)  
  
  
  
**HOW TO TRAVEL WITH A KID FOR 8 YEARS**  
  
First we prepared a LOT, [got rid of stuff](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "over consumerism and getting rid of stuff"),  and traveled via [USA roadtrips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "road trip USA") ( plan to do more of this for our [homeschool high school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool high school") and middle school), then [took off to Europ](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/the-long-flight.html "long flight to Europe with kid")e in September 2006 to [learn Spanish reading and writing in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "learn spanish in spain"), [explore Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best european vacations"), see [amazing ancient ruins](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/best-places-to-visit-ancient-roman-and-greek-ruins.html "best ancient roman and greek ruins") and more.  
  

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L1AspeNfcGE?rel=0" frameborder="0" height="480" width="640"></iframe>

  
  
We've explored 45 countries on 5 continents now on just $23/day per person, so Mozart has seen much more of the world than most ever do. We've also spent extended time in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/asia/ "Asia travel") and [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/china/ "China travel tips") to master [Mandarin fluentl](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "how to get fluent in Mandarin")y ( almost complete) and time in the Middle East, South Pacific islands, Oceana and more.  
  
Soon we will go back to beloved [Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/france-with-kids-exploring-provence.html "Provence travel") and [Tahiti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/the-ultimate-tahiti-vacation-on-a-backpacker-low-budget.html "tahiti travel cheaply") for French immersion ( via Mongolia and the Transiberian Railway)  in the near future and another trip to Oz later this month. Despite [traveling when sick](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "traveling when sick"), on our [healing journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/healing-journey-and-blessings.html "healing journey blessings") (or maybe because of it), we've become experts on [organic food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic food and travel"), [healthy eating](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "healthy eating and travel") and [homeschooling on the road](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school - best education - unschool and travel") through travel.

Best yet, Mozart has had [time to deeply bond with her Mom](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/mother-daughter-bonding-tips-for-tweens.html "mother daughter bonding - tips for tweens"), develop an [amazing father- daughter relationship](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/-father-daughter-relationships.html "father -daughter relationships"), grown up [fluently trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "how to raise a multilingual child") and [triliterate](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "triliterate ") in Mandarin, Spanish and English,

[![travel with kids - it is all about the loving](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff29416c970b.jpg "travel with kids - it is all about the loving")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff29416c970b.jpg)  
  
  
extended [travel with  her  Grandma in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "travel with Grandma - multigeneratioinal travel"), time with [cousins in Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "florida road trip") ( along with [Harry Potter's Wizarding World](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-kids-review.html "Harry Potters Wizarding world")) and many relatives in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "California").

**SLOW TRAVEL AND KEEPING UP RELATIONSHIPS**  
  
The key for our [trip around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "trip around the world") has been [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") and keeping up relationships as we roam the world.  Not only does it [prevent travel burn out](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/how-to-prevent-travel-burnout.html "prevent travel burn out"), but also allows our [location independent kid to have close friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "location independent travel kids and friends") and [deep relationships while traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "kids friends and travel").  
  
[![Travel with kids - means making cookies with aunties](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff2b7b36970d.jpg "Travel with kids - means making cookies with aunties")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff2b7b36970d.jpg)  
  
  
**HOW TO STAY CONNECTED WHILE TRAVELING**  
  
[Regular webcam calls](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-stay-connected-with-family-while-you-travel-around-the-world.html "how to stay in touch with famiyl while traveling"), returning to places we love regularly, visiting famiy or traveling with extended family  and [packages from home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/-living-and-traveling-abroad-mail-from-home-thrills.html "packages and mail from home for expats and travelers") are keys for us. In my opinion, with an only child, if you miss deep relationships, you miss the world. Sooo many amazing places on this planet, but it's the people that makes beautiful places extra special and memorable.  
  
[![Travel with kids means speaking in other languages like Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff2b2084970c.jpg "Travel with kids means speaking in other languages like Mandarin")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff2b2084970c.jpg)  
  
[Learning languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/language-learning/ "language learning") well has also helped her connect deeply and that takes time. Mozart is a very social child and loves things like birthday parties with friends and sleep overs. So we do sleep overs...in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/suite-bon-voyag.html "sleep over party california"), in [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/slumber-party-i.html "slumber party in spain"), in Denver,  [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/global-travel-tween-ultimate-birthday-party-in-asia.html "sleep over birthday party Asia") and more. ( Going to have another one this weekend.) She has [celebrated her birthday all over the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "celebrate birthdays around the world")...soon to celebrate another one.... in her 9th country and 4th continent.  
  
[![Travel with kids means making friends in your other languages...like Spanish](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff2b7dfc970d.jpg "Travel with kids means making friends in your other languages...like Spanish")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019aff2b7dfc970d.jpg)  
  
**FRIENDS AROUND THE WORLD**  
  
I am happy that Mozart has made [best friends around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "best friends around the world") in so many places and languages. So cute that this 12 year old feels like her heart is in every nook and cranny around the planet. Yes, [best friends and travel with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/best-friends-forever-and-travel-.html "best friends and travel with kids") can be compatible goals...even for a kid who has spent all her primary years...five through almost 13...exploring the world slowly!  
  
What do you see as the benefits of traveling with your children?

We found that learning about wooden shoes  
was perhaps the most interesting part of  
a very interesting and entertaining day.

We found that learning about wooden shoes was perhaps the most interesting part of a very interesting and entertaining day. The number of varieties alone was fascinating, then when one hears about all their attributes it makes you want to buy a pair. They are made out of Popular wood (fresh cut) and are strong enough to protect you from the weight of a car, they keep you warm in the winter, cool in the summer, are waterproof and make you walk tall and erect.  
  
We saw two ways of making them, the ancient way they have been doing for about 800 years and by an antique machine that is 75 years old that can make a pair in five minutes. You buy them quite a bit bigger than you would a normal pair of shoes. We already splurged on a pair for Mozart in red that she picked right off and loved to wear in the morning in the wet grass in Edam or clonking along loudly where ever she could, so it was really nice to know more about the history. Some people still wear them in Holland today and the man who worked the machine says he wears them daily and even drives his car with them.

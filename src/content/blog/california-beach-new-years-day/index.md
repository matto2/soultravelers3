It was hard to beat  
the gorgeous California  
weather on New Year's Day,

It was hard to beat the gorgeous California weather on New Year's Day, so we took a family walk down to the beautiful and charming Capitola beach. Sadly, we are all sick ( even my Mom with bronchitis and sister who was hospitalized over Xmas for pnuemonia)  with coughs ( on top of my stomach issues), but despite me having a miserable sleepless night and in quite severe pain as I woke, we were determined to keep to our New Year's goals of more fun, greater health, more Spiritual focus.

We are really lucky that our church does many wonderful things online, ( their Living in Grace retreat online was a highlight for me and one of the most amazing, profound retreats on the planet... that they have done every Christmas season for over 20 years and we've done a few in person). So we were able to have a Spirit filled morning with old friends from around the world that helped immensely with my condition and gave us all ways to journal, talk about our intentions for 2012 and even do a labyrinth walk with our fingers from our bed! I feel so blessed to have this resource in my life that also supports our Spiritual connection during our  travel lifestyle.

We couldn't resist the fun rainbow colored hair extentions at a beach store on our walk, to keep to our "more fun" theme and include kiddo in the enthusiasm. It matched quite nicely with one of  her fave Christmas presents, a T-shirt that says "Girls can change the world".

I have lots of happy memories of Capitola beach from over 40 years of visiting this oldest beach in California and we even lived right on the beach here for a short while  one winter ( before kidlet was born) when we rented out the beach apartment my Mom owned when we were between houses.

We mostly just laid around and coughed all day, but it was good to get out and get some fresh air and beautiful views.

Reminders of the romantic place we are in...

and the joy of the California beach lifestyle.

We lazed about on benches by the beach with these colorful hand made tiles from local school kids as we watched the sun slowly set.

Kidlet made friends with some adorable dogs on the beach....

And we were reminded once again about just how blessed we are! We are sad that we missed our Jan 3 flight to tropical Asia, but pleased we were able to move my MRI up to Jan 3rd, so hopefully we will know more soon and be on our way.  
  
Thankfully the MRI showed normal ( but sadly the [contrast dye they put in the IV](http://www.youhavealawyer.com/gadolinium/side-effects/ "contrast dye mri problems") gave me absolutely excruciating pain for 3 days and 2 sleepless nights..mostly in the kidney area where I had not had pain before). Of course no one warned me about the pain, so I was unaware of the possible complications until I had already done it. I've been using a full raw diet to help flush it out and it seems to be helping some as I got my first decent nights sleep last night and hope that continues.  
  
Now I must make decisions on more tests and am about to try some more natural supplements. After trying tons of different diets, I am now exploring [Aajonus Vonderplanitz's unusual raw food ideas](http://www.wewant2live.com/ "aajonas Vonderplanitz strange raw food ideas") ( introduced to me by [Dr. McCombs](http://drmccombs.wordpress.com/ "Dr. McCombs")) and they seem to be helping ( too early to tell for sure)  and Jeff McCombs continues to be a great support and has suggested new supplements that I am looking forward to trying.  
  
What about you? What are your intentions or goals for 2012? Do you journal about what you want more of in your life and what you are grateful for?

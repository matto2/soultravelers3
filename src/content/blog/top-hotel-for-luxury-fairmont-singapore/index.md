If you are looking for the top hotel for luxury in Singapore with a spectacular location in the center of it all, and amazing world class service, you can't beat the [Fairmont Singapore](http://www.fairmont.com/singapore "fairmont singapore"). You might remember from our stay and [review of the San Francisco Fairmont](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/family-vacation-san-francisco-fairmont-review-family-friendly-best-luxury-hotel-with-kids.html "review of San Francisco Fairmont"), that we are huge fans of [Fairmont Hotels](http://www.fairmont.com/ "fairmont hotels") who are leaders in luxury hospitality and one of the world's top eco-brands.  
  
Conde Nast Readers Travel Awards 2010 ranked The Fairmont Singapore as one of the top 20 Overseas Business Hotels in the world, but we also found it fantastic for a family friendly get away in Singapore. As business owners, boomers and a family with a young child, we see the advantages to all.

From the moment that you enter the sophisticated Fairmont Singapore, greeted by the warm smiles of the doorman in his traditional outfit and the welcoming staff in the peaceful, zen flavored lobby, you know you are in for a treat. It is strategically located in the heart of the city's business, historical, cultural and shopping districts so you can easily walk to many things which we enjoyed.  
  
It's just 20 minutes from the Singapore Airport, near bus services and it's also directly above a  major MRT subway hub and part of the famous and gigantic Raffles City complex which includes many elegant restaurants ( with everything from Italian to Japanese food) and chic shops. Thus it's very easy to get whatever you need, be it close to meetings in the central business district or accessible to the various places in Singapore that you'd want to visit on a romantic weekend or exporations with kids. Fairmont Singapore offers 769 luxurious guestrooms and suites, 16 distinctive restaurants and bars and 70,000 square feet of prime meeting space with an award-winning service team that go above and beyond.

After a long flight from Sydney, and with Singapore as our first stop in Asia,  we were ready for some TLC and glamour and nobody does it better than the Fairmont Singapore with their magic of making one feel totally  at home while being pampered in luxury. Our ten year old was thrilled to check out the room and loved the experience from the get go...as did her parents.  
  
We stayed in an Executive Club Deluxe room  which was exquisite and we slept in their ultra comfortable king size heavenly bed that many call the best sleep in Asia. The very large all white luxurious bathrooom with rainforest shower heads was divine. They also had ample workspace, a BOSE entertainment system and broadband internet which was very handy for us as we work on our travel blog as we roam. We had a lovely balcony with pool and awesome cityscape views.

They also have a dedicated executive floor with its own beautiful lounge, in-room expresso machines, office space with computers and printers, complementary use of meeting rooms, huge selection of teas, scrumptious snacks,  even a private gym and more. Not to mention their Willow Stream Spa which is the largest in Singapore with a huge variety of Aisan and European massages and body treatments.

Due to jet lag, and after a swim and bubble bath, kidlet conked out in the middle of the day wrapped in her Fairmont robe and some how that photo captures the essence of the Fairmont Singapore "ahhh" experience to me.

We all really loved the delicious healthy buffet breakfast at the pool with it's spectacular setting and enomous selection of international breakfast and brunch choices. As you can see more clearly by the aerial view from our room, shown in the photo at the bottom of this page, there are both an adult pool and a kids pool which makes it very family friendly. It made me smile to meet other parents swimming with their kids in this beautiful setting while still honoring the peacefulness for retirees and business folks at the other end, thanks to the large area.

The Fairmont experience is very much about the people who run it and the impeccable service that they give. Something that is rare in today's world and one reason why we are very proud to have Fairmont Hotels as a sponsor. We were happy to do a tour of the Fairmont Singapore and learn more from some very charming and enthusiastic staff members.  
  
They spoiled us with three elegant, colorful sashes that reflected the rich cultural tapestry of Singapore's Chinese, Malay and Indian heritage woven in silk, batic and sari fabrics. They were made for the Youth Olympic Games, so we were very touched to have this special souvenir of our stay. They are the kind of people who delight in generous surprises, so Mozart also got a lovable stuffed toy and DaVinci got a marvelous Fairmont Singapore cap that they use for the Grand Prix.

 The entire hotel is resplendant, but what I think impressed me the most is the levels that they go to for personal service. As you can see in the photo above, they actually give  tennis shoes and track suit to a guest who is a runner, but doesn't want to pack his carry on case with these bulky extras.  Wow!

After the tour, we had lunch together at their impressive Chinese restuarant, the Sechaun Court ( with humongous antique doors imported from China)  and had the most delectable meal. It truly was the BEST Chinese food we ever had! What a splended welcome to Asia and it was wonderful to make new friends.  
  
I want to give a special thanks to Elissa Ong, Walter Navaroo, Angeline Tan, and Shaik Shidek who made our stay extra special as well as Mike Taylor and Natalie Kosikowsky who introduced us. We are so inspired by the good and intriguing people that we have met through Fairmont Hotels (both here and in San Francisco), that we think it must say a lot about the company culture.

 Did I mention the hand made candies that we found in our room? OMG yummy and just another one of the special perks that come with a deluxe stay at the Fairmont Singapore. If you are looking for legendary world class pampering in Singapore, you know where to head. Have you been yet?

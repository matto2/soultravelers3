Most of the important developments in western art, science, literature and architecture took root and flourished in Florence during the renaissance, when it was the center of European culture. It is a dream destination for art-lovers as the city boasts Europe’s richest concentration of artistic wealth. We couldn’t help but be a bit haunted by the great PBS show on the Medici’s rein that we had watched the night before as we took in the Michelangelo’s and Donatello’s. I had never known that two Medici brothers became popes and the amount of corruption and violence that ruled the day.

Florence was a bit over cast and cold our first few days and we even got caught in some rain, but we are still glad that we came late in the season as we ran into no crowds except at the Uffizi. The sun did come out and we had some beautiful days there as well. There was a killer heat wave when we were nearby in Chianti in June, thus we decided to catch Florence in the cool fall after most of the tourists have gone home. Good choice.

It is a wonderful city to walk in, so that is what we did, just soaking up the atmosphere and beauty everywhere.

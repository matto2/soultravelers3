Do you love to shop? Because we are [always traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "always traveling"), we get to see a LOT of [souvenir shops](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-scotland-edinburgh-funny-sign-souvenir-shop-edinburgh-festival-camping.html "souvenir shops"). Some times I wonder who buys these kinds of things, yet they must sell well because we see similar things every where. After retiring, my Mom use to have a souvenir and shell shop near the beach and I was always amazed at how much stuff they could fit in there and how well it sold.  
  
We are [minimalist long term travelers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist long term travelers"), so we mostly just look at souvenir shops like in [Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/nazare.html "portugal"), [Carcassonne in France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/carcassonne-med.html "carcassonne in France"), or a [pottery place in Morocco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/moroccan-potter.html "pottery place in Morocco").  
We tend to like to buy hand made things like we did in [sand art in Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/sand-art-in-jordan.html "Jordan"), [Byzantine art in Crete](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/06/byzantine-art.html "Byzantine art in Crete"), [Lace in Galica](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/lace-pottery-in.html "Lace in Galicia") or woven fabric in Bhutan and give the money directly to the artist.  
  
Collections are fun for traveling kids. Mozart has enjoyed collecting little travel buttons. They are perfect for us because they are tiny and the price is right. Sometimes we splurge and buy her a traditional outfit..usually too cute for me to resist and gives her a feel for the place.  
  
Do you buy souvenirs when you travel? What do you like to buy?

Road schooling, World schooling, homeschooling, unschooling...no matter what you call it, I think our family has more experience at it than most on the planet since we've been traveling the world non-stop since our child was five and now she is eleven.  
  
I am still astounded by how rich her education has been on just $23/day as we've traveled to 43 countries on 5 continents. Lucky kid! We'd never be able to give her all this without our travel lifestyle. It's also been key on allowing us as monolingual parents to raise a fluent trilingual/triliterate who knows bits of many languages.

Our daughter has had some absolutely amazing learning opportunites from [swimming with sharks in Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "swimming with sharks in Bora Bora") to [sailing the Turquoise Coast of Turkey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/sailing-away.html "sailing the Touquoise coast in Turkey") to [exploring ruins like Pompeii](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/pompeiiburied-a.html "exploring ruins like Pompeii") and [Petra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "Petra travel") to [climbing the Tiger's Nest in Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html "climbing the Tiger's Nest in Bhutan") and [sleeping in the Sahara](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html "sleeping in the Sahara")!

Our main purpose in our world travel is to educate our child, so we've written quite a bit about education on the road in hopes that it will also help and inspire you:

We've got LOTS more to share on this topic and these last few months we've been road schooling in [California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/california-beach-new-years-day.html "california travel"), so have tried some new things in our old home territory and we were especially pleased with the science opportunities that I will write about.  
  
One thing Mozart loved was Karate and she proudly earned a yellow belt during our short stay! She could have taken karate when we [wintered in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html "wintering in spain"), but she wasn't in the mood then, yet loved it this time around.  
  
Any questions about education and travel?

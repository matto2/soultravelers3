Who would have guessed that Soultravelers3 would be featured on Fox News? It was never part of our plan any more than our [Soultravelers3 feature interview on BBC TV about travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "soultravelers3 on BBC TV about travel and social media") and social media or our [digital nomad interview in the New York Times](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html "digital nomad interview new york times"). I am still [amazed how these things come to us](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/02/twitter-travel-20.html "amazed how these things come to us via social media") out of the blue. What a fabulous surprise for our [Florida road trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "Florida road trip")!

All three of these interview requests came to us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 Twitter") ( private direct mail). I've known [@SavvyBabii](http://twitter.com/#!/SavvyBabii "savvyBabii") on Twitter for a while and her daughter [@MegaMediaGrl](https://twitter.com/#!/MegaMediaGrl "megamediagrl") is a producer at Fox News, so voila! That's part of the magic of social media and the back channels of things like Twitter and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187 "facebook soultravelers3") that bring opportunities and great win-win connections, besides just being fun!**

**They were as sweet in person as they are online and we really enjoyed the anchors and all the folks we met there.What a fabulous ["world school" educational](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world school education") moment for Mozart as well, since she got to see the insides of a TV news studio and do live TV.

![huge TV station satellites](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330162fc36188a970d.jpg)  
  
  
From seeing the huge satellites outside, to the director's room, to being miked, visiting the makeup room, to seeing how it all works in detail in person, this is all pretty exciting stuff for a kid. Heck, for each of us.  
  
  It's true, she was on local TV in California for violin when she was little before we left to [tour the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "Tour the world"), she has been [filmed for Japanese TV](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/mozarts-film-de.html "filmed for Japanese TV") in Croatia, as well as a different [BBC TV feature](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/bbc-world-news-featured-soultravelers3-youtube-viral-travel-video-fast-track-bbcnews.html "soultravelers3 BBC TV") and has gained [Youtube stardom](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3?ob=5 "Youtube stardom") with viral videos,  but this was her first "live" TV interview. Funny, but we were recently [in Jordan and being able to perform on TV as an news anchor](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/amazing-family-fun-at-four-seasons-amman.html " Jordan Children's museum") was her favorite part of the Children's Museum there, so this was an extension to all of these "world school" opportunities.  
  
For one very ordinary family that has never sent out one press release, nor ever expected this attention, it's been a very extraordinary journey in so many ways. Without realizing it, Mozart couldn't have said a better answer than [Harry Potter's Wizarding World](http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/ "Harry Potter's wizarding world") in Orlando, but we had just spent the day before there and she is a fanatic HP fan who has been counting down this visit for a year. Perfect icing on the 11th birthday cake!  
  
Have you ever been on "live" TV?

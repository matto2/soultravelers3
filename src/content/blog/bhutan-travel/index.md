Bhutan travel is like no where  
else in the world and you know  
it as soon as the plane lands.

Actually it is quite a thrilling plane ride in amongst the [Himalayan mountains](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/stunning-himalaya-travel-bhutan.html#more "Bhutan travel himalaya mountains") and some say the most difficult landing in the world. [Bhutan is breathtakingly beautiful](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/bhutans-colorful-art.html#more "Bhutan beatiful art"),  pristine, and is called  the last Shangri La on earth and we think it should be on everyone's bucket list.

Even for [world travelers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "world travelers") like us, arriving in Bhutan is like arriving into a whole new fantasy world in this ancient kingdom and [happiest place on earth](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/bhutan-happiest-place-on-earth--1.html#more "bhutan happiest place on earth"). Just look at this gorgeous, hand painted, tiny airport sitting in the middle of the Himalayan mountains.

We were blessed to be the first travel bloggers to be hosted by the amazing [Tourism Council of Bhutan](http://www.tourism.gov.bt/ "Tourism Council of Bhutan") and it was a joy to meet Jamyang Choden when we arrived after our email conversations. They all took wonderful care of us from the moment we arrived as they shared their beautiful country with us.  
  
You can see our guides packing up our SUV and everyone dressed in traditional clothes as Bhutan bridges the gap between the modern world and the ancient world like no where else.

Vagabonding  
This is an inspiring book about extended travel with lots of good information. Not specifically for families, but they are mentioned and the information applies to all. This is a must-read if you are planning extended travel and I remember how it got me psyched during our planning stages. He shows how little money it takes to travel really.

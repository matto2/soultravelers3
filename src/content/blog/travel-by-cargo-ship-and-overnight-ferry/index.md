Who knew that travel by  
freighter, cargo ship or ferry  
can be one of the best ways to travel?

Who knew that travel by freighter, cargo ship or ferry can be one of the best ways to travel? We've done a lot of it on our [family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family world tour") in the last 7 years, but we probably never would have thought about it as a travel option before doing extensive [road trips in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-europe-plan-then-improvise.html "road trips Europe").  
  
**CHEAPER AND FASTER**  
  
Sometimes it is MUCH cheaper, faster and convenient to hop on a freighter ship with one's motorhome in Europe, like we did from England to Sweden, rather than drive.  It was a new and luxurious ship and we really enjoyed this relaxed mode of travel that reminds one of the old seafaring ways, with privacy and  only a handful of other passengers. I didn't write about that cargo ship ride yet, but below there are similar stories in other destinations in Europe, Africa and Turkey.  
  
**TAKE YOUR CAR OR CAMP ONBOARD**  
  
You can take your car on most of these, sometimes one can even camp inside one's motorhome while on the ship and save money on a cabin fee. We often rent a cabin for the privacy, but it is much cheaper to sleep in the comfortable lounges. Often times we run into biking travelers and people from all walks of life and many countries...although other Americans are rare.  
  
**TIPS FOR FREIGHTERS AND FERRIES**  
  
It was a bit of a intimidating adventure the first time, but now that we've done it so much, we don't hesitate to do it often and it is one of our child's favorite ways to travel. Here are some posts that I have written on this topic.

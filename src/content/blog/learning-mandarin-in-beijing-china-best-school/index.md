What is the [best way to learn Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "best way to learn Mandarin in Asia") or any language? [Immersing in a Chinese school in Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "immersing in a chinese school in Beijing for Mandarin  language learning ") was a fantastic experience for us and our daughter made great strides by being in an all Mandarin environment 24/7 while we were [in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "travel to China").  
  
[Learning Mandarin in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "learning mandarin in Penang, Malaysia") at a [Chinese school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "Chinese school") has been a very wise choice for us and allowed her to [visit China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "visit china") for the first time already [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "fluent in Mandarin - an american in Asia"). Our [world school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school") method and [ultimate family adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate family adventure") these last 7 years, combines [homeschooling with travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling and travel") and dipping into [local schools for languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "local schools for language immersion - spain"). Each school and country enriches us and adding China taught us all new things.  
  
This is a photo of us with Ms. Huang (next to me) the wonderful principal at [Guangren](http://www.chinatravel20.com/t/guangren/ "View all posts in Guangren") kindergarten (广仁书院)  and other teachers and parents with the kids that come every day to the after school program. The teacher on the other end has a PhD in teaching and tested Mozart on her Mandarin and found her to be doing well at a 3rd grade level reading and writing which she increased while there.

We have great gratitude to Winser from [China Travel 2.0](http://www.chinatravel20.com/ "china travel 2.0") who introduced us and set this up for us as well as our [homestay in Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/best-homestay-living-with-a-family-in-china.html "homestay in Beijing"). These were amazing heart-focused, generous people, a gorgeous waldorf inspired school, serving scrumptious organic food and a very special community. We miss them already and were deeply touched by the [kindness in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/random-acts-of-kindness-in-travel.html "random acts of kindness and travel") and [ancient wisdom and traditions](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/confusius-temple-in-beijing-and-tcm-tourism.html "Chinese traditions").  
  
I have much more to share about our time at this [enchanting school.](http://blog.sina.com.cn/3hgrsy "Guangren school in Beijing")  I didn't put the school name or links in while in China for safety reasons, but can do that now. ( We don't usually say our location online until we are gone to protect our child).  
  
Have you ever learned a language through immersion?

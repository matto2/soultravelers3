We have a new 3 bedroom 5 bed bungalow at this price & the over priced place in California was a tiny one bedroom without room for even a kitchen table!

This is a pristine, convenient, luxurious, safe location for singles, families and couples. There are three wonderful, huge pools here including a very luxurious indoor one, plus jacuzzi, sauna, kids shows, disco, great Catalan restaurant, bar, zoo, laundry service, take out food, basketball & sports courts, workout room, massages, arcade, tours, wifi in bungalows & motorhomes and more. We are a 15 second walk away from the biggest outdoor pool, waterslide, indoor pool & gym, yet have the whole resort almost to ourselves in this off season mid May with perfect weather, birds chirping & utter tranquility.

There is a store & great restaurant onsite, but one can also ride the bus to the nearby small town for fresh food markets and stores ( 15 minute ride) which helps one connect to locals as well as the people from many countries at the resort that you can meet. We met our [best friends](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html) here in 2006/7 and no time seems to pass when we connect again & he always makes superb Paella for us like he did this week! The bakery and market on site at this resort are very good with abundant choices, even when the resort is at full capacity, but prices are a bit cheaper in town. The bakery onsite has the best croissants in Europe & the restaurant has take away food like yummy rotisserie whole chickens. Spaniards & Europeans love good food, so there are plenty of great choices.

There are 5 beautiful beaches nearby boasting a 3.5km stretch that are typical of the Spanish Mediterranean coastline with wide expanses of fine, golden sand, they are cleaned daily & at some there are restaurants nearby. The marina between two of the  beaches has been named as one of the top 10 most beautiful ports in Europe & specializes in super yachts & boating trips are available.

Some people winter here, although Barcelona and Madrid get too cold for my taste, so I prefer the warmest place in Europe for winter, Andalucia on the southern coast. We have stayed at similar RV & bungalow resorts in Marbella and Portugal's Algarve where the winters are the warmest. We see many smart Europeans from all over taking advantage of these bargains, but never see Americans. Prices and crowds go up in high season July and August ( like all of Europe as that is when all Europeans take their summer vacations) & it can get  busier on weekends as the locals love to do weekends here which adds a buzz of people, and the very best prices are for 55 and up as they mostly do the long stays, but most of the time it is sublime and quiet off high season. There is a wide variety of bungalows and "glamping" options available, but we do the one that is on special offer for long stays and people over 55. Heavenly and I also stayed once in a glamping option that was the cheapest and it was also nice, but not as nice as this. The long stay van/camper option is the cheapest and they have great showers, bathrooms, dishwashing areas for that.   
  
![Cheap  Furnished Rentals in Barcelona Beach Resort! soultravelers3 kitchen](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330278807c7412200d.jpg)  
Our bungalow is new, roomy, comfortable size with every convenience including heat & air conditioning, refrigerator, cook top stove, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, plates, silverware, dishes, pots & pans, cupboards, good shower, bathroom, hair dryer and plenty of room to eat or work digitally inside or out with very much an indoor/outdoor feeling. We usually have the windows and doors open during the day to enjoy the nature views, fresh air and sounds of the birds and mostly enjoy eating outside on the large, covered porch which has table chairs and lounge chairs to rest or sun in outside. We have the lawn chairs out on our "lawn" area and there is also a place & apparatus to dry hand washed clothes or beach towels, bathing suits etc. and cleaning supplies ( mop etc).   
  
![Cheap  Furnished Rentals in Barcelona Beach Resort soultravelers3 bedroom](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330282e154fc6a200b.jpg)  
  
The beds are very comfortable and sheets and blankets are provided. We were surprised to get a 3 bedroom and 5 beds ( two bedroom with 2 twin sized beds) and the master bedroom was tighter than the last time Heavenly and I  rented one of these bungalows where there was only 2 bedrooms ( only one set of twin beds and one full size bed). The photo below is from their website and is closer to what we had last time. We were going to change to a 2 bedroom, but after we started unpacking our vintage camper, we realized that this was actually the best site for us and also has a big driveway so the people at the front desk booked what works best for us this time. The extra bedrooms give us extra space to deal with the work we are doing clearing out.   
  
![Cheap  Furnished Rentals in Barcelona Beach Resort! soultravelers3 larger master bedroom](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330278807c74a2200d.jpg)  
We are not using the 2 other bedrooms except for storage etc, but they both look like this and have a small closet to hang things, hooks and storage spaces ( like the master bedroom, but smaller).They come with bedding and blankets, but we have not used them. Again, the 2 bedroom one we stayed in before has more room in both bedrooms, but this works for us because we are moving stuff in and out of our camper and dealing with that this time and this one has a large yard and place to park the camper when we unload it. I am happy I found an organization that can use Heavenly's used kids clothes for families that are here from Ukraine.

One of the great things about this resort living is being in nature and living indoor/outdoor style and being in the beautiful, well taken care of and lush nature here. Outside living is part of the charm of daily life and being able to walk to everything and eat meals outside on the large covered porch. On the weekend there was a huge event for a big CrossFit competition, so we had neighbors, but that was mostly Friday night and Saturday as all were gone by Sunday around noon and now we have no close neighbors. I went to the pool this morning and there was just one other couple there in that huge space with sea views.

The living room area is comfortable and practical and we love the views of nature out all of the windows and we usually have them open all day long both curtains and windows for fresh air, even the door is open with a curtain which is the Spanish custom and adds to the indoor outdoor feel. Lots of trees so birds are the main sound along with the silence.

Unlike the photo below, our sink is actually white, but just looks pinkish in this photo, but I mainly took it to show the modern style and attached dryer. The toilet is in a separate room by itself which is handy if you have a group of people.

We love this location and resort, so have been coming here regularly since Heavenly was 5 or 6 years old  and plan to spend many more long stays here as we considerer this place, Barcelona and Costa Brava, one of our "homes" and we love the luxury and peace on such a low budget.

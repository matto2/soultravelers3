"Change is a dragon - ride it and transform." Now [we visit China](http://www.chinatravel20.com/2012/11/04/the-soultravelers3-coming-to-beijing/ "visit to China"), our 45th country on 5 continents of our [open ended world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "open ended world tour"). What shall we learn together?  
  
The Dragon is a major symbol of good fortune in Chinese Astrology, considered one of the luckiest animals and symbolizes strength, power, virtue, harmony and longevity. It is considered a great honor by the Chinese to be born in the year of the Dragon and is considered the most special sign and is sometimes called the karmic sign.  
  
If you ignore the dragon, it will eat you. If you try to confront the dragon it will overpower you. If you ride the dragon, you will take advantage of its might and power.  
~ A Chinese Proverb  
  
I really know very little about Chinese Astrology, but think it is interesting that Mozart and I are both Dragons, visiting China for the first time in a Dragon year. Just as it was interesting that my mother who is a Rabbit, came to Asia to [celebrate Chinese New Year](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "celebrating chinese new year") with us last year...which just happened to be the year of the Rabbit.  
  
And DaVinci is a Snake, so next year is the year of the Snake ( starting around February) and we will all be celebrating that one in Asia too.  
  
Hmmmm,coincidense? Funny where life leads us as these things were not planned. Do you know what your Chinese Astrology sign is?  
  
By the time you read this post, we should be i[n China](http://www.chinatravel20.com/c/tours/ "china tours"). We look forward to sharing our adventure into more Mandarin immersion and exploring China with you! What would you most like to know?

Where is the best meal in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/bye-bye-barcelo.html "family tour barcelona")? Is this the latest hot spot? I think it is at our friends house! So scrumptious that I am still dreaming about it and with the dearest of friends.  
  
 One of the best things about [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family traveling  around the world"), especially [long term famly travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "long term family travel"), is making friends with locals. Not only is it very rewarding just for the friendship and personal connection, but it can also  give you much more insight to what is really happening in an area and how real locals live, so connects one deeper to the country and area.  
  
We love this family that we happened to meet while [camping in Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "camping barcelona"). It is common for local Spaniards to come stay at this resort, especially on weekends. They happened to once camp with their caravan right across from us and we have children the same age. Voila! They were a little suprised that our little blondie (with Holland license plates on her motorhome)  was fluent in Spanish, but the rest is history and we have all been fast friends since.  
  
We both have a passion for travel and they are the sweetest and most generous people. Our daughters are [best friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "best friends through travel") now ( key to [long term travel with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "long term travel with kids")), we stay in touch regularly via webcam calls ( showed them our views in [Tahiti](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "tahiti cheap") , [Santa Cruz](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/homeaway-santa-cruz-beach-house-vacation-rental-review-best-family-friendly-lodging.html "santa cruz, cal") and [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html"))  and they even surprised on our [arrival to Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/barcelona-arrival-police-omg.html "barcelona arrival for travelers") this year.  
  
We knew he made the [best paella in Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "best paella in barcelona"), but they out did themselves with this meal as well. Like our [Spanish friends that lived in Malaga](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/marvelous-meal.html "spanish friends malaga"), they have a beautiful and spotless home. ( I never have a spotless home unless company is coming or I am selling it, so that always impresses me, but DaVinci's sister is also like this so perhaps it is a Spanish trait).

We had [tortilla de patatas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_omelette "spanish omelete /tortilla de patatas") for an appetiser which is one of my favorite Spanish dishes despite it's simplicity. Oh and the way he made the clam appetisers was so delicious. DaVinci made up a recipe for sushi for the road and we shared it with them last summer, so it was funny to see he was now an expert at making his own sushi. We had wonderful Spanish cheeses, and steak , more ...and cava of course.  
  
They only speak Spanish and my Spanish is very poor, but some how we make it work. [Mozart translates when we get stuck](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "child translates for parents"), but mostly we mangage, thanks to their patience and a little charades sometimes. I know a lot of words in Spanish, I am just not that good at putting them together. DaVinci is weak in Spanish too, but much better than me, so that helps.  
  
We have loved [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/more-gaudi-wond.html "barcelona and gaudi") for a long time, and have been here over 14 times on our world tour,  but having these very precious friends here makes it even more special for us.

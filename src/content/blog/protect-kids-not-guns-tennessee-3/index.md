 I knew nothing about Tennessee politics when this ["Tennessee Three"](https://eu.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/07/kamala-harris-nashville-updates-expelled-tennessee-lawmakers/70093118007/) news broke of an illegal,  unprecedented act of retaliation and overt racism and almost fell over when I saw this tweet video that went viral  because Justin Pearson looked and sounded like he was the reincarnation of Martin Luther King with the power of the sixties leaders and was/is amazingly articulate and so moving ,inspiring (especially for one only 28) and all done under such pressure and spontaneously. Just take a listen and one knows immediately that a [star](https://twitter.com/MarkHamill/status/1644459710500962304?s=20) and a [leader is born](https://twitter.com/peasoftheworld/status/1644484225263980546?s=20)!

 I think these three will continue to make history and change the world. Both Justin Jones and Justin Pearson are absolutely stunning leaders who are so needed now and have long, important careers ahead of them. Both have been activists since boyhood and have already accomplished much. One is the son of a preacher and the other is in Divinity graduate school. So they seem to have passion, Spirit, hard work, charisma and brilliance on their side. Gloria in her sixties was a teacher for many years, has wise mom energy and is a [survivor of a school shooting!](https://twitter.com/shannonrwatts/status/1644773144656494593?s=20)

They [met with the president](https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1644459213962326017?s=20) virtually and with the [Vice president who made one of the best speeches of her career with them](https://twitter.com/TheTNHoller/status/1644520372031684611?s=20), have been on Good Morning America, [Meet the press](https://twitter.com/MeetThePress/status/1645086156722249730?s=20), CNN, [Maddow](https://twitter.com/TheTNHoller/status/1645610706065080325?s=20) and many more places. It is a long road to justice, but this kind of inspiration and "good trouble" has excited so many of us around the world. It is so exciting to see the crowds gather and support them.

One of the things that also blew my mind and I think everyone should see is Justin did a sermon on Easter Sunday. I watched it from Cyprus and sobbed it was so moving and genius. Here is a small peek of it:   
  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wow. I’ve said it before & I’ll say it again. Justin Pearson is one of the best orators we have as Democrats. He’s so good & powerful & I know this is only the beginning for him. Take a moment and watch this.

Like so much of this, it was all an "accident" and part of what inspired me so much was this was a planned Easter event some time ago to combine a white church and a black church ( Justin's dad is a preacher). Then the expelling happened, so Justin was asked to speak and it could not have been more perfect as far as timing. It was truly beautiful also because the white church and the black church experience God, singing and church in VERY different ways, but set such an example for us all on how we are all connected to Grace even if we do it differently as individuals and cultures. For me it was the perfect Easter service and Pearson's sermon "Resurrection is a Promised Prophecy to a Persecuted People" was just what I needed to hear. You can hear the full service from youtube ( or go to his sermon at the [1:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ0Gk2MAvtQ&t=65s).00 mark).

Another mind blowing "accident" with these two Justin's (who seem to have dropped out of the sixties just as the world needed them so much), is Justin accidentally ran into Joan Baez at the airport who came up to him and thanked him for what he is doing. ( This was around the same time on Sunday that the other Justin was preaching). They sang ["we shall overcome" together!](https://boingboing.net/2023/04/10/we-shall-overcome-justin-jones-and-joan-baez-unite-in-song-at-airport.html)!

April 9, 2007

We just loved the people of Morocco and  
the children in the desert particularly  
touched us with their smiles and sweet faces.

We just loved the people of Morocco and the children in the desert particularly touched us with their smiles and sweet faces. We were very fortunate to have time with them at the concert, but we met some even before that when we arrived and walked thru the village to our guest house and on our early morning walk.

Fatima, smiling in the picture above at her home, was a shining light and she and Mozart had fun playing together although they did not share any languages. They both love Djou who is Alessandra and Hmad’s fourteen month old daughter who is an adorable ball of energy. I have forgotten the name of Hmad’s thirteen year old sister in the blue sweater, but she also had a precious disposition and looked just like him. The boy in the blue djellaba playing with Djou and Mozart is the one who was the helper at our lodge.  
Girls often marry at thirteen or fourteen.

There were lots of children that I do not know names for, but their sweet faces are now part of our consciousness forever.

Is it possible to take a [permanent vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing world tour")? YES! We've been on an [endless vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/endless-summer-joy-of-tropical-winter-travel.html "endless summer, endless vacation") for 8 years and loving it still. We sold our [California dream home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "california dream  home") in 2005 and decided to take the risk of [retiring early](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/retire-and-travel-the-world.html "retire and travel the world") to [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family world trip") and [educate](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "education and travel") our ( now [fluently trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html "growing up bilingual or trilingual")) child with [world schooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school or unschool").

For us, it's been the best decision we ever made and I do think it is a doable goal for almost anyone who wants to do this. [Perpetual travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "perpetual travel or PT") is actually easier and cheaper than most people realize..even for [RTW families](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/around-the-world-with-kids-extended-travel-long-term-travel-families-and-friends.html "around the world with kids")...but like most things in life, it takes planning, sacrifice, and calculated risks.  
  
We [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "travel the world RTW as a family") for less than we could live at home..on just $23/day and have seen 45 countries on 5 continents so far. We think we're giving our child the [best possible education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "best possible education...homeschool and travel") and love our time together.

“Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work and driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for - in order to get to the job you need to pay for the clothes and the car, and the house you leave vacant all day so you can afford to live in it.” Goodman

**WANT TO LEAVE THE RAT RACE?**  
  
Recently a long time reader commented that "I've also wanted so much to be able to do what you're doing with my little family of three. I've tried figuring out how we could earn the funds to do this but can't seem to find a viable way."

**SECRETS FOR CREATING YOUR OWN PERMANENT FAMILY VACATION LIFESTYLE**  
  
Don't get disheartened ...I know planning a [long term trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html "BEST TIPS FAMILY FRIENDLY TRAVEL") can seem daunting and totally overwhelming...but there are now a TON of people doing it...even many families...so YOU can too. If there is a will there is always a way!  

  
[![Endless vacation means enjoying the spectacular beauty of this world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192acc334fd970d.jpg "Endless vacation means enjoying the spectacular beauty of this world")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192acc334fd970d.jpg)

Alas, there are as many ways of doing it as there are people doing it..so each must find their own route.

I think the first step is saving money, living a frugal and [minimalist life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/minimalist-family-frugal-tip-omg.html "minimalist family "), [clearing out "stuff](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "consumerism in USA")" ( make money on your used items) and finding out ways to make a living on the move.  
  
**TEACH ENGLISH TO FUND TRAVEL ...AND MORE**

Have you looked into teaching English? This is one of the easiest and most popular ways to do this.Or if you or your husband have college degrees ..get jobs teaching at an international school in places like [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "China travel") or Korea and save up for a year or two from that base ( where all expenses and housing is covered)..plus [vacation travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/the-ultimate-tahiti-vacation-on-a-backpacker-low-budget.html "vacation travel backpacker budget tahiti") the area....then use that money earned to travel/live for a while.

If you own a home...some sell to get money, others rent it out to pay for travel.  
  
**PICK LOW COST AREAS**

[Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/asia/ "Asia travel") and South America are low cost living areas...so one finds a TON of people in these areas living this life and backpacking types living on little successfully.

Some even get rich ( like [Tim Ferris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/the-4hour-workweek-review-by-world-traveling-family-rich-global-digital-lifestyle-design.html "tim ferriss 4 hour work week") or [Chris Guillebeau.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/advice-to-college-grads-from-a-world-traveler.html "tips for college grads")..who have fab books on this topic with great tips...although both are based in the US and just travel part time).

BUT most don't get rich...they do it for the freedom.  
  
[![Permacation in Tahiti...on  a cheap budget](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901f043adc970b.jpg "Permacation in Tahiti...on  a cheap budget")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901f043adc970b.jpg)

**SLOW TRAVEL TIPS**  
  
If you live simply in a cheap place ( or even expensive place)...rural areas are cheaper too and more [family friendly](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html "family friendly travel tips") as is [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel")...this is really doable for most anyone. You don't have to make the same kind of money you do in the USA or other expensive countries.

I've known a family of minimal means with 8 kids who did it, a single mom with 5 kids and parents with handicap kids who have done it, even a guy who did it for years on absolutely no money ( before the internet) ...so truly if there is a will there is a way.  
  
**HOW MUCH SAVINGS?**

I think it is good to have some savings to back you up, but some do it without and [travel the world.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "world travel and homeschool high school")..some with kids...never knowing where the next buck is coming from.

Much depends on your comfort levels and goals. Like most people who retire early, we sacrificed for years and lived under our means...and still do...we watch every penny...as we know that is the key to our freedom...as we are not [trust fund babies](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/do-you-have-to-be-rich-like-suri-cruise-to-world-school-learn-mandarin-.html "you don't have to be rich like suri cruise").

**TRAVEL WILL NOT TAKE PROBLEMS AWAY**

Today there is no safe place to keep or grow your saved money really, so even with that option there are risks. We mostly live off our investments and grow them as we roam the world.

Whether one travels or stays home, there are always risks and choices in life...and never any certainties.

A [travel life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/how-to-prevent-travel-burnout.html "travel life - how to prevent burn out") will not take all problems away, and in fact, will add different ones and some will remain no matter where you are...as that is life.

So like most things in life...the fantasy of a [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel lifestyle") is different than the reality. You can't really know what that is until you do it. Like every life, it has pros and cons.

For us it is a great choice..but obviously not every body loves this lifestyle..for this long.  
  
[![Life is a beach when you are on a permanent vacation...kiddo enjoying Barcelona pool](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192acc33b43970d.jpg "Life is a beach when you are on a permanent vacation...kiddo enjoying Barcelona pool")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192acc33b43970d.jpg)  
  
**CHOOSING A PERMANENT VACATION IS EASY ONCE YOU COMMIT**

I will say, that the thought of doing this is MUCH more intimidating than actually doing it. Before we left and sold our home, it seemed like an impossible goal.

Like most things in life, you get a plan, research how others have done it for ideas, then tweak for your specifics, then commit and DO it ( with flexibility and back up plans).

If it doesn't work out, you can go to plan B,C,D etc or go back home.

If we had not liked our choice...that is what we would have done...gone back home and made up a new plan...but obviously we like this better.

**WANT A PRIVATE CONSULT ON HOW TO TRAVEL THE WORLD ON A LOW BUDGET?**

I get so many questions and requests ( more than I can keep up with), so I am now doing private consulting via skype for $30/hr if you ever want to do that.  
  
What would you like to know about living a permanent vacation?

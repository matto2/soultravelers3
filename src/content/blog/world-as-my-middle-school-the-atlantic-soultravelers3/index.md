**SOULTRAVELERS3 IN _THE ATLANTIC_**  
  
I loved this brilliant article in The Atlantic, ["_Paris Was My Middle-school classroom_"](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/paris-was-my-middle-school-classroom/281489/ "PARIS WAS MY MIDDLE-SCHOOL CLASSROOM") and appreciate that they mentioned and linked to our Soultravelers3 blog.

**WHY TRAVEL AND EDUCATION WORK SO WELL TOGETHER**  
  
I thought the author, [Ms. Burton](http://www.theatlantic.com/tara-isabella-burton/ "author tara isabella burton") made some excellent, specific points about how that experience had enhanced her learning and life path, thanks to the advantages and freedom of [travel schooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "homeschooling gifted child through travel").  
  
![Travel teen Mozart doing science experiment at Perot science museum - unschool middle school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d989cf5970d.png)  
  
**IS WORLD TRAVEL JUST FOR THE RICH?**  
  
I was quite surprised by the many negative comments. Although they acknowledged that this was indeed, an amazing way to learn, most said it was ONLY available for the very rich who are  born with a "silver spoon".  
  
![Travel teen Mozart art gallery and museum hopping  in Santa Fe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcddc371970b.png)  
  
**WORLD AS CLASSROOM -LITERALLY**  
  
It saddens me that even today, so few realize how possible and easy this is if one WANTS to give their child this kind of exemplary education. They should listen to our [travel kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "Mozart - most well traveled kid")'s advice in [13 year old Mozart's inspiring speech](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/kid-world-citizens-inspiring-speech-at-global-education-conference.html "Mozart's inspiring speech at Global education conference") at the [Global Education Conference](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "trilingual teen Mozart inspiring speech global education conference") or her opinion on [why travel with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "why travel with kids").

So of course, I had to comment from our experience and hope it encourages others to think differently to find _their own way_ for more freedom in educating their kids..even on a tiny budget.

**TRAVEL THE WORLD TO EDUCATE YOUR CHILD**  
  
You certainly have a valid point, but I can tell you that this and more IS available to MANY more ordinary people than is often realized and is a growing trend. I just discovered this because we were mentioned in this article.

Today, most can work, live, school ANY where if they want to ( if you can work at home, you can work in Rome!) and [traveling the world to educate your child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/learning-while-traveling-travel-homeschool-road-school-abroad-5-best-reasons.html "traveling the world to educate your child") can actually be MUCH cheaper than living in the USA.

**PRIMARY SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL AROUND THE WORLD**  
  
We're not just doing middle school in [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/paris-travel-with-kids.html "paris travel with kids") and [Italy,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/italy-with-kids-travel-tips.html "Italy travel with kids") we've been on an [open ended world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing family world tour") to [educate our daughter around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "educate child through travel") ( 46 countries on 5 continents) the last 8 plus years ( her entire primary years from 5 years to 13) on just $23/day per person!

**TRAVEL **AND** LANGUAGES**  
  
We're monolingual parents and she is fluent-as-a-native trilingual/triliterate in [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "Blond American kid Mozart  fluent in Mandarin"), [Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning Spanish in Spain") and English and will soon add French.

 **MUSIC, MOZART AND TRAVEL**  
  
She is a [talented musician](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "travel kid Mozart talented singer, songwriter, musician") too, so the first kid since Mozart to do [extensive world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "extended travel") with a [violin and piano](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/mozart-plays-mozart-and-more-violin-and-piano-performance.html "travel teen Mozart playing violin and piano performance") ( and just added the [didgeridoo in Sydney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/best-place-to-buy-a-didgeridoo-in-sydney-gifts-at-the-quay.html "didgeridoo in Sydney") and a guitar in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/california-winter-beach-escape-.html "Calfornia winter beach escape")).

**TRAVEL AND ENDLESS EDUCATIONAL POSSIBILITIES**  
  
She is already far beyond age peers in her education ( just completed a senior year high school class online in Asia with Johns Hopkins University CTY ...on a scholarship...and got an A, will soon easily test out of AP Mandarin and AP Spanish classes for both high school and college credit), has much more free time than most tweens, has become a budding [entrepreneur teaching her 3 languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/best-classes-or-tutor-for-spanish-english-or-mandarin-in-penang.html "travel teen Mozart teaching 3 languages") to adults and kids around the world since 12 with a long waiting list, is writing a kids book series about each country she has been to and got her first paid singing gig at a huge Chinese wedding in Asia singing in Mandarin, [won a Mandarin Elocution contest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/best-classes-or-tutor-for-spanish-english-or-mandarin-in-penang.html "beautiful blond travel teen Mozart won Chinese eloction contest") in a 1000-kid Chinese high school and recently was the [youngest presenter at the Global Educational Conference.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/11/global-citizen-innovative-kid-speaker-at-global-education-conference.html "travel teen Mozart youngest speaker at Global Eduation Conference")

**YOU DON'T NEED TO BE RICH TO TRAVEL**  
  
It's true that many wealthy folks are putting their kids ( like [Suri Cruise](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/do-you-have-to-be-rich-like-suri-cruise-to-world-school-learn-mandarin-.html "suri cruise and education")) in traveling immersion schools that focus on Mandarin, Spanish fluency and cultural advantages of [long term travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/long-term-family-travel-most-important-item.html "long term travel as a family") as an educational aid for 21st century kids in our shrinking world, BUT if you don't happen to have the 80 grand a year that takes, with a little creativity and open mindedness, you can do even better on your own, have more time with your kid and enjoy a more free life... living outside of the box.  
  

![Travel tween Mozart exploring Petra by Camel - homeschooling around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcddc843970b.png)  
  
**FAMILY TRAVEL CAN BE CHEAP**  

Neither [world class travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "world class travel") or a [world class education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html "world class education") has to be expensive. I didn't know this was possible before we did it, but I can tell you that it was absolutely the best decisions of our lives! Instead of assuming it can't be done, start reading things like the [4Hour Workweek](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/the-4hour-workweek-review-by-world-traveling-family-rich-global-digital-lifestyle-design.html "4 hour workweek") ( we were case studies in it) and finding ways to make it happen if you have this kind of dream for your child.

Trust me, this great Goodman quote is NOT normal ( and you don't have to be rich to live a rich life):

“Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work and  
driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for - in  
order to get to the job you need to pay for the clothes and the car, and  
the house you leave vacant all day so you can afford to live in it.”

What do you think? Do you find ways to use travel and multicultural experiences to enrich your child's education and life experience? Or is this only for the most wealthy?  
  
Like every life, not every moment has been perfect bliss with nary a problem, but we are all extremely grateful for the risks and choices we have made as an ordinary family, to educate our child and have [more time together](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/-father-daughter-relationships.html "families more time together").

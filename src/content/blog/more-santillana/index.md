It is soon obvious why this entire town is a national monument, where not a stone can be moved.  It is the perfect size to walk around in and [every corner has something delicious](http://getaway.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=255831) for the eyes to see, not to mention lots of tempting food choices. I got a kick out of the fact that they had lots of "designer" beans in fancy packages to sell, since we love them.

Mozart had fun running from one store to another, watching the horses eat and we enjoyed the beauty of the village, along with the verdant nature all around. We met an interesting man who had the most awesome store filled from top to bottom in such an artistic way. It had been there for thirty years and he had lots of tales to tell. My mom had a little store like that back in Capitola for years, so reminded me a bit of that.

Mozart found a lovely toy store with the sweetest owner, so between the two of them, we were happily conned into buying a few small things, like a colorful barrette. Mozart suddenly has a passion to comb her bangs far to one side ( she must have seen a teen do this), thus we will have to find someways to help her grow them out.

The strangest thing in this town in the [Torture museum](http://www.travelintelligence.com/travel-writing/1001302/Europe/Spain/Cantabria/Santillana-del-Mar/Santillana-del-Mar.html). I am MUCH to squeamish for such things, perhaps a past life memory? In any case, I took a rest, while those two explored that particular gem. They both found it quite fascinating,which is not too surprising since Mozart loves [Horrible histories](http://www.amazon.com/Ruthless-Romans-Horrible-Histories-Terry/dp/0439982375/ref=pd_sim_b_1/103-4053197-3804664)  and [Grossology](http://www.amazon.com/Grossology-Sylvia-Branzei/dp/0843149140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224235438&sr=1-1). ( Two great ways to homeschool lots of useful information, effortlessly, since it appeals to kids and they they don't even realize they are learning while pouring over them with passion!)

There was a very nice hotel there that let us use their free wifi  which was a great help because there was no wifi at the campsite, only expensive metered machines on Spanish dated computers. Thank you! ( I tried to find it again online, but can't seem to, but it was beautiful on the main road in the center).This outdoor restaurant was part of it.

The best trick for finding free wifi on the road is to ask and ask again, until you find it. Soon I am going to do a post on some of the great and not so great places where we make our "mobile offices" with laptops on the move while traveling the world. Our "three laptop family" has become experts on this fine art and this was one of our luxurious finds! There is nothing quite like soaking up the benefits of a 5 star hotel for free.

The spectacular Puy du Fou theme park is one of the best family travel gems in France with outstanding shows that [educate and entertain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puy_du_Fou) and puts  Disney to shame. We were absolutely blown away by [the quality](http://www.puydufou.com/uk/) of the shows and can not [recommend it](http://travel.ciao.co.uk/Le_Grand_Parc_Puy_Du_Fou__6543824) high enough. 

The chariot race in this photo took place in a coliseum and they were going fast! They even had live lions and tigers and was so well done that  it totally allows kids to get a real feel for history coming alive. I've been to lots of places and have never seen it done better. The falcon and birds of prey show was mind blowing  
(and we used a little  of that footage in our [Harry Potter video).

We will be writing more about this terrific place soon, but wanted to get a taste of it up, in case any one is planning a trip to France soon.

I also have been working on a Question and Answer post for the last several days which I planned to post today. It was loaded with great links which perhaps was too much for my very tempermental wifi here at our [Barcelona campground](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html) because I lost it all a few hours ago when I tried to upload it. Ugh. Thus, I decided to put this post up to at least have something up this week. I'll get back to that after I cool down over the loss.

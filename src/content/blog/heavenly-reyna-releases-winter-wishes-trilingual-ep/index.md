Inspired by hygge ( (pronounced hooga) an untranslatable Scandinavian practice of enjoying and embracing the joys of winter that evokes coziness, togetherness, inner warmth...which seems like something the world needs now. "Winter Wishes" releases tonight at midnight on the east coast and 9pm on the west coast and I am really looking forward to it, how about you?

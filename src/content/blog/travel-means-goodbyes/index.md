Just as travel means "hello" to new and [exciting adventures](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "exciting adventures"), it also means lots of saying "good bye" to dear ones we leave behind. Thankfully, we can keep up with family and friends as we [explore the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "explore the world") via Skype webcam talks and our very flexible [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "travel lifestyle") allows us to return regularly to the places and people we love.

We have found that we actually spend more time with family since we've been traveling than when we lived close by. Mozart had more time with her grandmother when she came to [visit us in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "traveling with grandma") and in this four month [California visit](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California visit") than she had the many years we lived nearby. She also got to spend more quality time with her aunts on both sides and other relatives.  
  
Some how when you live nearby and everyone is busy with life, there just isn't as much quality or quantity time as one would assume, but by being away we are all much more aware of how much we value each other. It's been a great extended stay, but we are ready for more adventure and Asia awaits!

We value relationships, so [consciously support our child's friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "supporting kids friendships") and family relationships, but also think these repeated "good byes" and "hellos" enrich Mozart. It helps us all live more in the now which is all we really have, isn't it? Mozart has always been a flexible kid who loves change, but I have observed this lifestyle making her even better at [making new friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "making new friends") and saying good byes.  
  
Life is full of change and transitions, so a good thing to learn I think, especially with the strong attachment parenting bond that we have and [our travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "our travel lifestyle") done in a thoughtful way. As you read this, we will be on a 23 hour flight [to Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "extended travel to Asia") and very ready for another new beginning as well as super grateful for our extended stay in California with family.  
  
How about you? How are you with good byes and transitons? Aren't "goodbyes" always part of travel?

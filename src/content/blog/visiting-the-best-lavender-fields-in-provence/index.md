At 16, [Mozart](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2017/06/mozartignitetour-in-europe-mozart-dees-keynote-speech.html "Mozart Dee singer/songwriter and actress in Europe") was a great age to enjoy this [summer travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2017/05/best-of-europe-summer-trip-.html#more "best summer travel in Europe ") in a deeper way, adding layers of experience from her times before in [Provence](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/10/beautiful-provence-tips-and-photo-avignon-france-.html "Provence travel ") at different ages, yet seeing it all anew from her more mature teen perspective. This was a perfect location for a mother-daughter trip and a big plus that Mozart also got to [perform concerts](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVkZdPGHEOb/?taken-by=muzicbymozart "Mozart Dee performing in Provence ") in this quintessential, charming French area.

These famed lavender fields tantalize your senses and for only one month out of the year this spectacular blue- violet and green show spreads through the hillsides and valleys of Provence with the calming, healing aroma of lavender, the brilliant sunshine, buzzing bees and soothing sound of the cicadas.

After Newcastle, Edinburgh, London and Paris, our trip to Provence was perfectly timed to catch this harvest. The peak time for full bloom is mid July, but it varies each year and depends on location. Due to weather, it was early this year in the fields around Gordes, Apt and Roussillon, so a sweet bonus for us.

It's hard to explain how exciting it is to be out in the lavender fields in the Luberon. This is such an inspirational region because of the beauty, architecture, art, wine, cuisine,lifestyle and summer is the best season to  experience  all of that in full bloom and color.

 I always love to add learning to a trip, so I was so happy that our wonderful guide Corinne took us to the [Les Agnels Distillerie de Lavande](http://www.lesagnels.com "les agnels distillerie de lavande ") near Apt. One can enjoy a guided tour year round and it's a great place to learn about the history of lavender, how it is made and lots of products available as well.

We were happy to miss the crowds because we were there before high season, so we had the fields to ourselves pretty much.

It was also very quiet when we were learning all about lavender, so we didn't feel rushed...

 time outdoors in the fields.

 Since our guide has lived in this area her whole life, it was very enlightening to hear the stories of the artisan lavender growers

 and how that impacts life today and the whole history of it.

 I love the combo of olive trees and lavender that one sees in this area a lot. Mozart grew up with olive trees and lavender ( and pinot noir vineyard) as they lined our long driveway on the [home we sold in California](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "home and houses") to take our world tour, so this kind of ambiance resonates with us and perhaps why we love Provence, Tuscany, Spain and Med aesthetics. I love the light,  the sun, the food, the colors and the earthiness of it all.

 There is something calming and nurturing about this kind of environment that speaks to me.   
  
![lavender gifts from Provence ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c9100bbc970b.png)  
  
Even the gifts make me smile to be able to take a little of it home with us.   
  
![lavender field and pretty blonde girl ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d29a514d970c.png)  
  
I am grateful Mozart and I have another unique experience here to add to our memory banks.  
  
  
![olive trees and lavender fields in luberon Provence ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d29a5160970c.png)  
  
  
There is just something very special about experiencing a beautiful place together and the people we met are part of us now as well, knowing some day we will see them and this place again and it will be like no time has passed.   
  
  
![lavender in provence ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb09b34613970d.png)  
  
  
Provence, like lavender is always different, but yet also always the same in a timeless manner, year after year.

So we will be back to the Luberon and to all of Provence and to France and to Europe again soon and in the meantime we have our pictures to remind us of this special time, the aroma of lavender and Mozart has some extraordinary art photos from museums in Europe on her wall where she writes music on her piano and some show Provence and lavender. Unforgettable.   
  
Please share your Provence stories or future plans in the comments! I love hearing them.

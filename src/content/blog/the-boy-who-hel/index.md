The Boy Who Held Back the Sea  
We bought this book to prepare for the Netherlands and it is a beautiful retelling of the famous story of the little boy who held back the sea by putting his finger in the dike. The illustrations are visually stunning and done in the style of the 17th century Dutch landscape painters like Rembrandt and Vermeer. It also opens the way for discussions on the low land geography of Holland. It is skinny and portable too.

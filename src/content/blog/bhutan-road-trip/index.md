You will never forget a road trip around Bhutan, that picturesque Himalayan last Shangri La.  [Bhutan trave](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/travel-to-bhutan-.html "Bhutan travel")l is like no where else in the world so driving there you will see yaks, [nomads](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/family-travel-bhutan-nomads.html "bhutan nomads"), pristine nature, school children walking long distances and colorful trucks.  
  
Bhutan only had a road since the 1960's and driving  deep into Eastern Bhutan, the most isolated and sacred part, is an arduous, slow journey. We are happily haunted by our heavenly memories there and think [Bhutan is an amazing place for family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "bhutan amazing place for family travel") or [trekking the Tiger's Nest](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html "trekking the tigers nest, bhutan").  
  
Bhutan has only been open to the world since the 1970's and one can not help wonder how it will change and how lucky we were to visit this happiest country.  
  
We were blessed to be the first travel bloggers to be hosted by the amazing [Tourism Council of Bhutan.](http://www.tourism.gov.bt/ "Tourism Council of Bhutan") They all took wonderful care of us from the moment we arrived as they shared their beautiful country with us and it touched our hearts deeply.

Out of the many things on our recent [family trip to Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "family trip to Jordan") that truly blew us away was the food. I'd heard the food was great in Jordan, but didn't expect every meal to be absolutely scrumptious and healthy. It is not unusual to have 30 or 40 dishes served at a meal, so many temptations to please the eye and tickle the palate.  
  
As if [Petra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "petra"), [Wadi Rum](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/wadi-rum-bedouin-honeymoon-suite-.html "wadi rum") , the [Dead Sea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/dead-sea-delights-for-families.html?cid=6a00e5502a95078833015392ea097b970b "the Dead Sea Jordan") and the [Four Seasons](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/amazing-family-fun-at-four-seasons-amman.html "Four Seasons Hotel") are not enough, one could go to Jordan just to experience the local food. This wasÂ  a mouth watering meal that we had while visiting the [ancient city of Jerash](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/learning-vacations-educational-trips-that-teach-kids.html "jerash jordan ancient city"). Food played a tremendous role on our visit to Jordan. We ate in high end restaurants, on the street, in homes and with [Bedouins](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/bedouins-in-jordan.html "bedouins in jordan") including a traditional dish cooked in the sand!  
  
The primary style of eating in Jordan is done "mezze" style...small plates, sampler dishes, many appetizers, salads etc., typically rolled out before the savory main dishes. The sublime, fresh baked breads ( pita, shrak, abud) are meant to scoop and dip up the mouth-watering hummous, baba ghanouj and other dishes ( many healthy olive oil based and vegetarian).  
  
Jordan shares a deeply rooted, community based food culture with her neighbors in the Middle East. Have you tried this tempting traditional cuisine or do you want to?

When you take your [trip to China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "trip to China"), don't miss the  [Peking Opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_opera "Peking Opera") (京剧) while in [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/real-beijing-hutong-nights.html "Travel to Beijing"), for it is one of the top  "must-see" things if you are interested in [Chinese culture](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/the-beauty-of-traditional-chinese-culture.html "Chinese culture") or [learning Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "learning Mandarin"). Also known as Beijing Opera, it is over 200 years old and worth it for the stunning costumes alone, which fascinated me.  
  
Millions of overseas visitors [head to Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/panjiayuan-antique-market-beijing-best-gifts.html "Beijing best travel places") every year because it is a fantastic blend of old and new as well as the capital. Peking Opera is based here and is a national treasure. It's a very stylized performance with elaborate makeup, clothes and sets that includes singing, dancing, and acrobatic fighting ( and sounds strange to our ears).  
  
More details on this soon, but I wanted to at least get this Beijing Opera travel photo up to give you a taste of our unique-to-us evening of entertainment. It's very different than [watching Opera in Verona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/italy-dont-miss-romantic-verona-and-the-opera-.html "watching opera in Verona") as we did [in Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/family-travel-italy-verona-opera-carmen-aida-domingo-zeffirelli-family-friendly-educational-travel.html "family travel italy opera") on [our world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "our family world tour - nomadic lifestyle"), but impressive in it's own right.

You just don't see stunning stone houses like this one in [France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/france/ "travel france tips") any where in the world like you do in [Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "camping Europe, best sites") and it is one of the reasons we love that continent so much.

Don't you love the charming details of the red picket fence, matching wooden door and rail plus bright flowers in boxes all around, surrounded by greenery? How it enhances the natural stone! These are the kind of picturesque sites in [Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/europe-road-trip-a-drive-through-france-provence-to-dordogne-via-photos-family-travel.html "road trip Europe") that warm my romantic soul like reading a Jane Austen novel wrapped in a duvet on a comfy bed or eating delicious French or Italian food.

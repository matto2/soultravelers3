We [traveled to China in the fall](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "China travel in fall") and returned to [tropical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/02/escaping-winter-in-tropical-asia.html "escaping winter in tropical Asia") just before [Christmas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "Christmas abroad"), so it was very cold by the time we left.

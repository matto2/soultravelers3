Cooking in [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-family-vacation-beauty-love-joy-.html "China family vacation"), [restaurants](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/chinese-restaurants-in-china-.html "Chinese restaurants in China") and the [food in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/food-in-china.html "food in China") is quite fascinating. Cooking in all of [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/awesome-asian-coconut-rickshaw-photo.html "Asia photo"), seems very different than the west. We [traveled to China in the fall](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "China travel in fall") and returned to [tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/escaping-winter-in-tropical-asia.html "escaping winter in tropical Asia") just before [Christmas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "Christmas abroad"), so it was very cold by the time we left. This didn't stop people from cooking and eating outside...a very popular activity all over Asia.  
  
I thought all the cooking outside was a [tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical winter in Penang") thing,due to the heat, but I learned that it doesn't matter what the weather, as they just put on warm clothes and got some coal for the homemade stoves. It's more about making money I think and part of the culture and the original fast food.  
  
This was taken at the beginning of the Silk Road in [Xian](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-travel-shopping-and-markets-rtw.html "shopping xian china"), so people have probably been cooking just like this in the same location for hundreds of years.  
  
[Exploring food while traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/yum-loving-the-food-in-beijing.html "food in Beijing") is one of the great joys, don't you think?

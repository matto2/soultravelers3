**1) KIDS MAKE IT MORE FUN!**  
  
What could be more fun than [seeing the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "homeschool through travel") through your child's eyes? I loved [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling the world digital nomad") as a single, as a couple and with groups, but nothing beats [traveling the world as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "trilingual Mozart speaks at GEC about family travel education").

**2) TRAVELING IS MORE EDUCATIONAL THAN A TEXT BOOK**  
  
The world is getting smaller and there is no [better education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "Family Travel, Homeschool, Education & Global Student") for our global citizens of the 21st century than world travel. Mozart has had little formal schooling yet she got better than most seniors on her SAT test at 13 and graduated high school at 14 and now about to start college at just 14.

**3) TRAVEL MAKES KIDS MORE CREATIVE**  
  
When you are always out of your element, one becomes an excellent, creative problem solver and uses creativity to entertain oneself as well when living with a different sense of time that traveling creates.

**4) YOU GET TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER  
  
**Bonding is one of the greatest advantages of extended travel, but even for a short vacation, having more time together just relaxing is a big part of the joy.

**5) KIDS MEAN SLOW TRAVEL AND THAT IS MORE ENRICHING  
  
**You can not push and rush kids or you get very cranky travelers and that is not fun at all. So kids encourage slow travel and that is really the best way to travel and get to know a place.

**6) KIDS MAKE IT EASY TO MEET PEOPLE  
  
**Many people are attracted to kids, especially if you have a blonde in a land where everyone has dark hair! So that makes it very easy, but no matter where we were in the world, even in Scandinavia where blondes were the norm, we found having a child in tow made it so much easier to meet people. Mozart would make friends with people of every age.

**7) TRAVEL MAKES YOU ALL MORE ADAPTABLE AND FLEXIBLE  
  
**Things don't always go as planned in regular life, and that seems to often be compounded when you are traveling, especially with a child or children. So one learns to be ever adaptable and flexible and this seems like such a great attribute to grow up with.   
  
[![The Top 10 Reasons to Travel with Kids - Mozart in Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c7bda1d3970b.png "The Top 10 Reasons to Travel with Kids - Mozart in Beijing")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c7bda1d3970b.png)  
  
  
**8) KIDS BENEFIT BY BEING AROUND OTHER LANGUAGES AND CULTURES  
  
**It is so important to be the minority sometimes and to know what that feels like and to be somewhere that you do not understand a word of the language or the customs. It truly expands the mind and allows one to embrace life in a bigger form. Our travels also allowed Mozart to become fluent & literate in Spanish and Chinese like a native and that is a great gift that will last her a lifetime.

**9) TRAVELING WITH KIDS CREATES LIFELONG SHARED UNIQUE MEMORIES  
**  
No one has family memories like we do and it is one of the things that bonds us. We remember all the good as well as the challenges and the wonderful people we met along the way. Travel as a family just gives you the best memories![![The To

**10) TRAVELING WITH KIDS MEANS YOU MAKE TIME FOR PLAY  
**  
If we hadn't traveled as a family, I am sure we would have missed all those swims in the pools or ocean and going to theme parks and such that kids like. We would never taken so much time to play and that enriched us greatly. **[![The Top 10 Reasons to Travel with Kids](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb0861ec1d970d.png "The Top 10 Reasons to Travel with Kids")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb0861ec1d970d.png)

[Halloween](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/best-halloween-europe-or-us-conde-nast-youtube-video-social-media-twitter-nyc-wendy-perrin.html) has become a popular holiday in Barcelona in the last 5 years. It doesn’t have the pomp and hype like  in the US, but rather a unique traditional feel that sets it apart from most European countries. It is Halloween and Castañada. Some fusion has occurred, but the external tradition remains. In the above photo of a bakery in Barcelona, you see the local traditional pastries along with the spooky and fall Halloween decorations of jack-o'-lantern pumpkins and bats.

Each region celebrates a little differently.

Historically, Catalans celebrate All Saints’ Day (1st November) by going to church and visiting family graves with flowers, candles & prayers in remembrance of the dead. They also celebrate _La Castanyada_, either on the 1st November or the 31st October, by eating roasted chestnuts and sweet bread rolls known as _panallets._

Spain selling [Halloween costumes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/10/happy-halloween-diy-cute-cheap-costume.html) and spooky season clothes and decorations is a fairly new thing in Barcelona.We were surprised as we walked by some of these store windows this week.There are many expats living in Barcelona so I am sure that has some influence. As well as TV, movies and the internet. But Spaniards know how to make it their own.

Autumn in Barcelona is magical because the Mediterranean weather is still relatively sunny and warm. Yet, like most places in Europe, the foliage changes colors and begins to fall off trees. While much of the fall foliage in North America takes on a fiery red hue, autumn leaves in Europe are mostly yellow & golden in color. We enjoy taking walks enjoying these beautiful autumn colors beneath a gorgeous canopy like this photo in Gaudi's Guell Park this week.

Thanks to Barcelona’s prime locale in the Mediterranean region of coastal Spain, the city enjoys the best of both worlds in terms of weather. It is not hot like summer here, but more like [California Halloween](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/enchanting-halloween-california-style-1.html) weather, warm and delightful!

Most Mediterranean trees are perennial and never lose their leaves (like pine trees, or palms).

There are less red leaf colors in Barcelona area, but you do find some. So a magnificent combo of the best of both worlds.

Barcelona in late October offers a perfect blend of Halloween spookiness and rich culture. You can still dine outside or enjoy a cup of coffee in  the many outdoor cafes. The crowds are lighter and prices lower. There are endless events happening like this year a Picasso and Miro show.

One can mingle with nature in Barcelona as the parks and natural areas convert into an enchanting canvas of autumn colors. We strolled through Gaudi's house in  Park Güell and enjoyed the rustling leaves, the scent of fallen chestnuts & lovely jazz music by a street musician.

Halloween in Spain is mainly observed as a children’s holiday.  At the luxury camping resort we stay at it is a big weekend for local Spaniards to bring their kids.

 This is a fairly recent occasion. We have been coming here regularly for almost twenty years with our [vintage camping van](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/03/camper-van-renovation-vanlife-begins-again.html).  As I went on my [morning walk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/04/morning-walks-beautiful-flower-photos.html) on Halloweekend, the central  big video screen was showing this pumpkin scene and playing music.

That is me on Halloweekend in one of the 3 huge pools here at our camping resort. I loved having it all to my self at around noon! The music was playing and the beauty surrounding me was like a tantalizing movie. BUT the [water was cold](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-water-therapy#weight-loss), so only for the brave. It was a bit hard to get into, but once I was in it, I felt great.

It is just fast train stop away from us and also easy to get to from Barcelona. I've got it on my bucket list for next year maybe!  
  
During Halloween Season, from 24 September to 13 November 2023, the park is transformed into a spooky, horror fantasyland, with amazing decorations, music, costumes, shows, and activities. One American expat Halloween fanatic loved it and called it "Halloween on STEROIDS!!!!! ".

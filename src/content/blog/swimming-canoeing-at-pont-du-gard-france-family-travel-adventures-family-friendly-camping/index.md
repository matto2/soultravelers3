When we first discovered the [UNESCO World Heritage](http://whc.unesco.org/) Site, [Pont de Gard](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/pont-du-gard.html), very early on our [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) in the fall of 2006, we were surprised that we loved it so much and that it was one of those places that are better than any pictures or video can portray. We decided to see it again on this years [road trip through Provence,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html) to experience it in the summer in full bloom.

The[" Le Pont du Gard"  museum](http://www.pontdugard.fr/page.php?rub=328&langue=GB) here is fantastic, thus from a [homeschool educational travel perspective](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html), it is a perfect place to do a [unit study of sorts on ancient Roman times](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/roman-holiday-i.html) again, especially after just seeing the two arenas and Roman ruins in [Nimes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-nimes-france-.html) and [Arles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-arles-france-.html). We stayed at a [La Sousa](http://www.eurocampings.co.uk/en/europe/france/languedoc-roussillon/gard/campsite-la-sousta-100522/) campground that is in close walking distance to [Pont du Gard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_du_Gard) which we [liked much better the first time we visited](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/lazy-wifi-days.html) it when we had the place to ourselves and the free wifi worked.  It is extremely crowded in the summer high season, the staff is very grouchy, the nightly entertainment is loud and the free wifi is all but useless. That said, we lucked out with a fairly large,  private pitch in the woods not far from the play area and pool plus enjoyed tubing down the private, rocky beach, so we stayed a while again. Like most campgrounds in Europe, at [La Sousa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/lazy-wifi-days.html) they make fresh baguettes and pastries every morning and have store, restaurant ( lousy) and kids clubs.

There are a few things that one can do in the summer that can not be done in the fall, like [canoe under the Pont du Gard](http://www.pontdugard.fr/page.php?rub=347&langue=GB) which is quite a spectacular way to see and experience it. I was a bit worried if I could make it with my [mobility challenges and bad arm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html), but we managed as it is quite easy, but even the shortest, easiest route is a bit too long. We loved doing it, but we were exhausted by the time we finished and my bad arm was really sore ( both of DaVinci's were also sore the next day). We slept well that night! The hardest part for me was getting in and out of the canoe as they don't make that easy, provide no help with that and there were no other people our age canoeing. I am glad that we did the canoeing here instead of [the Dordogne](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/darling-dordogne-vacation-holiday-for-families-in-france.html) where we had also attempted to do it as this river is mostly very gentle and it doesn't get more challenging until after the Pont du Gard ( when unfortunately one is most tired). We wish it had stopped there so we could have just walked back to our campsite. Stopping for a picnic along the way and jumping out to swim ( or turn the canoe around from going backwards), was all part of the fun.

We also all loved tubing the river on other days, especially Mozart. It's really a perfect setting for kids as long as they keep their eyes out for the canoes who usually have people who are generally clueless on how to steer them. The water was fast enough in the center to make for a good ride, but also easy enough to get off and walk back at any point. It was a much faster flowing river in the fall when we visited and too cold to canoe, swim or tube then. It's great for families to be able to combine [learning about Romans](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/roman-holiday-i.html) while having so much fun. There were also lots of minnows to catch with nets and places to fish from the banks.

One other special that they only do in the summer, is light up the Pont du Gard. We wanted to see that too, but were quite surprised that it is not just lit up, but a real light show every night in July and August. All the colors and only a few people out viewing it, make it quite a special experience. Definitely put Pont du Gard on your list, but perhaps check one of the other many campgrounds in the area.

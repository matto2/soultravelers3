Don't you think every kid should know the joy of a family trip to Europe? There are so many amazing family friendly destinations in Europe it is often hard to decide where to go. We've spent 5 years exploring Europe as a family on just $23/day per person, on our extended [European road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "European road trip"), thus we can guide you with some tips to keep expenses down and have fantastic fun for every family member.

**FRANCE**  
  
The number one travel destination in Europe is France, so that might be a great place to begin! [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/paris-bois-de-b.html "Paris family travel") is the most visited city in the world and the Eiffel Tower the most seen attraction. Kids love icons and [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/paris-france-travel-guide-by-mozart.html "Paris guide") is full of them with [great museums](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/3-museums-in-a.html "Paris museums with kids") and sensational parks.  
  
You can combine [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/-family-travel-paris-france-louvre-photo.html "Paris family travel") with London or [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/paris-travel-with-kids.html "Paris family travel") with other parts of France like the [French Riviera](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beach-fun-french-riviera-style-france-family-travel-bucket-and-spades-provence-south-of-france.html "french riviera") and particularly [pretty Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/good-morning-pr.html "provence with kids"). Here are just a few informative posts I've written about [our travels in France](http://soultravelers3new.local/france/ "Our travels in france") from well known sights like [celebrating at the Eiffel Tower](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "celebrating Paris at Eiffel Tower") to hidden gems like [beautiful village Colliore](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html "beautiful village colliore").

**SPAIN**  
  
You know we love Spain best of all and the diversity, beauty, [food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "making paella in spain") and rich culture is why we made [Southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/andalusia-pleasures.html "southern spain andalusia") our winter home for four winters and have been to [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "barcelona travel") 16 times as a family, usually for months at a time. It is easy to combine quaint villages, gorgeous countryside, exquisite cities rich in history, the [best festivals in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/worlds-best-carnival-celebration-spain-photos-kids-family-travel-fun-adventure-lent-in-andalusia.html "best festivals in europe"), plus glorious mountains and sea.  
  
My best advice for Spain is to avoid most of coastal Spain, especially Andalusia in July and August for that is the time to be in Galicia. [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/family-travel-spain-photo-andalusia.html "Andalusia") is a fantastic winter, spring and fall destination with endless exotic festivals.

**ITALY**  
  
Who doesn't like Italy, Italians and italian food? I use to live there, so had to take my family and explore more. Everybody loves Rome, Venice and Florence, but don't miss the countryside like [Tuscany](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html "Tuscany family travel camping") and special places like Cinque Terra, Verona and Pompeii. If you want to combine [Barcelona and Rome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-rome.html "barcelona to rome ferry") plus a sea adventure,  there is a luxurious cruise-like ferry that runs daily.  
  
Here are just a few of our posts from our many explorations around Italy:

**UK and IRELAND**  
  
Many Americans like to begin in Europe in the UK and/or Ireland because the similar culture and language makes it easy and many of us have roots there. Most people just see the cities, but there are some amazingly verdant hills in a scrumptious countryside. We were  especially fond of the Cottsworld,Lake District and Dingle.  
  
Do remember that rain and cold 'tis the usual weather, even in summer, so bring your umbrellas and let the kids splash in some puddles. You might luck out with some sunny days, but if you are prepared then you will have fun no matter what the weather does.

**SCANDINAVIA**  
  
Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark are all wholesome family friendly destinations. The big surprise for us was how great the food was and that everyone speaks English...even the grandparents!  The roads in Scandinavia are excellent as are the trains and I think it may well be the most idyllic place to be for summer.

Here is a bonus tip on how to [eat healthy and cheaply while in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "how to eat healthy and cheap in Europe")! I realize I've still left out lots of countries and places in Europe that we love, so I will have to do more of these kind of posts. What are your favorite spots in Europe for kids?

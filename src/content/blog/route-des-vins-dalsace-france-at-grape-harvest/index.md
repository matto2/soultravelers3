This is the first video in our Soultravelers3 series about touring great wine regions of the world! Late this past fall of 2008, we arrived in Colmar, France and the many beautiful ancient wine villages along the Alsace route des Vins.  
  
  
  
Our 7 year old "Mozart" who has been visiting vineyards since she helped put a small Pinot Noir one in with her daddy at 5 months old in California, loved picking these very sweet grapes. We did not know then that she would be spending her childhood running through famous vineyards around the world!  
  
The autumn colors were as beautiful as any painting and surprisingly there were very few tourists around. We had just left behind the Romantic Road in Germany and were delighted to discover this area of France (near both Switzerland and Germany borders) which has a unique heritage making a German/French mix.  
  
The stunning wine road winds it's way through 170 kms of vineyards, medieval castles, Vosges forests, Romanesque churches and picturesque villages.  
  
We were based at a campground in Colmar which is known for it's historic beauty, gourmet foods and hospitality. What fun to explore their "little Venice" and do some wine tasting, shopping & museum exploring as we walked about. They had one of the best museums of armor that we have seen.  
  
The wines of Alsace are always presented in a tall slender bottle and come from 7 grape varieties: Sylvaner, Pinot Noir, Pinot Blanc, Riesling, Muscat d'Alsace, Tokay Pinot Gris, and Gewurztraminer.  
  
We loved this song by talented singer Emilie-Claire Barlow who graciously allowed us to use it. Please buy her music on her website:

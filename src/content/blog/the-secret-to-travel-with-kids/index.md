I've [traveled the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/around-the-world-family-travel/ "around the world travel") as a single, a couple, in groups, but I think the [best travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html "best tips for family travel") is [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "family travel around the world") as seeing the world through your child's eyes is magical.

**"DOING ORDINARY THINGS IN EXTRAORDINARY PLACES**" **~ JEANNE DEE**  
  
My best quote about traveling with kids is that "family travel is all about doing ordinary things in extraordinary places". I think that is the BEST secret for family travel with kids!

A perfect example is the idyllic August and September we spent in [Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/family-travel-photo-absolut-ice-bar-in-stockholm-sweden.html "family travel photo sweden ice bar in Stockholm"). Much of that time was spent in a lovely cottage on a family farm with a dear friend that I met on the internet long before our children were born.

We explored the local sights in nearby Linkoping and even miraculously stayed the night in a Safari tent at the zoo where my friend was working! Much of the fun was just sharing the ordinary life of the family, grandparents, cooking together, learning about mushroom foraging, [reindeer meat](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html "eating reindeer meat while traveling sweden"), crayfish and so much more about Swedish culture and family life.

Besides fun things like feeding the chickens & playing with the boys, one happy memory for Mozart was waiting for the ice cream truck and buying one.

A very ordinary moment in many children's every day life, but when you add the fact that it was in a foreign country, in a foreign language and treats she had never seen before, suddenly it becomes magical.  
  
[![ordinary extraordinary beauty in family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0c9e0a1970c.png "ordinary extraordinary beauty in family travel")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b8d0c9e0a1970c.png)  
  
Ordinary becomes extraordinary because of the location!  
  
[![Beautiful green scene](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c740537c970b.png "Beautiful green scene")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c740537c970b.png)  
  
Remembering that truck and it's distinctive "calling" song will be in Mozart's memory banks forever, just like her friends there and the opportunity to hear the unique Swedish Happy Birthday song sung to her by famous characters at the Pippi Longstocking museum in Stockholm where she celebrated her 8th!

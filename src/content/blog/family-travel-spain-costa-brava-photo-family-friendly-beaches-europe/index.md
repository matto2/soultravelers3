 One of the things we love about [Family Travel in Europe](Family travel in Europe "http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html"), are the charming  beaches. I love the old fashion feel like this one on the [Costa Brava](costa brava "http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/espana-costa-br.html"), not too far from [Barcelona](barcelona "http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html").  
  
They remind me of another time, like this looks like it could almost have been taken in the fifties or thirties. I love that timeless feel and think it is a good, wholesome perspective for a child. Love [Costa Brava?](costa brava "http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/good-day-sunshi.html#more")  Then check out this [best of Costa Brava](best of costa brava "http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/top-10-costa-brava-secret-gems-spain.html") post or this one on the  [Dali Museum](dali museum "http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/dali-musee-hot.html#more").  
  
Why do you love the beaches of Spain or Europe? We are in Bora Bora when this post goes up, so thinking beachy, but I may not have any internet connection while here.

How blessed are we  
to be on a non-stop family  
world tour since 2006?

How blessed are we to be on a [non-stop family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family world tour") since 2006? We actually started our "location independent" or "free range" lifestyle in 2005 when we [sold our dream home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "sold our dream home") and almost all of our possessions. It's definitely been the best decision of our lives! If I died today, I would be eternally grateful for the quantity and quality family time together and truly amazing travel experiences plus wonderful people that we have experienced together.  
  
As many awesome adventures that we have had in these last 6 years, we are up for more and continue to love this [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel lifestyle"). We feel totally blessed  that we have managed to explore 43 countries on 5 continents while staying on our $23/day per person low budget. As [Tim Ferriss](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/the-4hour-workweek-review-by-world-traveling-family-rich-global-digital-lifestyle-design.html "Tim Ferriss") said long ago about us, "You don't have to be rich to live a rich life".

As Mozart gets older, now 11, (so we're  realizing it is only 7 years until she is 18 - yikes!), we are especially grateful for the TIME together. Like the song, [Slipping Through My Fingers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbPsVknvg0Y "slipping through my fingers"), as parents of a tween, we are more aware than ever of the value of TIME together and how much more we have gotten by choosing this lifestyle.  
  
I am especially happy with the [TIME she gets with her father](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/happy-fathers-day-traveling-dads.html "daughter time with father"), so rare in this world. It was a scary and risky adventure when we set out to do this in 2005, stepping into the unknown, but for us, there is no doubt what so ever, that it was the right one. After this length of time, we can see the positive influence on Mozart and all of us, and that is gratifying.

It is typical of this time of year to review the past and look to what the future will bring. It is a good idea to consider where we have been, what we have learned and where we are going next.  Here are some of our reviews from the first 5 years of our world travels as a family:

2010 was a very exciting year because it was the first year that we went completely [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world family travel") and managed to do that luxuriously, cheaply and with just one carry-on piece of luggage each. After spending much of the summer in [Pyrennes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/family-travel-france-pyrenees-photo-highest-train-ride.html "Pyrennes"),  [Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/family-travel-provence-france-narbonne.html "Provence"), [French Riviera](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html "French Riviera"), Loire Valley and [Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/paris-france-travel-guide-by-mozart.html "Paris family travel"), we flew from Malaga to [London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "London travel BBC interview"), [NYC](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/airbnb-best-budget-lodging-for-nyc.html "New York City family travel airbnb"), San Francisco, 2 islands in [Hawaii](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/family-travel-hawaii-learning-to-surf-in-kauai.html "Family travel Hawaii"), LA, 3 places in Tahiti including [Bora Bora](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora") and [Moorea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/moorea-cheap-and-amazing.html "Cheap travel Moorea"), [New Zealand](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/beautiful-new-zealand-kia-kaha.html "New Zealand"), [Austrailia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/the-stunning-sydney-harbour-yha-hostel-review.html "australia"), [Singapore](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/03/top-hotel-for-luxury-fairmont-singapore.html "singapore") and finally landing in [Penang for Thanksgiving](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/first-thanksgiving-in-asia.html "Thanksgiving in southeast Asia") and our first [Christmas in tropical  Asia](http://www.soultrave

2011 pushed us all into new areas in tropical Asia including skipping our trilingual/triliterate 10 year old child from a fourth grade class [in Spain in an all Spanish schoo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "american girl in spain school")l to seventh grade in a 1000 kid all [Mandarin high school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "American kid in Mandarin school in Asia") in Asia. She was the youngest, smallest and only caucasian in the school. We were all a bit scared in the beginning, but it worked out wonderfully!

One of our great joys of 2011 was having Grandma do a long stay [3-generation travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "3 generation travel") visit with us in Asia for [Chinese New Year](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Chinese new year stunning photos"). It helped her have an  escape from [mourning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "tips on mourning") to build strength by being in an entirely new environment and allowed us to share our travel  life with her.

Sadly, I have been dealing with some [severe on again off again pain, dysbiosis](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health") and digestive problems ever since my Danish dentist gave me antibiotics in Spain in May 2010 which made me violently ill and my stomach has yet to recover. At times it has been a horrific challenge with pain at a 10 level on a scale of 1 to 10 and totally debilitating sometimes.  
  
The good news in that is it has slowed us down, which has been a blessing in disguise as we have come to really enjoy this [slower pace](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") that has been forced on us. We have all really learned a lot as well as great challenges tend to do, so put our focus on gratitude for that.  
  
We still managed to have some exciting adventures like several trips to Thailand, and being invited to [tour Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "family vacation bhutan") which we absolutely loved. We saw much of this unique and special country, the last Hymalayan Shangri- La,  and will be writing more about our time there.  
  
![Bhutan beauty- the last shangri-la](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833016760c1e611970b.jpg)

We were also invited to [Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "Jordan") which was a thrill as it and especially [Petra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "Petra") have long been on our list of places we wanted to see. We really loved Jordan, the food, the people, the sights and found it amazingly diverse and luxurious. We have many more stories to tell about our time in Jordan too.  
  
![Our family visiting Petra](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330162ffcd88d4970d.jpg)

Then we headed back to [Madrid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/taste-of-madrid.html "Madrid spain family travel"), Spain and onto [Southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "best southern spain vacation") where we all have dear friends that we have known now for 5 years. Kidlet was happy to visit and play with kids from our village and her [Spanish school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html "school in Spain") again. She lit up with delight when the Air Jordan flight attendant on the way to Madrid spoke in Spanish on the loud speaker,  as we had all missed being immersed in her second language.  
  
We spent most of the summer in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "barcelona food and friends") at our favorite resort ( also a bit in [Andorra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/grape-harvest-in-europe.html#more "Andorra"))  where we also have dear friends that we have known for five years. We had plans to [go to Romainia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/leaving-on-a-jet-plane-just-like-the-song-we-are-leaving-on-a-jet-plane-but-we.html "go to romania") and back to  [Budhapest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/family-travel-budapest-hungary-family-friendly-fun-and-educational.html "budhapest travel"), but that flight had to be cancelled at the last minute due to my health issues.  
  
It was fantastic just to relax and spend the time with our many friends and we were especially thrilled that we could meet up in [Barcelona with our dear Swedish friends.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/international-kids-water-fun-european-style.html "barcelona with kids")  
  
![Our favorite Barcelona beach resort](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833016760c1ffe6970b.jpg)  
  
We had planned an [exciting USA tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "USA road trip"), but my health narrowed it down to just a [Florida road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "florida road trip") and that was spectacular from [visiting Harry Potter's Wizarding World](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-kids-review.html "Visiting Wizarding World of Harry Potter") for Mozart's 11th birthday, to swimming with dolphins in Key West to [visiting Pensacola](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/florida-family-vacation-fun.html "visiting Pensacola") and more. LOT's more stories coming about that trip!  
  
![Swimming with dolphins in Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330162ffcda0b2970d.jpg)  
  
We ended 2011 with spending a glorious 3 months with family and doing some cool world schooling here.( More coming about that!).  Since we left in 2006, we have only been back twice and only for two weeks each, so this was a rare treat that each one of us enjoyed. Despite my health issues, being home for the holidays for this extended period has been a truly sacred time. Having lost fathers on both sides in 2010, it was important on many levels to have this extended stay.  
  
![reading the paper with Grandma](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330168e5c34e49970c.jpg)  
  
We plan to be off to tropical Asia again as soon as we can and do deeper explorations this year all around Asia. We've already been invited to China and India and want to explore many places like Bali, but above all else we want to remember the joys of slow travel and how much going slower this year has enriched us. Our primary goals this year is to increase kidlet's fluency in Mandarin ( especially reading and writing) and get me healthier than I have ever been.  
  
How about you? What are your travel plans for 2012?

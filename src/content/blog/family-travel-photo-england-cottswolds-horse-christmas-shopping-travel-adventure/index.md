As the Christmas countdown begins, we remember this fun family travel moment in the "heart of England" as a man on a horse went clomping by a [Bourton-on-the-Water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourton-on-the-Water) main street. It was in August 2008, but looks very Christmas-y to me with his red shirt and since I caught him right in front of that shop!

As you [know](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-england-cotswolds-church-heart-of-england.html) from [previous posts](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/swimming-with-swans-stratforduponavon-england-uk.html), we love the [Cotswolds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotswolds) and all the unique beauty and charm there. Mozart had a ball in Bourton-on-the-water navigating inside the [River Windrush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Windrush) that flows through the center and going under and on top of the beautiful pedestrian bridges than span it.

It's often called the Venice of the Cotswolds and when I post our full story of our visit, you will understand why. We're not really much of shoppers, but thought this looked like a great way to window shop and remind you that Christmas is just around the corner!

Mozart is joyfully starting her chocolate advent calendar today, I'm putting more attention into my daily meditation and adding more exercise. What are your plans for this month?

"Christmas gift suggestions: To your enemy, forgiveness. To an opponent, tolerance. To a friend, your heart. To a customer, service. To all, charity. To every child, a good example. To yourself, respect". - Oren Arnold

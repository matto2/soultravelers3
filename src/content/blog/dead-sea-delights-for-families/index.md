Who knew the Dead Sea was such a beautiful and healing delight that is fun for the whole family? Spring and fall are great times for a [family vacation to Jordan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "family vacation jordan"). You can see lots of photos of our [Jordan family trip here](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/05/jordan-tourismsmartest-.html "Jordan family trip"), but I will be writing lots more as I have time.  
  
Our first and last stop in Jordan was the [Dead Sea at the beautiful Movenpick Hotel](http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/hotels_resorts/worldmap/dead_sea/welcome.cfm "Movenpick dead sea resort and spa") and it's a perfect spot for families. Here you see our 10 year old enjoying a drink near the azure water after floating in the Dead Sea  and playing in several of the pools. They also have a kid's club there that she really enjoyed, not to mention the first class spa for the parents. The weather was perfect in late May and every day was sunny but not too hot.  
  
Looking for a peaceful, sunny, [luxurious place to vacation](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/amazing-family-fun-at-four-seasons-amman.html "Luxurious place to vacation Jordan") that is  rich in history and fabulous food?

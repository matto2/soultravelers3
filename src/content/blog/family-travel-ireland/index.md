The romance of old [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "ireland") can still be found today and makes the Emerald Isle a wonderful choice for family travel. Like so many Americans, we have genetic roots in Ireland. We loved the popular  [Ring of Kerry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Kerry) in [Killarney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killarney) National [Park](http://homepage.eircom.net/%7Eknp/muckross/index.htm) where they have traditional farms and gardens at the 19th century [Muckross House](http://www.muckross-house.ie/) that is like an open air museum with natives reenacting the lifestyle.  
  
We enjoyed touring all around Ireland in [Blarney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-ireland-blarney-stone-castles-exploring-adventure-motorhome.html "Blarney family vacation"), [Killarney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/family-travel-photo-ireland-st-patricks-day-killarney-ring-of-kerry-traditional-muckross-farms.html "Kilarney family vacation"), [Dingle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/family-travel-photo-ireland-dingle-fusia-red-flower-green-landscape.html "dingle family vacation"), [Rock of Cashel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-ireland-rock-of-cashel-st-pat.html "Rock of Cashel photo") and have so much more  yet to tell. We started in a very dramatic and stressful way due to a [car wreck on route to Ireland](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/car-wreck-in-france-dealing-with-disaster-road-trip-nightmare-car-accident-abroad-insurance-problems.html#more "car wreck on arrival to Ireland in motorhome") from France, but everything eventually worked out  
  
Don't you love those big horses? What are your favorite memories of Ireland? Or is it on your list?

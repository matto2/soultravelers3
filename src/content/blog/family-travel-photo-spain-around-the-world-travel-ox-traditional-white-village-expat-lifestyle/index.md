Doing [around the world family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html), you just never know what you will see or experience next. Today [in Spain,](http://soultravelers3new.local/spain/) I was working on [my book about our travel story](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html), typing away on my macbook,Â  when I looked up and saw this scene. [Oxe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox)n pulling a car is just not your every day scene in America, but very much part of our [exotic lifestyle today.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html)

I love living on the edge of the countryside ( or campo in Spanish) because we constantly hear and see horses and various animals going by with many of the farm folks who still like to do many things the old fashion way. Yes, that is our [motor home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/our-new-camper.html) parked for the winter in the background. We are really going to miss this sweet village as we will start to winter in Asia for a few years so that Mozart can [immerse deeply in her 3rd language, Mandarin Chinese.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html) Do you think we will see some oxen and unusual things there too?

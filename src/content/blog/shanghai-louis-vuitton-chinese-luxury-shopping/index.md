[Shanghai](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/shanghai-skyline-worlds-best-.html "shanghai skyline") is a very impressive city, but some how we didn't expect all the western style luxury and shopping like this Louis Vuitton store. We should have known because [Shanghai](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/shanghai-with-kids.html "shanghai with kids") has long been a haven of international shopping and [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "China travel") is the world’s largest luxury market. Yet, it is not the typical image for [most of China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/life-in-china.html "life in china").  
  
We aren't into [consumerism](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "consumerism ") and actually more comfortable [bargaining at the markets in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/panjiayuan-antique-market-beijing-best-gifts.html "bargaining in china market panjiayuan") or shopping the [famous Muslim street in Xi'an](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-travel-shopping-and-markets-rtw.html "shopping muslim street Xi'an china silk road"), but it is fascinating to see. We certainly enjoy luxury and loved our time at [Fairmont's Peace Hotel.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/fairmont-peace-hotel-shanghai-luxury-legend-review.html "fairmont peace hotel")..a luxury legend.  
  
About an hour away from Shanghai, the small [water village](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/visiting-a-beautiful-water-village-china-zhujiajio.html "water village china") is a whole different world.  
  
Louis Vuitton has been selling in [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-travel-peking-opera.html "China travel") for over twenty years as are many other luxury brands like Gucci , Armani, Dior, Cartier, Prada, Tiffany, BMW etc.. By 2015, the experts predict China’s luxury market would account for [one-fifth of global sales.](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/business/mainland-chinese-travelers-luxury-brands)  
  
“Chinese have become, and will remain for a long time, the most important luxury consumers.” Bruno Lannes of Bain & Company ( The Economist)

How many cities with the population of 800,000 people do you know that have cows wondering about on little patches of land or empty lots in a booming urban area? Some how, only in [weird Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/weird-asia.html "weird strange Asia") do you find unlikely contrasts like this pastoral scene smack in the middle of massive urban glut. So [typical Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "typical Asia").  
  
Remember that large 8 story mall I wrote about last [Christmas in Asia,](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/12/tropical-christmas-abroad-in-asia.html "Christmas in Asia")  plus more photos of it on our [Apartment Living in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "finding an apartment in Penang"), [Singing Karaoke](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/singing-karaoke-in-asia.html "singing karaoke") or during the [Lamborghini](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/yellow-lamborghini.html "lamborghini") car show posts?  
  
Right next to this huge mall and all the nearby high rise [luxury apartments](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/penang-apartment-or-condo-rental-plenty-of-choices.html "luxury apartments in Penang") with the endless ridiculous traffic zipping by, is this little oasis for sacred cows.  I am not sure if these are official "holy cows" or not, ( those that are used for the Hindu temples or to pull ox carts during Indian festivals in [Little India](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/little-india-in-georgetown-penang.html "little india")) as no one was around to ask.  
  
I see goats and cows regularly out my own [high rise window](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "high rise window view penang") and they always amaze me a little as it seems so odd to see them in this very urban setting in a lot next to the mall two blocks from me or dodging construction rubble. Granted we did see some unusual sites like this [traditional oxcart in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-photo-spain-around-the-world-travel-ox-traditional-white-village-expat-lifestyle.html "traditional oxcart in Spain"), but that at least was a rural setting.  
  
Where is the oddest place that you have seen sacred cows?

**RETIRE EARLY AND TRAVEL THE WORLD**  
  
We were a bit nervous to retire at barely 50, but now we are so glad that [we sold everything](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "OUR NOMADIC TRAVEL  LIFESTYLE") to do this and took the risk.

**  
CAN YOU AFFORD TO TRAVEL IN RETIREMENT?**  
  
We don't have unlimited funds and very few people have that, but with careful planning and some calculated risk, this is a very doable goal for many baby boomers who want to explore the world. Most people wish that they could leave their everyday work routine behind and depart on a world tour that never ends. You can!  
  
![early retirement travel means seeing exciting places like China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330191043c4b26970c.jpg)  
  
**EXTENDED TRAVEL IS CHEAP**  
  
As I wrote long ago, [extended travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "EXTENDED TRAVEL - HOW TO DO IT") is MUCH easier than most people realize and can be done on a very small budget. We've [traveled the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "around the world family travel")Â  and lived large on $23/day per person ( 45 countries on 5 continents) and could do it on even less. That turns out to be 25K a year which is actually pretty typical retirement annual budget.

**STRETCHING RETIREMENT DOLLARS**  
  
We can just stretch our dollars more through [world travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/-around-the-world-travel-best-advice.html "around the world travel best advice") and by [not owning a home](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "selling a home to travel") or many things. A purposefully "homeless" retirement opens many options and you won't really be homeless, but more like you have [many homes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "many homes and travel with kids") like the very rich.  
  
Due to the world wide real estate boom where many bought second homes and then recession, there are a glut of furnished homes and apartments world wide, so most can be rented very easily and cheaply for long term ( especially off season).

**KEYS TO FRUGAL LIVING IN RETIREMENT TRAVEL**  
  
Even places like [Bora Bora](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bora bora on a cheap budget"), [Tahiti](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/the-ultimate-tahiti-vacation-on-a-backpacker-low-budget.html "tahiti travel tips") can be cheap if you live like a local and rent an apartment. We spend time in expensive places like [Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/06/best-tips-camping-paris.html "camping paris tips"), [Norway](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/02/family-travel-photo-norway-in-a-nutshell-fijords-europe-roadtrip-budget-cheap-flam-train-vacation-.html "norway travel"), [Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/05/bhutan-travel.html "bhutan travel"), [Moorea](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/moorea-cheap-and-amazing.html "moorea travel"), [Sydney](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/visiting-the-sydney-opera-house-must-see-australia-travel.html "sydney opera house") etc, but the key to frugal living is living a [minimalist life](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist life") ( which is a maximalist life in ways like freedom), living like a local, not doing a lot of flying and spending the bulk of your time in more rural and cheaper locations.

**RV'S ARE PERFECT FOR RETIREES - ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE**  
  
We also think a [small motorhome](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "traveling around europe in a campervan") is the best way to [vacation in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "vacation in europe"), and is an ideal way to keep a vehicle/home/storage unit in Europe for many [road trips](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "road trip europe") and [grand tours](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "grand tour europe") of the continent over many years. We store it very cheaply when we are not there.  
  
[Camping is luxurious in Europ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "campigng europe")e and these are some of our favorite sites, but you can also do it for free in many countries. Bring your kids or grandkids with free summer camps and [free kids clubs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "free kids clubs europe") or even [learn a language](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning spanish in spain") while there.

**YES YOU CAN RETIRE EARLY AND TRAVEL**  
  
What is sad is most people don't realize that [one doesn't need millions to live this life](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/do-you-have-to-be-rich-like-suri-cruise-to-world-school-learn-mandarin-.html "you don't need to be rich to live like it") and if you are a curious and flexible type, it is so much easier and more rewarding than you can imagine. We travel the world quite luxuriously on much less than we could ever live at home in California.  
  
Do you plan to retire and travel? What is your retirement dream? Are you planning for early retiremnt?

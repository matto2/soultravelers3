Walking barefoot on a beautiful, deserted beach on a gorgeous sunny, winter's day on the [Costa del Sol](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "costa del sol tips"), is one of the many pleasures of [wintering in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "wintering in spain"). With over 300 days of sun a year, [southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "southern spain holiday") is a popular escape for [European holiday makers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best european vacations"), since it is one of the few warm spots in Europe. It's off season though, so easy to [avoid any crowd](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html "avoid crowds when traveling")s.  
  
What is [winter in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html "winter in spain apartments") like? If you are far to the south and on the beach in [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/andalusia-pleasures.html "andalusia vacation pleasures"), it is usually quite warm and we've worn just [t-shirts even on Christmas day](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/01/white-xmas-sort.html "t-shirts on Christmas - warm and sunny in spain") in our [beautiful white village](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html "beautiful white village spain").  It can get chilly at night, but it's a very pleasant Mediterranean weather, and one can also ski in the nearby mountains in [Granada](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/la-alhambra.html "Granada").  
  
This winter on our [open ended](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "open-ended extended travel how-to") [world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "multi-year world tour as a family"),  we will be doing a [tropical winter in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical winter in Asia penang") as kidlet immerses in her [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "learning mandarin in Asia"), ( with a month in China soon too) but we will always have fond memories of our four [winters in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "travel christmas in Spain") and shall return again.  
  
Is vacationing or wintering in Spain on your list?

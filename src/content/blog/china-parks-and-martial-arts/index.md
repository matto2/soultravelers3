Can we learn about  
travel fitness and travel  
health from the Chinese?

Can we learn about [travel fitness](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/exercise-and-travel-how-to-stay-in-shape-while-traveling.html "travel fitness") and [travel health](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health") from the Chinese?  
  
The parks in [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "beijing") are filled with people exercising and playing amongst the autumn leaves on these cool, crisp sunny days, but there is plenty of open space, so it was never crowded. We enjoyed the time in nature as well as watching the Tai Chi and Qigong, especially when they were dressed in traditional clothing like this lady in the photo.  
  
Since my good friend [Winser is a Tai Chi master](http://www.chinatravel20.com/2012/05/21/winser-zhaothe-taiji-quan-master-in-beijing/ "winser Zhao tai chi master "), we will definitely learn some while here in China and will join in with the locals. I've been using a La-jin bench at the health based Chinese school that we've being hosted by and I am finding it quite amazing for self-healing.  
  
There is singing, chess playing and more in the parks, but the favorite game for Mozart was the Jianzi. It is a traditional Asian game,Â  kind of like Hacky Sack, using a shuttlecock with your feet and passing it around in a circle without using hands. We bought one with bright pink feathers and she has been playing with it ever since.  
  
Have you ever tried Tai Chi or Qigong? Have you watched them do it in China?

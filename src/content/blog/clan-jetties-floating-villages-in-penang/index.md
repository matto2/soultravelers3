Have you seen the floating village of ancient homes on stilts in the [UNESCO Heritage Site city of Georgetown](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Georgetown, Penang UNESCO"), Penang?  
  
This photo was taken at the Chew Jetty which is part of the historical Clan jetties in Weld Quay. The [Clan Jetties](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/exploring-colorful-asia.html "Clan Jetties Penang") along the waterfront are traditional fishing settlements created by Chinese immigrants who share common lineage and geographic origin. This is a popular [Georgetown attraction](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/family-travel-asia-photo-georgetown-malaysia.html "Georgetown, Penang attraction") and part of [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang at night") Heritage Trail that shows historical [life in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "life in Asia").  
  
These were created in the 19th century and sadly many have been demolished, but eight clan jetties remain today and the Chew Jetty is the best preserved and largest. All the people here are named Chew and are descendants from Xin Lin She village in Fujian Province in China.  
  
This photograph shows the fishing boats docked and the sidewalks made of wooden planks and as you walk around you meet friendly folks who still live a traditional community lifestyle with clan-related activities.  
  
Interestingly, the street art you see on the building, is done by the same artist that painted the [fun kids on bikes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/adorable-photo-kids-and-bike.html "fun kids on bikes art") installation. I just found this out andÂ  his name is Ernest Zacharevic and he is a 25 year old Lithuania.

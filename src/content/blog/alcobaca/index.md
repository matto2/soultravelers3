The largest Cathedral in Portugal is in Alcobaca, so we made the journey to see it and had a delightful backpack lunch in the orange-tree filled cloister. This town is very close to Nazare and I liked it so much better as it was more authentic and peaceful. [The monastery](http://www.manorhouses.com/unesco/whalco.html) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You can read more about this famous cathedral and monastery [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoba%C3%A7a_Monastery) and [here.](http://www.sacred-destinations.com/portugal/alcobaca-mosteiro-santa-maria.htm)  The true Romeo and Juliet sad story and the amazing kitchen where the monks worked made it quite interesting. There was a preschool on the way and the kids looked so cute in their bright multi-colored smocks.

We stayed at [this campsite](http://www.campings.com/camping-vale-paraiso-nazare/?idlengua=3) where one can visit both Nazare and Alcobaca. One can also easily visit [Fatima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A1tima,_Portugal), Portugal from here, which we intended to do, but had to keep moving northward due to time constraints, so had to choose just  two cities.  Mozart really loved playing with all the pine cones at this campsite, although her father was not fond of the sap. She had quite a collection going which is great fun for a seven year old. She also had fun at the Monastery climbing the orange trees a little  and collecting a few oranges to eat. We loved the kitchen and Mozart had fun trying things out and pretending she was a monk writing important  papers and cooking for the others. The sink, oven and benches they used were huge.There was no one around, so it was a sweet family travel moment. A little history and fun family time into the mix.

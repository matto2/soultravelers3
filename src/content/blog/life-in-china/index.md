What is life like in [China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "travel to China tips")? Like most places, that is a question with as many answers as there are people. On our [trip to China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/babies-in-beijing-china-travel-joy.html "trip to China"), we are getting a wonderful insider look at [life in China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-parks-and-martial-arts.html "life in China") and the [Beijing lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "beijing lifestyle"), thanks to local friends, [immersing in Mandarin at a local school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "immersing in Mandarin in a local tradional Chinese school"), and living with a local family.  
  
There are so many different aspects and styles of life in China, I am endlessly curious now and want to know more. I've been reading about China quite thoroughly ever since I decided to [raise my child as a trilingual from birth](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "how to raise a bilingual or trilingual kid") with [Mandarin being one of her languages](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "why learn mandarin in Asia"), but now I want to read even more.  
  
Much of China in the cities is ultra modern, luxurious and exciting. We're exploring Shanghai and the nearby ancient water villages now and of course Forbidden City, Tiananmin Square, the Great Wall, hutong life and Temple of Heaven are must-sees in Beijing, next week we will explore Xian. We will see and experience a ton this month for a first trip to China, but still so much more to explore in this huge country.  
  
Every day life is very different than America or Europe on the ground level. The bikes, the heavy traffic, the street food, the super crowded subway and many other things leaves no doubt that one is in Asia. But it is also a very different life than South East Asia or Bhutan.  
  
Part of the fun in a new country is just observing the every day life and seeing what is different and what is the same from home or other places one has visited. Just a man walking down a street is a good photo opportunity as it gives us a glimpse into a new world.

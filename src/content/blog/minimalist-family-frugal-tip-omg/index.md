Tip - OMG!  
  
Many are curious about our minimalist  
family ways and how we live so  
frugally as we travel the world

Many are curious about our [minimalist family ways](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family") and how we live cheaply and do super [frugal travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html "frugal travel ") as we have [traveled the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "travel the world") non-stop these last 7-plus years on only $23/day per person.  
  
We took the calculated risk to [retire early](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retire early and travel") in 2005, so we could [world school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school education ") our child and have [more freedom](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/advice-to-college-grads-from-a-world-traveler.html "advice to college graduates") and [fun](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "family travel fun") together, thus we became experts on [traveling cheap](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "traveling cheap bora bora") even in expensive countries and [eating healthy and cheap in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "eating healthy and cheap in Europe") and [everywhere](http://soultravelers3new.local/food_and_drink/ "food and drink around the world"). We don't believe in debt and always live under our means.

We've written before about our [best advice for RTW travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/-around-the-world-travel-best-advice.html "best advice for RTW travel"), [best packing tip for world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/best-packing-tip-for-world-travel.html "best packing tip"), [best tips for family travel](ww.soultravelers3.com/2010/02/15-best-tips-for-family-friendly-travel-airplanes-airports-vacation-roadtrips-long-term-family-trave.html "best tips for family travel"), [slow travel benefits](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel benefits") and much more, but some tips like this one, are practical, but also amusing.  
  
We recently moved our base to a new location in [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang travel tips"), so we got a chance to purge ( which we do with every move and trip) and we FINALLY threw out my 12 year old [fashionista](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "fashionista world traveler") daughter's favorite shorts. What is OMG funny about my 25 kilo/55 lb. [model](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/how-my-almost-teen-became-a-model-.html "teen model")?  
  
These GAP shorts are size 12 months, so she has been wearing them for 12 YEARS! You can see her wearing them in [Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-italy-verona-farm-stay-agritourismo-romeo-juliet-arena-opera.html "Italy vacation verona") in 2008, in [ancient Pergamum](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/ancient-pergamu.html#more "ancient pergamum - Turkey travel") in Turkey in 2007, more [Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/italy-dont-miss-romantic-verona-and-the-opera-.html "italy travel - verona opera") and through out the blog.  
  
She is [healthy](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "health and travel") as a horse, but inherited the skinny genes, so only seems to grow up and not out, thus wears her clothes for a long time, but sometimes it makes us giggle at the absurdity. Thankfully, she is also very neat by nature, so that helps too as well as never using a dryer. The top is also a baby gift that [Grandma](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "traveling with grandma") bought long before we left.

**BEST TIP FOR FRUGAL FAMILIES AND MINIMALISTS?**  
  
DON"T SPEND! Buy few things, but buy quality that you love ( I got these at an extreme off-season sale when she was a baby) and then keep them until they wear out or are outgrown. Some of our favorite things on this trip, we had for years before leaving and are still happily using them!  
  
If you want freedom, avoid [over consumerism](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "over consumerism") and teach that value to your children, as happiness does not come from things! We save a small fortune with our minimalist frugal wardrobes and less stuff makes [travel and life easier](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/how-to-prevent-travel-burnout.html%20 "easy RTW travel - avoid burn out").

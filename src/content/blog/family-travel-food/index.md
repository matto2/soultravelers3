[Family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is sometimes all about the food and being a "foodie"! [Eating food while traveling](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html) whether it is [street food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/kids-view-of-fl.html),[fresh produce](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/family-travel-italy-verona-farm-stay-agritourismo-romeo-juliet-arena-opera.html) , [special meals](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html) or cooking your own from [food shopping](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/food-shopping-san-sebastian-spain-unusual-markets-europe.html) at [local grocery stores](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/04/food-myths-real.html) or [food markets](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/08/family-travel-photo-norway-bergen-fish-market-fresh-salmon.html), can be fun, yummy and educational. We do enjoy tasting local food like we did in [Galicia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/10/post.html), [Prague](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/11/stand-out-meals.html), [Burgundy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/10/nothing-but-pin.html), [Cappadoica](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/07/cappadocia-cave.html) to name just a few places we had great meals. We have also found many [ways to eat healthy and cheaply while traveling Europe.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html)  
  
We love to buy fresh fruit along the road at fruit stands from time to time. When I took this photo cherries were in season in [Barcelona, Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html), so we had been enjoying lots of really delicious cherries. What are your favorite family travel foods on the road?

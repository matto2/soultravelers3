Stockholm is one of the most beautiful cities in the world in my opinion. I first visited it in 1988 when I was returning from a life changing spiritual tour of the [former Soviet Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) with a [peace group.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuMJPvPKBpk&feature=channel_page) I don't think there is any place prettier than Sweden in the summer and I totally fell in love with [Stockholm,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm) so wanted to make sure that I shared this great city with Mozart and DaVinci. We had a ball there last summer and those happy memories will stay with us forever!

Ingredients  
  
**\*** 1/4 cup cold-pressed organic coconut oil, melted  
  
**\*** 1/4 cup organic cacao powder  
  
**\*** 2 - 3 tablespoon raw honey ( or maple syrup)  
  
**\*** 1/4 - 1 teaspoon organic Vanilla extract  
  
**\*** A pinch of Himalayan or Celtic Sea salt to taste

Optional ( if you want to make more of a fudge)  
  
\* 1/2 cup melted grass-fed butter  
\* 1 cup coconut flour  
  
For some reason the butter makes it more fudge like and the coconut oil makes it more candy bar like.

_Instructions:  
  
_In a small bowl, whisk all ingredients well. Make sure there are no lumps. ( add coconut flour to taste if you want it thicker)  
  
Press mixture evenly onto a piece of parchment paper  
  
Put it in the freezer for a few minutes to allow the coconut oil to harden or "bake" and voilà it is done and melt-in-your-mouth delicious!

I tend to cut the squares both before and after, plus always adlib a bit on this recipe every time as it is pretty fool proof.

You could use chocolate bar molds if you want, but I haven't bothered yet. I store them in the refrigerator but they go quickly in our family! Even Mozart makes these on her own when she is in the mood for something healthy, raw and sweet!

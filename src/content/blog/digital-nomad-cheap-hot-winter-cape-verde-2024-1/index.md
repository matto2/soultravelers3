Then perhaps Cabo Verde, a low budget yachting, hiking & wind surfing haven, is for you! Called ‘Europe’s Caribbean’ by _The Telegraph,_ Cape Verde is unique_._ I've written about the,  [best warm winter destinations](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/11/best-warm-winter-digital-nomad-destinations-.html) & [sunny winter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/12/top-8-warmest-winter-places-in-or-near-europe-for-digital-nomads-travel.html#more) tips if you are [in Europe.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/09/diy-luxury-glamping-near-barcelona-.html) As pioneer [digital nomads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/09/vacation-vs-full-time-travel-digital-nomad-lifestyle.html), [van lifers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/06/tiny-house-on-wheels-vintage-rv-remodel-.html#more)  and [worldschoolers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html), we always [skip the cold,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/winter-camping-in-europe.html) unless it is just a quick stop to [ski for a weekend](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/skiing-in-southern-spain.html).  
  
Surprisingly, Cabo Verde is a little known travel destination with no mass tourism so mostly unspoiled and authentic. Plus 9 hours of sunshine per day, stunning landscapes, and average temps of 75-85 degrees year round, makes it an ideal winter getaway.

We really enjoyed this New Years Eve, with 70's F ( 20's C)  temps in Portimao, Portugal & our all  day beach hike on one of Europe's most beautiful  beaches - Praia Da Rocha. But the Algarve did have some colder, rainy days and [Lisbon](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/portuguese-day.html) & [Sintra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/07/scintillating-s.html) had very cold mornings in the forties!  
  
Day temperatures are in the low 80's since we arrived in Cabo Verde! Many are swimming in the sea in January! That is my idea of winter as I hate cold. I grew up in Michigan and lived in NYC, Pa and Boston when young, so no more cold winters for me.

We have just arrived in Praia, the largest city in  Cabo Verde, so will be writing more about our experiences. It is the capitol, has 160,000 residents and is located on the southern coast of Santiago Island. Cape Verde is a safe destination, with generally low crime rates.The motto of Cape Verde is "No Stress". [Morna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwmVmOa_-qw) is  the most popular genre of Cape Verdean music and [Cesaria Evora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SVER-bHVgU) became a grammy-winning international superstar singing it.

Praia is tropical but arid (no winter rain) and seldom gets too hot or too cold, due to its seaside location. Temperatures are always warm, often breezy with an average high temperature of 27 °C (81 °F) and an average low temperature of 22 °C (72 °F). Santiago island has many swimming beaches; a diverse landscape; excellent music and nightlife, hiking, shopping and dining. Unesco history and culture is in the old capital Cidade Velha, the first European colonial town to be built in the tropics.

Lonely Planet claimed that " _Beaches and islands of Cape Verde in top-10 best of the world"._ But the islands of Sal and Boavista are more oriented towards tourists and have wonderful white beaches and bright blue sea.

Cabo Verde is an archipelago of 10 diverse islands off the western most point of continental Africa, 311 miles (500km) west of Senegal. It is part of the Macaronesia region along with the Azores, Canary Islands & Madeira. We took a 4 hour budget flight on TAP Air Portugal from Lisbon. It’s a 6 hour flight from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, and 7½ hours from east coast USA. For Europeans, it is the closest flight to tropical winter weather!

Now we are  in a comfortable, low budget, fully equipped studio apartment with a terrace, air conditioning, washing machine, TV, internet and more. It is a close walk to grocery stores, restaurants, beaches etc. The owner is very helpful and lives next door with his wife. We will be here until April. We may do some island hopping and day trips. There are some interesting museums and Unesco site nearby.

Our kind, very helpful host was born in Cabo Verde, but went to school in the USA and owns businesses there and here. We have not needed the air conditioning. The apartment is clean, cute, very comfortable and well maintained with a sweet energy.

Next door to this apartment is the best bakery in all of Cabo Verde! The fresh bread baking smells waft up to us and are intoxicating. [My father](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/what-i-learned-from-my-father.html) was a baker, so it brings back happy memories of visiting the bread factories he managed.

Sadly, due to our [longevity, healthy eating](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/06/my-weight-journey-down-135lbs-612-kilos.html) protocol and my [weight loss journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/03/how-i-lost-170lbs77-kilos-at-70.html#more), we [do not eat](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/03/health-benefits-of-sun-barefoot-beach-walk.html) many carbs! But of course, we had to at least try a bit on our first day. The chocolate cake was divine, but the cheese cake was the best either one of us has ever tasted in our lives!

Like our [digital nomad, long stay](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/09/vacation-vs-full-time-travel-digital-nomad-lifestyle.html#more) experiences in [Bulgaria](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/08/-europes-cheapest-digital-nomad-haven-bansko.html#more), [Albania](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/11/meeting-a-rock-star-jazz-musician-traveling-.html) and [Cyprus](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/02/larnaca-travel-tips-.html), we are off the beaten path & learning as we go. Sometimes it does feel like we are on another planet, but that is part of the fun too.

“But that's the glory of foreign travel, as far as I am concerned. I don't want to know what people are talking about. I can't think of anything that excites a greater sense of childlike wonder than to be in a country where you are ignorant of almost everything. Suddenly you are five years old again. You can't read anything, you have only the most rudimentary sense of how things work, you can't even reliably cross a street without endangering your life. Your whole existence becomes a series of interesting guesses.” - Bill Bryson**

We are not in a tourist focused place as we are not tourists. We decided to base in Praia because it is the biggest city on the biggest island in Cape Verde. We almost never need a doctor or hospital, but at our age, glad to be close to the best in CV if needed . One of the hardest things about Carpe Verde is gathering information before coming. The person who helped us the most was [Angelo](https://www.expat.com/forum/profile.php?id=269596)  ( who moved here from Boston and has a consulting business specializing in Expat Relocation and Investment ). He is an American ( who is originally from the Caribbean) who has lived here 16 years. He is really a super helpful and friendly person.  We will be writing more about our experiences here to help others. What would you like to know?

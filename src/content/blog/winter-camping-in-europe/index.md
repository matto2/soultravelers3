Can you [camp in Europe in the winter](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/camping-spain.html "camp in europe in winter") time? Absolutely! Just as there are "snowbirds" who head south to winter in the USA, one finds the same thing in [Europe.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best Europe vacations") LOTS of bargains about as well for long term campers who settle in when there are no crowds.  
  
Of course, there are places where you can camp and [snow ski in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/12/skiing-in-southern-spain.html "skiing in Europe") and many colder area campsites are open all year round like [Paris](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/09/paris-bois-de-b.html "paris camping") or [London](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/camping-in-london-best-low-budget-travel.html "london camping"), but most folks who want to spend the winter camping Europe, head [south to Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/winter-beach-beauty-of-southern-spain.html "southern spain in winter") on the [Costa del Sol](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "costa del sol best tips") or [Portugal Algarve](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/06/arriving-in-alg.html "visit portugal algarve") as these are the warmest areas of Europe in the winter.  
  
If you are hardy, you could also camp in [Barcelona](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "barcelona camping") or [Southern France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/around-the-world-with-kids-extended-travel-long-term-travel-families-and-friends.html "camping southern France") as some do, but just be prepared for it to be a little colder and usually more rain ( maybe snow)  in the the winter. In my opinion, one is better off in the deep coatal south during the coldest months of December, January and February.

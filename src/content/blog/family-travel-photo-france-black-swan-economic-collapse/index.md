Have you read the popular economic book Black Swan? It is not about family travel, but  DaVinci is reading it now, (thanks to our friends back in our [little Spanish village](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html) who loaned it to him). Thus, I just had to use this photo of a black swan that [I took in France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/family-travel-photofrance-puy-du-fou-theme-park-1.html) at the wonderful [Puy du Fou](http://www.puydufou.com/uk/) in honor of [that book](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/). I love [swans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan) of all kinds, so this is as good an excuse as any to include this, don't you think? Also economics certainly played a big part [in our timing of this trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/timing-is-eve-1.html) and it is a book and author that we admire.

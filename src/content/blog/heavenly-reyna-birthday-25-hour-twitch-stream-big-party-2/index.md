We just bought a [beach house in beautiful Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2025/05/best-tips-americans-buying-home-in-spain.html#more), but are here in California waiting for our Spain retirement visa and purging things. It has been a blast seeing photos that we have not seen for years & can share now some adorable photos that you have never seen of Heavenly's earliest days. This blog is not only to help others but also a bit of personal history references for Heavenly to have for generations long after we are gone. This post is a gift for Heavenly with little bits of her story & beginnings that affect her forever & I will not always be around to tell some of these details. So I wanted to share them now on this big birthday! Heavenly is so lucky to have [celebrated birthdays around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html), but we have not documented much here of her first 5 years in California.

![Heavenly reyna birth](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026948a9200d-500wi-1.jpg)This is the very first photo of Heavenly taken a few seconds after her birth!! She was already smiling at her mom!! We had wanted a water birth, but had a very long, painful labor that ended in a c-section. This is a photo of a photo so not the clearest here, but too precious not to share! ![Heavenly reyna home in mom's belly ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f262b6200b-500wi-1.jpg)

This is Heavenly a few days before her birth at our home & boutique vineyard in Santa Cruz mountains near Silicon Valley! I had just gotten a natural henna tattoo to celebrate on my belly - a big heart & her name above it. Besides the Pinot small vineyard we put in, we always had tons of sunflowers near our large organic gardens and herb garden. No wonder Heavenly's favorite flower is a sunflower!

![Heavenly reyna in belly with godmother](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbaa27200c-500wi-1.jpg)We had a long wait for Heavenly, so it was a very joyous time. I am grateful for the sweet family and friends that created the special Blessing Way for us right before her birth. This is a photo of her Godmother ( who interestingly also traveled around the world when she was 5 as her father was in government in the fifties).

![Gar & I preg bellies ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2636e200b-500wi-1.jpg)  
I love this photo of us that day in front of our fountain and herb garden. Gar made a joke about wanting to show his pregnant belly too and we all cracked up!

![Pregnant with heavenly in our pinot vineyard](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2637f200b-500wi-1.jpg)

We had not planned on creating a new vineyard and a new baby at the same time ( as both are time intensive). Our home had nothing but scraped earth and no plants when we bought it. No hardscape, landscape, pergola, well-house, fountains, fencing, gate, olive trees, flowers, cypress trees, gardens, painted outside etc. We had been creating the home we had visualized step by step with the potential we saw when we first bought it unfinished. We did not know we would sell this home to travel the world & I was even already visualizing Heavenly some day having her wedding here. We thought it was our forever home, but life leads one where we need to go. Heavenly was lucky to grow up on a few acre organic farm & boutique vineyard in the Santa Cruz mountains where she could roam freely and with distant sea views. It happened to be near one of the oldest vineyards in California ( from the 1860's) & once owned by the Smothers Brothers.

![Happy pregnancy with Heavenly](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbb552200c-500wi-1.jpg)

I had a perfect, super healthy, easy pregnancy and we so enjoyed those nine months ( despite being an older mom). It was a very blissful time! I never ate so perfectly and meditated so devotedly as I believe that everything that goes into the mother, goes to and affects the growing fetus baby. We had been planning this for a long time and we were more than ready to begin this new journey. We didn't know we would be in our second home when she came, as we actually originally thought and visualized that Heavenly would be born in our first country home in the redwoods!

![Hot tub deck in redwood fairy circle ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbdf03200c.jpg)  
We built a large, private outdoor room and deck in a redwood fairy ring.(We got married in this redwood fairy circle which had an ancient outdoor hearth that said "this hearth is home"). We did enjoy the unique space and had many retreats, events and art shows here instead. My nieces enjoyed it on their yearly summer visits and we loved our time here.

![Soultravelers3 Craftsman home in the redwoods](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f299f3200b.jpg)

This was our first home which was built in the early 1900's by a well known pioneer & teacher in the Craftsman style. It was a magical place surrounded by redwoods, hiking trails,  a 35 foot high swing over the little creek below, 2 decks, another small cottage and the fairy ring deck we built, plus flowers galore. Life just ended up taking us in a new direction, somewhat influenced by a trip we took to Europe and also wanting to create a vineyard and other gardening dreams needing more sun.

![Heavenly Reyna birthday princess 4 years old](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026980b6200d.jpg)But let's get back to the birthday princess and a bit about her arrival, first years & fun birthday celebrations. Things we remember well, but she was too young to remember all these fun details and moments that create who she is now.  
![ Heavenly Reyna happy baby early photo shoot](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402698570200d.jpg)

Just like me, Heavenly was born with a big head of black hair and blue eyes. But just like mine, it turned blond later and her eyes turned green later as well. The above photo was a fun early photo shoot.

After Heavenly arrived, we were all glad to be home after a few days in the hospital to recover! She was born about an hour and a half north of our home as the best birthing center for natural water births was there. The birth was something like 48 hours of hard back labor with no medication ending in a C-section in a hospital & I was 48 so recovery was needed for both of us. At 36 I ran a full marathon without training which took my body months to recover and this was much harder. Still I was gloriously happy to have my long awaited baby in my arms!

![Heavenly newborn with mom](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbb70d200c-500wi-1.jpg)  
When we arrived home, tons of beautiful balloons were everywhere greeting us ( that my sweet sis put up to surprise & welcome us)!!! We even still have one from storage & it instantly brought back the sweet joy of that moment to be home finally with our baby.

![Heavenly it is a girl balloons are everywhere on our house & gate to greet us!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883303040269581e200d-500wi-1.jpg)  
Soon family visitors arrived to meet the princess! Newborn Heavenly with her maternal grandmother. She only had 3 grandchildren ( many years apart & both living at a great distance).So Heavenly was the first grand daughter who lived nearby and from a daughter. They were very close from the start. My mother is the oldest of 7 and had a joyful & soothing with babies and children.

Her grandfather and aunt from her dad side also came to greet her and kiss her forehead.

![Newborn Heavenly kissed by paternal grandfather](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbb874200c-500wi-1.jpg)  
Not only did we wait for nine years for Heavenly to finally show up (after many years of prayers, grief, loss, miscarriages etc), but she chose to be a 2000 "millennium baby" which was a very exciting & unique time as we all moved into the new 21st century with Y2K drama! I wore some 2000 baby maternity tops & this angelic 2000 first baby outfit seemed perfect for Heavenly! Funny that as a young adult she started collecting sonny angels! (I also happened to collect angels in my twenties). Words on the shirt said things like "A bit of heaven comes to earth" & "rainbows paint your future bright". We just rediscovered this as we still have this outfit that still looks brand new!  
![Angel & wishes for an angel 2000 first outfit for Heavenly ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026959c7200d-500wi-1.jpg)

This picture cracks me up as it must of been one of our early outings with Heavenly asleep in her sling. She was so tiny and I was still figuring out how to use these things as we were into attachment parenting.

![Heavenly and new parents ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2722d200b-500wi-1.jpg)  
We got so many compliments on her birth announcement. These things are fun to create when you have a top designer in the family. I loved this poem and it seemed to fit perfectly.

![Baby Heavenly Reyna birth announcement poem](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402695988200d-500wi-1.jpg)

She was the cutest, most alert and strongest newborn and we were thrilled beyond words. The pediatrician at her birth said she was "a power house" & she lifted her head up on her first day home. We had a NET chiropractor & other healers come to our home at her arrival to help release any birth trauma.

![Baby heavenly announcement](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2b2f6200b.jpg)

She had a hand made adorable small wood cradle and a moses basket, but she did not use either much. She liked sleeping right next to me in bed and that was the easiest.

We would often take photos in the mirror as she liked to look at us and sometimes admire what she was wearing.

![Heavenly Reyna newborn in bundler on mom](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026961c9200d-500wi-1.jpg)  
Life goes on and one learns as you go with a baby like anything else. Thankfully, I had read everything about child rearing for a few decades. In high school, I told my friends that I would "pop out a baby at the last minute" which turned out to be prophetic. I just wanted time for my own career and life and during my teens and twenties, many women had babies very early. Even as a nurse in my twenties, I was asking about the best way to prepare for birth. I didn't expect to wait this long, but the blessing is that it gave me many, many years to study and prepare. We loved the [bundler](https://tuckandbundleshop.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooEMoF7e2GNIjZCrArTx8CfChWWyUJOEquAbFGrov9SOW9g1mvy) baby wrap and even Gar used it on weekends while Heavenly slept on him, I got some rest and he got some work done. In her early months she could not sleep unless she was on someone, so we adapted. She needed to sleep as she was so active and needed sleep to help gain weight Heavenly was a unique baby, so I was so grateful I had prepared. I would not have been able to handle it all when I was in my twenties.

![Heavenly Reyna attachment parenting with dad in pinot vineyard home ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026962b3200d.jpg)

Not a clear photo, but I wanted to document here that Heavenly may have missed the water birth we planned ( although we labored at the sea and in hot tubs) but she was swimming and floating in water in our large jacuzzi tub from day one in our home daily. She loved the water, it calmed her and relieved colic and distress & very quickly was taking baby swimming lessons every week. I use to sing "Summer Time" to her & we even nursed in the tub so very relaxing. She soon became a great swimmer and swim lessons  were  something we could do together as a family before Gar had to go to work. She even had the tiniest "O'Neils" wet suit you have ever seen! Once a week we would go to work with him early ( about an hour away in silicon valley) and do swim lessons & Gymboree class before he went to work, and then Heavenly and I spent our day at book stores, parks and libraries nearby.

We started a trend while we waited for her by carving a pumpkin with her name in our organic garden.She just yawned at first site but I love this photo!

![Heavenly Reyna newborn with Heavenly carved pumpkin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f27bc3200b-500wi-1.jpg)Horrible quality, but hilarious that GAP had a newborn skeleton costume so we had to enjoy this crazy first!

She is still not impressed with her first Thanksgiving pumpkin, but you will see she starts to love this tradition soon as she is after all a harvest baby!

![Heavenly Reyna first Thanksgiving](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883303040269645b200d-500wi-1.jpg)Heavenly Reyna had a beautiful Baby Blessing in San Francisco at about 2 1/2 months old with a large gathering from our church. She really seemed to love the process and was full of joy & wonder!

![Heavenly Reyna new born baby blessing ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402698422200d.jpg)  
Unlike many babies that age, she seemed to just love it and the crowd of people watching.You can see even as a newborn she was very alert and aware.The crowd also loved her with lots of laughs and applause at her cute reaction. (Many of the people there I had known 20 years and many were aware of how long the struggle was that we had waiting for her to show up and the losses along the way). So it was an extra joyous occasion  and celebration!

![Heavenly Reyna after baby blessing with parents grandmother and John Morton](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402698432200d.jpg)Afterwards, Heavenly's dad lifts her for the audience to see and her God Parents were both there ( as well as my mom and step dad and a few close friends standing up for her).One was a very wise & beautiful soul who was in her 20's and in college. I wanted her as support for Heavenly as we were all older ( in case we checked out early). So sad to say that she was the one who died early. Perhaps she watches over Heavenly ( and her own young son) from Heaven.

Since I waited so long for her to show up, I collected many one-of-a-kind baby clothes for over a decade. We had to laugh when we unpacked them here as I have not seen them for many years, but they still look like new and ready for Heavenly's baby if she ever decides to do that or use them.

![Heavenly Reyna tiny newborn hand made leather shoes ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbe33e200c.jpg)

Heavenly's first Christmas photo with Santa Claus! She looked so much like a doll at that point that I have a picture of her somewhere taken that day at the mall amongst a bunch of life like dolls. It was hard to tell that she was not one of the dolls!

![Heavenly Reyna newborn 1st Santa pic](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f27ceb200b-500wi-1.jpg)

By this early age she has already taken a trip to Yosemite to see snow for the first time! We have relatives in this area, so it was an annual xmas pilgrimage. She took her very first trip and hotel stay at just 2 weeks old, so traveling seems to be in her genes! She always loved new places and new adventures!

![Heavenly Reyna snow Yosemite](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc34e200c-500wi-1.jpg)We had fun making unique xmas cards and I wish I could do more 4 photos at once on this blog post!

![Heavenly Reyna first xmas](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f27d16200b-500wi-1.jpg)

Heavenly was always very advanced for her age which gave us many surprises as she was not following the baby books, but making up her own path. She was crawling at three months and she was fast always!

![Heavenly Reyna early fast crawler 4 months](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc35b200c-500wi-1.jpg)

Right after crawling, she taught herself to do an Asian style squat. ( I wondered what the heck she was doing while learning as I never saw a baby do that before).

![Heavenly Reyna 3 months squatiting Asian style reading book](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbf45a200c.jpg)

But she had her own plan. Then at 5 months she started standing up from the squat without touching anything to help!

![Heavenly Reyna standing at 5 months old on her own!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc435200c-500wi-1.jpg)

And then she started walking! Yep she was walking and talking in 3 languages at 6 months! We were amazed & shocked! Her doctors were amazed as well and had never seen it. I was stunned that none of the top pediatric doctors at Stanford had ever seen it before. One doctor said that she was the smartest baby she had ever seen in 30 years of practice, including her extremely bright 2nd son. Another said she was developmentally twice her age.

![Heavenly Reyna in newborn baby clothes walking at 6 months!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026965e3200d-500wi-1.jpg)  
The best advice I got from one doctor was to treat her like her development age, not her chronological age.We saw a lot of doctors early on because she never  even made it to the 1% level on the weight chart for kids, although she was always normal on height. So of course as new parents we were concerned, but she was just a happy baby in a big hurry. It is hard to put on weight when you are so active.

![Heavenly Reyna book lover 5 months old standing from squat](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f27e45200b-500wi-1.jpg)

She was fearless and bold and on her own track even as a baby. So we just tried to support her, love her and honor her unique path. We each have a unique path and hers was the right one for her, so we just followed her lead.

![Heavenly Reyna baby and daddy ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc50c200c-500wi-1.jpg)It is hard to realize just how tiny she was doing all this.

![Heavenly Reyna garden baby](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883303040269666b200d-500wi-1.jpg)

She was just 10 lbs at 3 months when she was crawling everywhere and upright squatting. ( I guess building her muscles as she was always strong and had exceptional balance).

![Baby Heavevnly Reyna smelling flowers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f27edf200b-500wi-1.jpg)

She just weighed 12 lbs at 6 months when she started walking. Her dad just talked to her in Spanish and I talked to her in English and we exposed her to Mandarin through a friend and tapes. Usually babies either walk or talk early, not both. Also bilingual babies usually talk later than monolingual babies. But again, Heavenly was in a hurry for some reason.

![Heavenly Reyna 6 months walking & talking & many toys](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc544200c-500wi-1.jpg)

She was a busy baby who had lots of toys and a huge playroom as she had taken over our large second living room. She hated the car seat, so I learned to move her to the front seat so she could see me and I filled a large pillowcase with little toys. Then I just gave them to her as we drove to give her something to do and distract her from the car seat hate ( and crying). We lived in the countryside so it was always a long ride to the town for activities.

![Heavenly Reyna adorable joyful baby in a hurry](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc54a200c-500wi-1.jpg)

She would stand anywhere, even on the couch and pick up big things like the phone!  
![Heavenly Reyna 5 months helping daddy with new Pinot vineyard at home](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc563200c-500wi-1.jpg)She enjoyed being out in the garden and vineyard with her dad on weekends. He had taken her first 5 weeks off from work ( which is unheard of then in Silicon Valley, even for moms). But we waited so long and I did not want him to miss the early bonding and baby moon. That time was likely a seed for our world travels later as we saw a difference when he went back to work and just had the weekends with her.  
![Baby Heavenly Reyna beach day with mom](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc577200c-500wi-1.jpg)  
She loved the sea and enjoyed every outing. She was just full of life and joy. They say the days are long but the years are short with a child and that is so true. We are so grateful that she was lucky enough to have 2 stay at home parents and all that time with her dad as most kids do not get this.

![Heavenly Reyna baby 5 months old music together class](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f27f41200b-500wi-1.jpg)

We went to a few music things with Heavenly from the start. One group was for pregnant mothers and babies that I started during early pregnancy. I I was a fan of French doctor and pioneer Dr Odent who introduced water births and advocated for singing during pregnancy ( as they did in ancient times). We also did Music Together and Kindermusik.

![Heavenly Reyna 5 months old standing from squat music together class](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f27f62200b-500wi-1.jpg "Heavenly Reyna 5 months old standing from squat music together class")

When she was 5 months old and stood up at her MusicTogether class, the instructor and everyone was shocked! That is when she got her nickname ["Mozart"! I wrote about this and Heavenly Reyna's music baby path here.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html) As a mother, it was sometimes a challenging time, wondering how best to serve this unique child and I had no one to talk to about it. Partly, I write this in case one day Heavenly has a baby like this. She had other nick names from other mothers like "bionic baby", "genius" ,"miracle baby" etc. All said in good humor, because she was clearly on her own unique track,  but at this point I was beginning to wonder if she was going to end up in college at 6 like some kids. My brother skipped a grade and I know there is always a price to pay for that as well. And he was big for his age and Heavenly was small for her age.

![Heavenly Reyna walking at 6 months gets 1st black eye!!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc5e9200c-500wi-1.jpg)Heavenly was such an early & fast, motivated, fearless walker she managed to give herself a black eye at 6 months old!! She was watched like a hawk & pillows were every where to protect her, but alas she some how managed to bang it. Crushing to us, but it didn't seem to faze her.

![Heavenly Reyna 6 months old helping Daddy with new home vineyard](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f27fa6200b-500wi-1.jpg)

That did not slow her down at all! See her here at 6 months helping her dad with the vineyard work.

![Heavenly Reyna first Easter & basket](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402696754200d-500wi-1.jpg)

You can still see the fading black eye in this Easter basket shot! At least I got her to sit still for this photo!

![Heavenly Reyna baby trips to the zoo & Aquariums](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbd66b200c-500wi-1.jpg)

Since she loved books and already had a ton, we also made lots of early trips to the zoo and Aquariums which she loved. So she could get a better understanding about these animals and things she was reading about.

![Baby Heavenly Reyna at zoo](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026976c0200d-500wi-1.jpg)

My baby book says she weighed 12 lbs at 6 months, so you can imagine how shocked people were when we put this baby down and she started walking & running fast & talking. People actually gasped sometimes & even her doctors at Stanford said they had never seen it before. She had her own unique path from the start and continues to this day.

![Heavenly Reyna baby visting zoo](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026976d6200d-500wi-1.jpg)  
And from the get go, she absolutely loooved performances. I'm the type that follows a child's lead, so I always gave her more of what she loved. Here she is at performance of Nutcracker that she loved and we saw every year. We saw tons of live performances of all kinds because she so loved them.

![Heavenly Reyna loooooved performances like Nutcracker & opera as a baby](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026967da200d-500wi-1.jpg)

At a year she started asking for "Opera" so we eventually took her to see [operas which she adored ( explained here in detail)](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html). We knew nothing about them, but started to learn through her. She even liked watching Met Opera videos over kids videos. She also loved meeting the performers afterwards like this photo of her with Hansel & Gretel after an opera performance.

![Baby Heavenly Reyna opera fan with Hansel & gretal after performance!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbc719200c-500wi-1.jpg)

You can see the joy and excitement in this photo of her before a performance.Often the audience was filled with people older than me, so they were not too happy to see this bubbling, active baby. As soon as it started though, she was still and mesmerized. Afterwards I got lots of compliments on how good she was and they were surprised.Who would have guessed it, but that was life with Heavenly taking us on a unique journey following her lead.

![](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402697079200d-500wi-1.jpg)

Heavenly also loved to stay home and imaginative play. She was such a busy kid that she not only took over our largest living room as her playroom filled with toys and books, but also a large outdoor fenced in patio for water play and outdoor meals with her dolls. If I asked what a new dolls name was, she would come up immediately with a spectacular unique name. When we sold all her toys when we sold this home to travel the world, the buyers thought we had 10 kids! We are minimalist, but she was not & we could not help but spoil her.  
![Heavenly Reyna outdoor playroom patio lunch with toy babies ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f28993200b-500wi-1.jpg)Heavenly has always attracted many gifts! Here she is with Grandma on her first birthday party extravaganza surrounded by just a few of the gifts that filled this very large dining table.

![Heavenly Reyna first birthday party with grandma & presents](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbd43e200c-500wi-1.jpg) Princess Heavenly taking a pony ride on her first birthday! I thought at the time that I just had to do one big party to celebrate her first year, but turned out every birthday with Heavenly meant a big & unique celebration!  
![Princess baby Heavenly Reyna riding pony in her vineyard home at first BD party](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f28dfa200b-500wi-1.jpg)

Heavenly liked her first birthday cake!

![Heavenly Reyna and mom with first birthday cake 2](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbd475200c-500wi-1.jpg)

But did not know quite what to make of her first piñata in the sun! Likely she got it more when the older kids bust it open and every was squealing with delight and munching on candy.

![Heavenly Reyna first birthday & first pinata ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbd4b1200c-500wi-1.jpg)When she changed into her 2nd outfit ( 1 year old cowgirl) and watched the other kids enjoy the pony, she started to get the joy of this new pony ride stuff.

![Heavenly Reyna dressed as cowgirl on her first birthday pony ride at home ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbd4da200c-500wi-1.jpg)

I think Heavenly enjoyed picking those organic cherry tomatoes in the garden as much as anything. She still loves cherry tomatoes! Love that cute little grasp & she was as good with her finger dexterity as she was running fast.  
![Heavenly Reyna in cowboy 1st birthday outfit picking & eating cherry tomatoes ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f28ecc200b-500wi-1.jpg)  
At a year she was also more excited by the carved pumpkin with her name on it and Halloween!

![Heavenly Reyna baby halloween pumpkin & tiger costume](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbd0cd200c-500wi-1.jpg)  
By 9 months old, Heavenly already ran faster than her mother! I  crushed my knee & broke my femur at 36 (broke 2 bones in lower leg same one skiing at 12) & a  chubby older mom, so I am not the fastest. But truly she was a speedy gazelle who gave everyone a run for their money & would go long distances away in parks & such, so I was glad we had a few gated acres to let her run free as the wind. She just wrote a heart touching beautiful song about this called Faster  
![Heavenly Reyna baby 1 year old running faster than her mother ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbd0fa200c-500wi-1.jpg)

At a year she was beginning to love our carved pumpkin with her name harvest/Halloween/Thanksgiving celebrations

![Heavenly Reyna baby on Thanksgiving](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f28a0d200b-500wi-1.jpg)

Heavenly was and still is mighty & full of joy!

![Heavenly Reyna joy baby at one year old ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883303040269710f200d-500wi-1.jpg)

Do you think I over did it with the berets? Perhaps. She liked them then, but now does not!

![Heavenly Reyna baby full of joy ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbd7b1200c.jpg)

Hat or no hat, she always looked perfect to me!

![Heavenly Reyna in playroom at 1 year old ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883303040269781e200d.jpg)  
She was born with black hair and blue eyes, but as she lost her baby hair, the new hair started coming in blonder, but first a bit reddish as well and we did not know what color her hair would be. Our hairdresser told me she would have wavy hair when I was pregnant. I asked how she knew and she said "because you and your husband both have wave in your hair". So funny and of course she was right.

![Heavenly Reyna first Easter egg hunt ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402699113200d.jpg)  
Easter was always fun! This is her first one at 7 months going to her first Easter Egg hunt at our neighbors house for all the country kids on our road. You might remember early that morning her seeing her first Easter Basket filled with chocolate bunnies! ( I put this on IG one Easter and it always makes me smile).

Every holiday was exciting with a new baby.

![Heavenly Reyna 1 year old xmas at Grandma's house ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f291d6200b.jpg)Heavenly was lucky to grow up her first 5 years in the Santa Cruz mountains. She also lived near the sea and her grandmother lived in an enchanting home on the river ( next to f[amous Shadowbrook](https://www.shadowbrook-capitola.com)) a few feet from the oldest beach in California. So she has always been a beach baby!

![Heaveny Reyna beach baby ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2a827200b.jpg)  
We loved our organic raised bed vegetable gardens and grew most of our own food and herbs. Plus the Pinot vineyard of course, flowers & fruit trees including apple and pair espalier fruit trees ( inspired by European trips).

![Heavenly Reyna's dad working organic gardens and vineyard in santa cruz mountains ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2a8b9200b.jpg)  
As a harvest baby, Heavenly played a lot in the mud in the gardens and planted her first garden when she was about a year old! We even did [homeschool gardening](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/travel-organic-garden-homeschool-green-unschool-nature-unit-study-lessons-from-gardening-travel-.html) as we traveled the world!

Heavenly loved to pick herbs with me to use when we made dinner!

![Heavenly Reyna cooking with mom as a baby after picking herbs in garden ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbec61200c.jpg)She loved the gardens and picking food and eating it.

At 2 I think we got her a little wooden kitchen so she could cook on her own & she love it!

![Heavenly Reyna cooking on play stove at 2 years old!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2aa50200b.jpg)By two Heavenly was starting to get the hang of the Piñata part of her big birthday parties!

![Baby Heavenly learning pinata technique at her 2 birthday party ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402698fb1200d.jpg)

Of course, she also had a cowboy outfit and new red cowboy boots for her pony ride! Note that her playroom ( ie our largest living room she took over) was filling up with beloved books and puzzles. She was a fanatic for and very advanced at puzzles at this age. She had me running all over collecting puzzles for her to do!  
![Heavenly Reyna in cowboy outfit on her 2nd birthday in her playroom](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2aa81200b.jpg)

Since Heavenly started playing violin at 23 months, we invited 10 year old neighbor kids to play classical music for her party and she loved that! All the kids in the area played violin because we were blessed to have an amazing Yale educated Suzuki teacher ( mom of 7 kids whose mother was also a Suzuki teacher).She had never taken a violin student so young, but Heavenly was ready and really loved performing even then! We did not know then that [Heavenly would be playing violin around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html)! We were shocked when ["Where in Heaven is Mozart"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4) our [first video went viral!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4)

![Heavenly's 2nd birthday ten year old neighbor kids from her violin class performing for the party](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2aa9e200b.jpg)

By her 2nd birthday party she has become a great cowgirl and loves the pony part ( as do all the kids).

![Heavenly reyna at 2 riding a pony at her birthday party](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2aadc200b.jpg)Here 2 year old cowgirl Heavenly takes time out to eat some birthday cake! It really does take a village to raise a child. Here you see her Godmother Cynthia helping out. You also see Heavenly is always surrounded by sunflowers on her birthday so makes sense that is her favorite flower!

![Heavenly Reyna eating at 2nd birthday party with Godmother Cynthia ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402699158200d.jpg)

Heavenly has always been a super creative artist! She was lucky to have a father who was and is an artist who graduated from one of the best art schools in the world. So he taught her well and also enjoyed her funny explorations like painting with her toes at 2!

![Heavenly Reyna baby artist talented and discovered also painting with toes!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026991bb200d.jpg)  
Heavenly started violin at 23 months and she loved the performance part more than anything. I think she was just two in this photo and was performing at the local elementary school. ( Many of the kids at this school played violin).  
![Heavenly Reyna performing with violin at 2 years old!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2ac1d200b.jpg)This is a photo of her one Christmas at 2 when she got to participate and perform in the Nutcracker ballet.

She loved performing the violin.

She had so much fun doing the Nutcracker!

Heavenly started piano lessons at 3 and also she has a certificate from Kindermusic for songwriting at 3. It was for older kids, but she really wanted to do it and was ready, so as usual she got the exception.(She also got exception to start gymnastics as a baby & she needed a safe, padded place to move. As a toddler she was approached by both gymnastics  and soccer experts to start those paths, but we declined). I couldn't find any great pictures of her playing piano in our fast purge, but I have this pic from a YT video of her performing on piano at 5 just before we left on world travel trip.

![Heavenly Reyna started piano lessons at 3 here she is performing at 5 before world travel trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2ae4c200b.jpg)Heavenly just had an uncanny deep interest and love of performance and music from early babyhood. I just followed her lead. I really did not expect at this age that she would be a singer songwriter, actress and artist.

She also liked normal things like playing with friends. Here she is with her oldest friend at 2-ish, who she is still friends with today. In fact, they celebrated her birthday together this year. Her mom and dad are old friends of mine and we were pregnant at the same time. So we saw her regularly even when we were traveling. They spent a lot of time together in their teen years when we moved to Santa Monica and were best buddies.

Of course we also took fun trips to Disneyland and SeaWorld. Always a magical experience for young children!

My mom would golf nearby and then come over once or twice a week and they both loved time together! My mom was in her 70's and finally had a grandchild that lived nearby!

![Heavenly Reyna loved Grandma's weekly visits](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402699499200d.jpg)  
Heavenly's other grandmother was anxiously awaiting her arrival but sadly she died before Heavenly was born. Thankfully, her aunt on that side ( her dad's big sis) was like a grandmother to her and her grandfather was also still around and they even [visited us in Spain for his 80th birthday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/marbella.html). This is Heavenly's 3rd birthday and as you can see, as usual she has a ton of presents again and every year! Her dad and I never got this many presents growing up, but Heavenly still attracts gifts like no other.

![Heavenly on her 2nd birthday surrounded by presents and auntie](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330304026994b3200d.jpg)They are still close and it is reassuring for us to have her close by when we are in Spain a continent away!

![Heavenly Reyna opening presents with aunt BJ!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbf343200c.jpg)

Her grandfather also visited often and never missed the birthday parties. Here he is at her 3rd birthday with a painting he did of her when she was a little younger!

Her aunt Julie ( my sister) & husband were also very involved and helpful. Here you can see her dressed as a clown to entertain. You can see my mom and step dad watching as well. Heavenly had no idea that it was her aunt. The parties were extravagant with pool, bouncy house, pony, piñata, food, fancy cake and a crowd of kids.

This one even had a Disney princess! I had not planned it but a few days before her birthday Heavenly wanted to know if Snow White was coming to her party! Of course, then I had to search down a snow white costume and a young girl to play that role!

![Heavenly Reyna loving the surprise of Snow White coming to her Birthday party at 3 ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2b35c200b.jpg)

They were always fun but also a bit of a madhouse with crazy, wild kids energy. I did not know this was part of the mom job as I'm an introvert and not a party animal.

![Heavenly Reyna wild and crazy 2nd birthday party!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302e860f2b165200b.jpg)

Halloween was big those first 5 years and she loved it. Of course she has always had a sweet tooth. They also have a big parade we always did at the nearby Capitola beach by my mom's house we never missed. This year when she was 2, we all dressed up as clowns! Luckily, Heavenly got to do [California style Halloween and parade](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/enchanting-halloween-california-style-1.html) at 11 here on one of our visits to California during our travel years.

Sometimes the carved pumpkins were bigger than her!

![Heavenly Reyna with carved pumpkin at home bigger than her](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c8d3dbf55d200c.jpg)

She started Kindergarten at 3 and soon turned 4 ( that primary school had never done that before), but again she was ready and already reading well as she taught herself to read at 2! Trying to find a good educational fit for her was one of the reasons we [decided to world school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html). She was tiny but already reading Harry Potter at 4! Great schools, but we tried Waldorf, Montessori and a few others. Our local school was one of the best in California and she started a 1st grade/2nd grade combo ( again they had never done that before) at four years old. She was the youngest and tiniest in both classes as most kids start school late in California not early. She was the best reader in the 2nd grade class by far. She was a pro at big birthday celebrations at 4 also!

Pony riding was a breeze at 4!

![Heavenly was an expert pony rider by her 4th birthday](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833030402699bd8200d.png)  
She loved and mastered the birthday piñata! Funny that this one looks like the pink pony club emoji thingy they use on Twitch when she sings that song ( better than the original everyone says).

Before we left we had [one last big birthday party for Heavenly](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/suite-bon-voyag.html) and a sleep over at a hotel. The cake had an Eiffel tower on it and Paris theme to prepare her.

We started celebrating Heavenly's birthday all over the world, starting with [Paris Eiffel Tower birthday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/mozarts-6th-at.html)! She celebrated her 7th [birthday in Salazburg](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/super-7-salzbur.html "birthday in salzburg"), ( and [Dalmation coast](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/dalmatia-coast.html "dalmation coast"))  her [8th birthday in Stockholm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html "8th birthday in stockholm"), her 9th [birthday in London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-england-knight-tapestry-high-tea.html "birthday in london"), her 10th [birthday in Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "birthday in barcelona") ,  her 11th birthday at [Harry Potter's Wizarding World,](http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/ "harry potter's wizarding world") and staying at the amazing [Coco Key Resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/best-water-park-in-orlando-coco-key-resort.html) with waterslides which she loves, her [12th in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/global-travel-tween-ultimate-birthday-party-in-asia.html "teen birthday in Asia"), Malaysia singing karaoke with her [Mandarin speaking](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "WHY LEARN MANDARIN IN ASIA") friends, 1[3th in Sydney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/celebrating-13th-birthday-in-healthy-ways-at-four-seasons-hotel-sydney.html), [14th in Dallas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/08/cute-teen-clothes-shopping-haul.html), [15th in LA & carnegie hall singing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2016/05/15-year-old-mozart-sings-at-carnegie-hall-.html) , [16th at the beach with friends in Santa Monica](http://soultravelers3new.local/2016/10/teen-mozart-stars-in-a-funny-zombie-halloween-commercial-for-kmart-.html)... 20th [#onset](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/onset?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVKEYwFvAFeZz1h4JjUlJLNpmDg6XrB1LPzryG5Ktux3Y9zZvDNuNNZIkEbhrEldXlGIlS-EWaRVe_gvUnmcemcfA-FGdGEhLxxpd8HToni1PEVXOcUnlTomiOVTRFz30No-8pFPLOoex9unbpTcWQiLd7LPmUuqOGgI3pNVmU06JqVQnuPMP9ORrsf_kWblrk&__tn__=*NK-R) [starring in a Lifetime movie](http://soultravelers3new.local/2020/03/heavenly-reyna-stars-in-movie-fame-at-a-deadly-cost-on-lmn-.html) !!  
Because [friends are  important with travel for a kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html#more "friends important for travel kid"), she also sometimes got several celebrations. Like she did in [southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "southern spain road trip"), since we were never there on her birthday and before we left Barcelona she had a wonderful celebration with her best friend there. Last year she gave herself a birthday party with a friend & loved it. This year she is having a  big party on twitch 25 hours and a big party in Bel Air at a friends home.

Needless to say we love our baby and it has been a wild and wonderful ride and the best blessing of our lives. Parenting is hard work and I have no idea how people manage with more than one. But it was also the most rewarding aspect of our lives. Finding these photos brought all these memories back. Our wedding vow was to her and also to co-create heaven on earth. It feels like we have lived up to that vow and we are not done yet!

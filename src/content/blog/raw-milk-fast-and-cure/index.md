Did you know a [raw milk cure](http://www.realmilk.com/health/milk-cure/ "raw milk cure") for many severe diseases was made popular by  Mayo Clinic founder, Dr. J. R. Crewe M.D.? We have been drinking [raw goats milk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/best-fresh-raw-goats-milk-penang.html "raw goats milk"), plus making [raw goats milk kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "raw goats milk kefir") as part of our using [diet to cure cavities](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "cure caviteis naturally") protocol ( with [bone broth,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/how-to-make-nourishing-bone-broth-recipes-to-heal.html "bone broth")  avoiding [phytic acid](http://www.westonaprice.org/food-features/living-with-phytic-acid "phytic acid") and other things) along with my goals to [improve](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "travel and health") my [health](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "health tips") and lose my excess weight permanently.

It is working well for us and I wll be writing more about this. I am happy that we just found a great and open minded M.D. here who is willing and excited to work with us on this and help with tracking blood work results. She has been a leader in using probiotics for 12 years with great results with her patients, but was not familiar with much of the research that I shared with her, but open to learning together.  
  
Somewhat by accident we have been doing a semi raw milk fast and mainly eating just one meal lately as the raw milk and kefir and cheese etc, are all very filling. Raw milk fasts have become very popular on [healthy food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy organic food") type blogs lately as many people find that it works for them.

Dr. Crewe's "real milk cure" consisted of drinking vast quantities of raw, unpasteurized milk, plus fasting and bed rest. The results he wrote, "have been so uniformly excellent that one's concept of disease and its alleviation is necessarily changed."  
  
**RAW MILK FAST CURES**  
  
If I had access to my own grass fed animal I would do a full raw milk fast cure as I have been quite fascinated with the various stories in cybespace from people doing that, but at the moment I can't put that much money into raw milk, so we do our mini fast. Not to fast, but to use the raw milk as a cure and it seems to work for us so far ( about 2 months into it).  
  
Here are some of the fascinating stories including the woman who healed  herself of severe Lime disease:

Bernarr Macfadden wrote _[The Miracle of Milk](http://www.milk-diet.com/classics/macfadden/macfaddenmain.html)_  a  how-to book ( free)  on curing chronic diseases with milk as did Charles Sanford Porter in _The Milk Diet_ and _Goat Milk Magic_, by Dr. Bernard Jensen is another amazing testimonial.

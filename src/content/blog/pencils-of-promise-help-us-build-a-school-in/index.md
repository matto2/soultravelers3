If you listened to 13 year old [Mozart's speech at the Global Education Conference](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/11/global-citizen-innovative-kid-speaker-at-global-education-conference.html#more "13 year old trilingual inspiring speech at Global Education Conference"), you know she has a passion for wanting to make a difference and help others. She is a big fan of youth activist Malala Yousufzaia who said,  
  
“Let us pick up our books and our pens. They are our most powerful weapons. One teacher, one book, one pen, can change the world,”

**EDUCATION CREATES OPPORTUNITY AND SAVES OUR PLANET**  
  
There are 67 Million children in the world without access to education and education (particularly of girls living in poverty), can save the planet and transform lives.  
  
“Over the past decade, there has been an attitude shift in many countries in recognizing at the highest political level that it’s important to educate children, girls in particular. It’s important not only for the girls themselves but also for the country.” -  Pauline Rose, UNESCO Director of the EFA Global Monitoring Report

**WHY GUATEMALA?**  
  
In Guatemala only 5% of rural indigenous girls ever finish primary school. Pencils of Promise is making  a huge difference there and in other countries. Mozart is a Latina with Spanish as one of her mother tongues, so she is excited that when she visits this school and country, she will be able to connect deeply.  
  
“The people who want to keep the status quo always oppose girls’ education because it moves societies and changes the world, and they are afraid of change,” Mariam Khalique

We met world traveler, philanthropist. and founder of this fabulous POP charity, [Adam Braun on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamBraun "Adam Braun on twitter") and he loved our story as much as we loved his. He personally invited us to work with [Pencils of Promise](https://twitter.com/PencilsOfPromis "Pencils of Promise") and we were thrilled by the opportunity because we think they are doing amazing things.

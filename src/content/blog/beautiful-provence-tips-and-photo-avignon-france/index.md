Avignon is the magnificent medieval Papal gateway to Provence with a rich history as it was once the capital of Christendom.  The campsite is on a vast green island (Barthelasse Island) facing the city  
with gorgeous views of the Avignon skyline like the Pont d'Avignon and the Palace of the Popes. One is only 5 minutes away from the historical city center by charming ( free) shuttle boat, which makes it easy to tour and then come home to a delightful park-like atmosphere with pool, jacuzzi,[kids club](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "FREE KIDS CLUBS IN FRANCE") restaurant and more.

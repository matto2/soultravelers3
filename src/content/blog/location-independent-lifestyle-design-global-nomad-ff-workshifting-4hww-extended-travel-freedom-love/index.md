There are so many ways to describe the [new 21st century trend](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/seth-godin-lynchpin-education-travel-new-economy-digital-nomad.html) of [workshifting](http://www.workshifting.com/), [4-Hour Workweek](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/the-4hour-workweek-review-by-world-traveling-family-rich-global-digital-lifestyle-design.html), [location independent](http://www.ehow.com/how_4618895_be-financially-location-independent.html), [global nomads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_nomad) living a [digital nomad lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) of [extended travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) , ultra mobility and greater freedom. Perhaps no term describes it completely as there are so many ways to do it. Last week we started this [Twitter #FollowFriday](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/travel-blogger-love-followfriday-on-twitter-social-media-best-in-travel.html#more) with [Travel Bloggers and Travel Writers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/travel-blogger-love-followfriday-on-twitter-social-media-best-in-travel.html#more).  It turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected. That is part of the joy with [Twitter and travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/twitter-travel-20.html) as you just never know what will happen next.

One of the fantastic things about [Twitter](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3) is I get to meet people from [all over the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) in lots of different blog niches and businesses. I have a lot of interests, so this is a good thing. I will do much more on [travel bloggers  and travel writers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/travel-blogger-love-followfriday-on-twitter-social-media-best-in-travel.html), as well as cool people who are minimalists, multi-lingual, expats, RVers, moms, frugal, innovative educators, simplicity folks, green living, book lovers and more.

Today,  I want to focus on my favorite Lifestyle Design Global citizen types. There are so many fabulous ones that I will have to do several posts just on this category, but here are some great ones to check out ( in no particular order):

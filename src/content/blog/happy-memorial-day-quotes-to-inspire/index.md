On this beautiful Memorial Day in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "top california travel destinations"), as the travel seasons begins, I am remembering my great grandfather who loved to travel like we do,  but most of his travel around the world, was due to his experience with being in wars. It seems ironic because he was a very peaceful man, but he had seen much war.    
  
This popular beginning-of-summer American holiday began as a remembrance for those who died in the civil war, but has spread to honor all who died in wars. Each year, the President of the United States asks Americans to observe Memorial Day as a day of prayer for  permanent peace.

Let me share three quotes for him and for all of us on this day of prayer:  
  
"On Memorial Day, I don't want to only remember the combatants. There were also those who came out of the trenches as writers and poets, who started preaching peace, men and women who have made this world a kinder place to live" - Eric Burdon  
  
"Ceremonies are important. But our gratitude has to be more than visits to the troops and once a year Memorial Day ceremonies. We honor the dead best by treating the living well. - Jennifer M. Granholm  
  
"It isn't enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it. One must work at it." - Eleanor Roosevelt

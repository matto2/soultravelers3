[Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/good-morning-pr.html "PROVENCE") is an ideal place to [vacation as a family in France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/darling-dordogne-vacation-holiday-for-families-in-france.html "VACATION HOLIDAY FRANCE") and take your kids. So much to do, spectacularly beautiful, good weather, great food, culture, and each village has it's own special flavor. We've spent months and months exploring Provence many times on our [family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "AROUND THE WORLD FAMILY TRIP") and will continue to return.  
  
As I am mention in my [Best European Family Vacations](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best european family vacations") post, [Paris with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/paris-for-families-walking-the-left-bank.html "Paris with kids") is fabulous, and you might enjoy our fun  [Paris travel guide](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/paris-france-travel-guide-by-mozart.html "Paris travel guide"), but France is better yet when you combine it with some more relaxed time in sunny Provence.  
  
I first fell in love with the [South of France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beach-fun-french-riviera-style-france-family-travel-bucket-and-spades-provence-south-of-france.html "SOUTH OF FRANCE") almost 40 years ago when I was in my twenties. I was living in Milano, Italy and my boyfriend kept his yacht in Antibes where we visited almost every weekend to explore and relax. In some ways, little has changed in this lovely area and it's a joy to share the enchantment as a family. Yes, it is romantic for a single or couple, but fun for families too and can be done on a low budget even in high season.  
  
In the photo above our daughter is exploring the [Midi canal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_du_Midi) area of [Agde, France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agde), near our campsite called [Le Neptune,](http://www.campingleneptune.com/) where she so enjoyed the [free kids camps](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "Free kids camps") in French.

I realize as I write this just how many wonderful places in Provence I still need to write about, but this will give you a start for ideas on explorations. What is your favorite place in Provence? If you haven't been yet, is it on your wish list?

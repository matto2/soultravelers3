Family travel, even in historic  
places, is often about nature and  
simple pleasures, at least for us

[Family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html), even in historic places, is often about nature and simple pleasures, at least for us on [our world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html) it is, as we think these things are so important. We have been to [Verona,  Italy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/romeo-juliet-in.html) four times since 2006 on our [non-stop world tour](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html) and we love the little farm that we stay at and the people who run it. This f[arm stay campsite](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/02/romeo-juliet-in.html) is prettier in person than the website would indicate. [Verona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona) is a beautiful city made famous by Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the [opera there at the Arena di Verona](http://www.arena.it/en-US/HOMEen.html), an a[ncient Roman coliseum](http://twitpic.com/cnotx),  [is spectacular](http://twitpic.com/cnntq) and a must-see for every family.  
  
Staying on this farm allows us to enjoy the [cultural advantages of Verona](http://twitpic.com/cnfdc) and also bask in the simple joys of Italian farm life, surrounded by grapes, peach, pear and apple orchards and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. They used kiwi's and grapes to give privacy to the small motorhome and tent camping area of their farm and Mozart just looooves to pick them and eat them. They have several varieties and they are all delicious.  

They also make wonderful snacks,  jams and deserts out of this fresh bounty of produce in the Italian way which we also loved. What fun- free delicious food, time in nature,  natural learning, cultural advantages and connection with locals on a farm. Family travel at it's best!

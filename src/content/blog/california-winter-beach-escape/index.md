 **CALIFORNIA DREAMING ON SUCH A WINTERS DAY**  
  
In our 8 plus years of [non-stop world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "family world travel"), we've managed to return to California every other year to see family and friends and keep Mozart connected to her roots. She is an [amazingly well-traveled](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "amazing well traveled kid Mozart")  [global citizen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/kid-world-citizens-inspiring-speech-at-global-education-conference.html "global citizen kid") who knows the world well, but she is also a California girl at heart, with dear friends and family here, and remembers her first 5 years in [our California dream home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "dream home") very well.

“Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.” - Terry Pratchett

[Capitola](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "capitola") is a spectacularly beautiful area and my Mom lives near the beach, on the river, surrounded by ancient redwood trees, so morning walks to the beach to put our [feet in the healing sand](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/grounding-earthing-nature-better-health.html "grounding barefoot healing") is part of our family ritual.

“to travel is worth any cost or sacrifice.” - Elizabeth Gilbert  
  
We feel so blessed by [our travel lifestyle,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "our travel lifestyle") but one price we pay is much of our relationship with family and friends is via regular Skype video calls. I don't think we could have traveled this long without that regular connection and in many ways I think it keeps us closer and more appreciating each other and our time together than if we had stayed living nearby.

“What is that feeling when you're driving away from people and they recede on the plain till you see their specks dispersing? - it's the too-huge world vaulting us, and it's good-bye. But we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies.” - Jack Kerouac  
  
After time with my side of the family at the beach, it was time to hit the road, over Pacheco Pass and Hecker Pass, a 3 hours drive to Fresno in the Central Valley and experience another part of California beauty and pleasures while visiting Davinci's side of the family.

When we lived in Santa Cruz, we use to do Christmas at my mothers house and New Years and a ski trip to Yosemite with our Fresno relatives, so this is the first Christmas that we did in Fresno. His sister waited for us to arrive, so we could trim the tree together.

Time together with family is all about simple pleasures like Mozart sharing photos of her friends with her aunt or baking healthy treats together. ( Recipes coming!).  
  
Davinci's sister here, also has a grown daughter nearby, so we spent Christmas Eve at their house. She is Mozart's cousin, but she has two teen age boys, so these cute second cousins have always seemed more like cousins to Mozart.  
  
Her grandmother on this side died before she was born, so her aunt is both aunt and paternal grandmother substitute.  Since we had Mozart late in life and we both have siblings who had their babies very early in life, she has always bonded well with her [2nd cousins](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "2nd cousins"). Playing games with the older teens ( and girlfriend)  was a big part of the fun for her.

“But that's the glory of foreign travel, as far as I am concerned. I don't want to know what people are talking about. I can't think of anything that excites a greater sense of childlike wonder than to be in a country where you are ignorant of almost everything. Suddenly you are five years old again. You can't read anything, you have only the most rudimentary sense of how things work, you can't even reliably cross a street without endangering your life. Your whole existence becomes a series of interesting guesses.” - Bill Bryson  
  
In some ways, America is a foreign country to us, yet oddly familiar too and we cherish all the little moments in a new way because of our world travel.

Life slows down over the holidays, we go mostly unplugged and connect again.

Being lumped together in the teen crowd made it an exciting, special Christmas memory for Mozart.

Of course eating is always an important part of the Christmas ritual and we are grateful that our families on both sides have indulged our [strict diet](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "curing gum disease naturally") on our [healing journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "healing journey") which allowed us to keep to our health goals while indulging in delicious food.  
  
One great thing about California, is it is probably one of the easiest places on earth to hunt down healthy food. We don't eat conventional grow n foods ( turkey, eggs, dairy, veggies etc) , processed foods, sugar, bad fats, grains and more, but managed to have a scrumptious feast!

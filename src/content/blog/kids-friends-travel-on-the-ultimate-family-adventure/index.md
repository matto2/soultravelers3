**TRAVELING THE WORLD AS A FAMILY WITH SCHOOL AGE KIDS**  
  
We started our ["Location Independent"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1AspeNfcGE "location independent"),  "[Lifestyle Design](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "lifestyle design")" or ["Travel Lifestyle"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVWTLrFMI0c "travel lifestyle") in [2005 when we sold our home and most of our belongings](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "sold our home and belongings") beginning a [trendsetting minimalist digital nomad lifestyle.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html "minimalist digital nomad lifestyle") Then we started our non-stop international family travel in 2006, and have been to 39 countries on 5 continents with a school age child ( over the last 5 years on just 23 dollars a day per person) , thus have more experience at this ultimate family adventure than anyone we have met or heard about online.

There is no one right way to do this, but relationships are important to us as well as giving our child a solid foundation in every way including pyschologically and socially, so we have been very conscious about providing emotional intimacy support and the ["sure shelter"](http://www.sengifted.org/articles_social/Gross_PlayPartnerOrSureShelter.shtml "sure shelter friends for gifted kids") of long term dear friends...even as we travel the world.

"Traveling in the company of those we love is home in motion" - Hunt

I love this quote because it descibes our [global lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/06/questions-answers-about-soultravelers3-family-travel.html "global lifestyle"). Here are a few things that we have found worked best for us as far as keeping deep friendship connections while living a "home in motion" kind of life. With a single female child who loves people, we find this essential, although we also cherish all the many friends that we meet just once or twice along the way. One can find "roots" in a serial way by having more than one place as "home". The world is our home.

![sweet old friends having fun at the beach at "home"](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833014e5f7402bb970c.jpg)  
  
  

**FIRST RULE -MAINTAIN FRIENDS AT HOME**

We don't go "home" very often, and thus far in the last 5 years of world travel, we have only been home to [Santa Cruz](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/10/family-travel-santa-cruz-california-beautiful-beach-house-homeaway-luxury-rental-home.html "santa cruz") and the USA twice and each time for just two weeks, yet we have maintained our old friendships there. Today that is easier than ever via free webcam calls, email, Facebook etc and we do that with friends from all our different global "homes".

That said, kids tend to live in the now and we limit Mozart's online time because I don't think it is valuable to be online texting and talking constantly with friends at a distance. That can get in the way of connecting with friends deeply locally and being present in the "now", thus we are BIG fans of as much unplugged time as possible. Staying connected does not mean staying up with every tiny detail as if you are still living there. Friends are important, but ultimately parents are more important and one learns about relationship first from family.

We DO make it a priority to spend quality time with friends when we are home. One of the highlights for Mozart while staying at our [beautiful beach home while visting Santa Cruz](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/homeaway-santa-cruz-beach-house-vacation-rental-review-best-family-friendly-lodging.html "beach home rental vacation home in santa cruz california"), was having a sleep over with one of her best friends there and hanging out at the beach and mall with her and various friends. We've always appreciated her special friends there and the families that they come from who have similar values that we have about loving and caring. Mozart has been friends with this beautiful child since she was four.

**PICK A VILLAGE - IMMERSE IN LANGUAGE VIA A LOCAL SCHOOL FOR A BIT - RETURN REGULARLY**

One of our "homes" is a tiny [white village in Andalusia, Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html "white village in andalusia, spain") near the sea and [we picked it randomly off the internet before arriving in 2006.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "how to pick a winter rental in spain")  From our [first day of school in Spain](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html "first day of school in spain") until our l[ast day of school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "last day of school in spain second language immersion") we not only got amazing language benefits that allows our child to speak, read and write Spanish like a native, but a wonderful opportunity to immerse deeply in the culture and make many dear life long friends ( primarily all from this village, but also a few expats from many countries).

We are [eclectic unschoolers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "eclectic unschoolers using travel to educate"), but are not above using schools to our advantage and I think language and cultural immersion happens best and easiest this way. We made up a system where we travel most of the year, but spend five months in the winter at a slower pace, [immersing via a local school for language](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel/comments/page/2/ "immersing in a local school for language while traveling"), resting, rejuvenating and  doing only short trips from a base during this time. We returned to this [village](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/02/village-people.html "andalusia village people") and school for four winters consecutively  and now we return regularly to visit with our good friends there and allow Mozart time to play and reconnect.

**CLOSE AS COUSINS SINCE 2006**

Yes these three trilingual girls have been as close as cousins since 2006 when we met upon our arrival in Spain. Often life seems to send us blessings on our travels and one of our great gifts in Spain is this darling family that we called our "guardian angels". By chance, I met the dad online on a global piano forum in 2005 when I was trying to figure out how we would deal with kidlet's piano lessons as we travel the world. Lo and behold it turned out that this most helpful person happened to live a short distance away from the village in Spain that we picked. What are those odds, eh?

If you have been with us from the beginning, you might remember how [they were our first guests](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/11/first-guests-in.html "first guests in our home in spain"),  he [saved us from a snake and dealing with internet woes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2006/11/snake-mac-piano.html "saved us from a snake and internet woes") when we first arrived in 2006 and how they spoiled us with a [marvelous home cooked meal in Malaga](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/02/marvelous-meal.html "marvelous meal in malaga") ( and she taught us about her native Mate as she is from Argentina, he from Spain and they had met in London). Or more spoiling at their venture into the [best beach restaurant in Benalmadena Costa.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/07/best-beach-restaurants-on-costa-del-sol-puerto-marina-.html "best beach restaurant in Benalmadena Costa near Fuengirola")

Their youngest was in diapers when we first met, but every winter we enjoyed spending time together and they saved our butts more than once. So helpful to have local friends who understand how everything works and have experience living in foreign countries where they did not speak the language. We could gab for hours while the kids played. We were sad to see them move to London before our last winter there, but it's fun for us to reconnect with them when we visit London like we did this fall and plan to do it again in June.  When they lived in Spain, Spanish was the girls dominant languge so it was funny to hear them with perfect British accents now.

**GO SLOW - GET TO KNOW THE LOCALS - RETURN REGULARLY - GRAVITATE TO GOLDEN PEOPLE**

Barcelona is another one of our "homes" and it is [several days drive away from our home in Andalusia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "grand tour europe via motorhome") via our motorhome. In 2006, we fell in love with an amazing [luxurious beach resort in Barcelona that is very cheap](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "luxury beach resort in barcelona that is cheap") and great for families so we spend at least a month or two there every year. Usually in spring and fall on our way to and from southern Spain where we store our RV and Barcelona is a perfect "jumping off point" for Europe ( via boat ferry to Italy or drive to France or not far from a ferry to UK etc).

Here we were also blessed by meeting an amazing local family. Remember that [delicious paella](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html "delicius paella") that they've made for us? One of our great delights in going back there is we get to spend time with them and we also keep up from time to time as we roam via webcam calls. They love traveling as a family  as much as we do and Mozart and their daughter are already planing their own round-the-world trip when they get into their twenties. We all cherish these angels and have lots of fun together.

This resort is a perfect place for tweens because they can have a lot of freedom in a safe way. They can explore, sleep-over, play in thier private kids tent playroom, swim in one of the 3 pools, go to the on-site  store or bakery, tour sometimes together, go to the kids disco at night, make meals, watch a little Spanish TV, ride bikes, watch movies outside, play with kids who speak many languages in the kids club, ( Mozart often translates between her only Spanish speaking and only English speaking friends), make things, catch butterflies at the zoo and more.

**FIND A NEW PLACE - ADAPT- IMMERSE IN A NEW LANGUAGE AND CULTURE - MAKE NEW FRIENDS**

We came to [Asia in November](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/11/first-thanksgiving-in-asia.html "asia in november thanksgiving") primarily to [immerse our child in Mandarin through a local school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "immerse in mandarin chinese through local school in asia") here in [Penang.](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330147e178ae0c970b "penang how and where to live") So far it is working wonderfully on every level including friendships. The resort we happened to land in is perfect for families and our child already has a posse of wonderful friends here that she plays with daily. The variety is quite unusual and rich..a Hungarian, a Chinese-Canadian/ Australian , a Korean/Chinese Canadian, an Indian/Chinese/Malay, a Spanish speaking bilingual American from New Mexico and more. The kids go to many different various schools or homeschool.

The majority of kids in her school are Chinese Malaysias, but they are also from Thailand, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore,Japan, Laos, Indonesia mainland China and Pakistan. Her best friends in her class are from Indonesia ( 5 cousins) and two Korean boys, although she also enjoys the older Thailand girls who tell her daily that they love her. Mozart wants to bring her uniform back to show her friends in Spain but alas we pack too light, so we will store a few things here while gone & just have photos to show.

She is really enjoying her friends here and we plan to return for several more winters. We are very pleased that it is going very well and know that we are creating more friends for life. Part of what makes it work for us always is we pick child friendly areas and take the time and effort to connect with good people plus encourage and make time for her relationships.

Are there any questions that you have that I have missed?

Do you love gardens? [We do](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/timing-is-eve-1.html) and it is one of the things we sometimes miss with our [long term travel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1AspeNfcGE). Luckily, [we](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/la-alhambra.html) find [lots](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/2008/02/boboli-gardens.html) of [beautiful gardens](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-norway-oslo-vigeland-sculpture-park-mother-child.html#more) where [ever](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/cappadocia-cave.html#more) we [go](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-germany-romantic-road.html#more) and in our winter rental home [in Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia), we can make a little winter garden.

This garden is in Spain too, on the [Costa Brav](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/top-10-costa-brava-secret-gems-spain.html)a just north of Barcelona, where we took a little excursion in July. I think that somewhere along the way on our trip we will have to do some [WOOFing](http://www.wwoof.org/) (working on organic farms) just for the pure joy of it! I've also always wanted to do the work/study program at [Esalen](http://www.esalen.org/) which is one of my favorite places in the world with an [amazing garden](http://www.flickr.com/photos/surharper/sets/72157600216276875/) and [healing hot tub](http://www.esalen.org/place/hot_springs.html)!

Ah, gardens...they make me smile, perhaps even more so at harvest time. How about you?

Head north to [beautiful Bibinje](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl6fuuxsc3u/) near [Zadar](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjbJW7kMlGM/)! It is a quirky seaside region rich in history and [natural beauty](https://youtube.com/shorts/xKwXxzk6Myo?si=vjF0DGlS5SXb7uu8%20) and still relatively undiscovered.  
  
When we visited the [Best Ocean View Vineyard in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/10/best-ocean-view-vineyard-in-europe.html), we were staying in Bibinje. This lovely village is blessed with lush, natural landscapes and decorated with the crystal-clear waters of the Adriatic Sea. [Bibinj](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cjsv7-0D1_i/)e is located on the north coast of Dalmatia, just 8 kilometers south of the city of Zadar. It is quieter and cheaper than Zadar, but close enough to enjoy everything in this area.

 **If you're looking for the best travel tips for a trip to Croatia, here are 10 great tips for visiting Bibinje:**

**1) VISIT IN THE FALL**

As I have often said, autumn is the best time to [travel to Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2022/07/cheapest-way-to-travel-europe-budget-travel-must-read.html#more) as one can [skip the heat and crowds of the summer high season](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html "How To Travel Without Crowds In High Season!")! Additionally you can enjoy much better prices during the falll or spring shoulder seasons. [Bibinje](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl6fuuxsc3u/) was included in my " [Europe in Autumn: 10 Best Fall Destinations](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/10/europe-in-autumn-10-best-fall-destinations.html#more)!" post. In October the weather was like summer, but crowds and prices like winter.

# **2) WATCH WORLD'S BEST SUNSETS  
**

“Zadar has the most beautiful sunset in the world, more beautiful than the one in Key West, in Florida, applauded at every evening.” - Alfred Hitchcock  
  
Bibinje is right next to Zardar, so one enjoys the same stupendous sunsets. Only in Bibinje you have them all to yourself without crowds. Like Hitchcock, I have seen amazing sunsets around the world, ( including [Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/09/world-famous-key-west-sunset.html) many times) but I agree with him that they are the best in the world in this area.

# **3) SWING ON THE BIBINJE OCEAN SWING**

During the day or at sunset ( like me above) don't miss the opportunity to take a selfie on Bibinje’s iconic swing. Kids and adults both love it. We adored this charming wooden swing right on the beach with a perfect view of the sea and the opposite island Ugljan.

# **4) STROLL THE BEACH PROMENADE AT NIGHT  
**

Strolling on the beach promenade is inviting at any time of the day, but a special treat at night. We could not help but linger long after sunset as the glow of the night continued with the relaxing waves lapping the shore. The smell of the sea and warm meals served in Mediterranean-style restaurants fills the air.

# **5) SUNBATHE/SWIM AT THE BEACHES  
**

Love the sun, sea and sunbathing & swimming? Bibinje beaches mesmerize with a stunning palette of turquoise, azure and cobalt backed by a soaring landscape of green mountains. The water is clear and not too cold. This is a slow-paced, laid-back sunny getaway and what many beachgoers dreams are made of. On a coast length of about 5 kilometers, there are 7 beaches to enjoy. Each one has something a little different to savor.

# **6) ENJOY THE FLOWERS  
**

Wondering around lovely Bibinje and it's beaches, we loved the flowers. Lots of Bougainvillea plants that thrive in this Med weather, roses and even lovely wild flowers close to the sea.

# **7) LET THE LAPPING WAVES RELAX YOU WITH ASMR  
**

Bibinje is a very relaxing place and the gentle waves along the shore add to this ambiance. Many listen to ASMR laping waves online to calm down and refresh. Here one can do it daily effortlessly.

# **8) TAKE A BOAT RIDE**

Boating (in all shapes and sizes) is a popular adventure in Bibinje. The largest marina on the Croatian coast is located here - D-Marina Dalmacija. With one of these motor boats ( in various sizes), your excursion options are endless. With boats available for day rentals, weekend getaways, week long excursions or longer, boat rental companies provide flexibility to suit your preferences.

# **9) ENJOY DINNER AL FRESCO AT SUNSET  
**

  
From fantastic street food to endless restaurants serving authentic Dalmatian and Mediterranean cuisines, foodies will love Bibinje. Many taverns and restaurants have sunset views and outdoor dining. There is always a rich selection of locals specialties like shellfish, seafood, grilled meat, roasted lamb, and fritters. Dalmatian cuisine is considered to be one of the healthiest cuisines and live music makes it all an experience to remember.

# **10) SLIDE ON THE BIBINJE OCEAN SLIDE**

  
 Like the charming, unique wooden swing above in number 3, this adorable wooden slide structure going into the Adriatic sea is unique to Bibinje. This is definitely a place that knows how to have fun in sweet ways and make the most of it's assets.

#  **VISIT ZADAR**

Remember, that the famous Old Town Zadar is just 8 kilometers away from Bibinje. When you visit this 3,000-year-old city, you will find countless more attractions, like cool beaches, views, Lions Gate, the Roman forum and the famous sea organ!

It reminded me of the nightly sunset celebrations in Key West and the excitement and crowd grows waiting for nature to awe us.

World-famous architect Nikola Bašić  created the Sea Organ & Greeting the Sun Light construction that adds to the unique fun. The Sea Organ makes music by the movement of the waves and during the day, sunlight is converted into energy and after sunset there is an impressive play of light for all to enjoy!

We were delighted and surprised to visit the [best ocean view vineyard in Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/10/best-ocean-view-vineyard-in-europe.html#more) here. I wrote about it last week with lots of tempting photos. It is a "must see" and not far from Bibinje and Zadar.

 We loved the street art like this photo on a wall near the beach that captures the essence.  If you are looking for a fantastic off season beach bargain, for travel or as a digital nomad, you can't beat Bibinje!

Since we had spent months in Dubrovnik before and knew it well, I looked for a place with a great view and great price, so if things got hectic, we at least could enjoy the view from our room. It was even better than expected!  
  
![The Best Stunning Airbnb in Dubrovnik & Low Budget!  table and room with a view ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b75179b9fc200b-150x150-1.jpg)  
The weather was summer like and perfect, the worst of the summer crowds were gone, so just relaxing at the table in front of our room or in our room, morning, noon, sunset, sunrise or night was paradise.   
  
![The Best Stunning Airbnb in Dubrovnik & Low Budget!  swing in paradise ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b7519e0b32200c-222x300-1.jpg)  
  
They had a cute adult swing and morning coffee or tea with breakfast and a breathtaking view starts the day perfectly!

This stunning view just made it all so special.

As soon as you open the door to this apartment all you can see is a serene paradise  
  
![The Best Stunning Airbnb in Dubrovnik & Low Budget!  cat and window view ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b68530d8e8200d-scaled-1.jpg)  
The view out our window next to the bed included a cute kitten who was fond of us and was purring away until we came outside to join her.

It was definitely a romantic spot for couples of all ages and good for a long or short stay

The sunsets from the room were awe inspiring

s3.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5502a9507883302b68530d9b8200d-pi)  
I took a mirror selfie in the room to try and show how stunning the sunset was out of our door

But, of course, photos can never fully capture the splendor of such a moment

Breathtaking! So we will be back & will recommend this place & experience to all we know!

Every moment brought new colors and shades.

 We even got a little work done as the sunset turned into night and the weather was balmy.

The apartment was small, but adorable, cutely decorated, very clean and efficient.

This view shows the outside. We stayed in the room with the blue shutter windows in the bottom left and the sweet family lives in the top 2 floors. To get a view like this it is a bit precarious going up to this place and there are tons of stairs, but I am  70 and that was not a problem for us.

We travel light and had no problems bringing our suitcases up and down, but just know these things come with this kind of view. For some, that might be a "down side" but it was not for us.

We took a taxi or uber when we visited [Old Town](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2007/09/walking-the-cit.html) while staying here, but there are also local buses that one can take. If you want to be closer to the Old Town within close walking distance, I suggest you look into the campsite I mentioned earlier in this post where we did a long stay in high season as it has hotels, beaches and all luxury amenities, yet is very close to Old Town center. Cruise ships have ruined Dubrovnik like so many small charming cities by over flooding them with tourists, but one can work around their schedules to avoid their insanity and lemming-like crowds.

There are lounge chairs to sun and relax in, but we did not use much as it was just a short stay for us.

 The kitchen was tiny, but very clean, modern and efficient, so worked really well for us so we could keep our budget tight and also help me maintain my strict diet while traveling. We're vanlifers after all and have used kitchens like this for months at a time in rental apartments  and grateful for them.   
  
![The Best Stunning Airbnb in Dubrovnik & Low Budget!  empty nest couples travel ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302b75179eb96200b-150x150-1.jpg)  
This photo we took at the top of the property/home where one catches a taxi or uber to see more Dubrovnik sights. As an empty nest travel couple, we are regularly in touch with our 22 year old daughter Heavenly and have a bit of a running joke of bringing her along with us in a "flat stanley" kind of way. Since we all spent months in Croatia together when she was young with so many happy memories, it was fun to share some of the sites and places with her. Some day we might all come back to this place together or she might jet off to stay here with a friend. It is a classic gem!  
  
Any questions?

This is a joyous long holiday season for us because it is the first time that we have been home for the holidays since we began our non-stop [world travels](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "world travels") in 2006. We are grateful for our amazing memories of Thanksgiving on the road.  
  
We loved our [first Thanksgiving in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/happy-thanksgiv.html "first thanksgiving in spain") and [first Thanksgiving in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/first-thanksgiving-in-asia.html " thankgiving in asia"), our humble T[hanksgiving in Espana](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/thanksgiving-blessings-in-spain-.html "Thanksgiving in Espana") after I [broke and paralyzed my arm](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "broke and paralyzed arm"), that also reminded me of the joy of our early Thanksgiving at home with both families in 2008,  which they prepared for us in early November while we did a two week visit ( our first visit home since we left).

There is just something wonderful about being home for the holidays, especially when you've been far from home on that day for many years. This morning I woke up at dawn to the delicious smell of roasting turkey stuffed with [my mom](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/worlds-best-mot.html "my mom")'s famous dressing. My sister and mother were like two happy elves making magic in the kitchen. How can one not wake up smiling to that? Talk about a meal made with love. Hard work too and my Mom still enjoys this at almost 84.

Now that our kiddo is an [expert on baking cookies](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/baking-cookies-with-champion-chef.html "baking cookies") while traveling, she was thrilled to do some cookie baking with the "world's best cookie baker", my sister, who is the domestic goddess in the family. ( Note she also made that adorable apron Mozart is wearing).

Watching home movies is part of the family fun. How many people have home movies from the 50's? Thankfully, my dad documented much, so I can show movies to my child of my travels and holidays as a kid as well as three of her great great grandparents on film.  
  
Yep, that little bathing beauty kiddo is ME at 5 with my Mom on a USA road trip vacation. My sis just turned the VHS version to DVD so we can take it with us as we enjoy home movie nights on the road, especially during [holidays abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "holidays abroad").

I am also enclosing a few pics of beloved relatives on DaVinci's side in nearby Fresno area that so enriches our stay here. Kidlet is being spoiled by everyone and lapping up all this attention and this precious time together. She is a huggy, affectionate, happy kid.

What can I say? There is really nothing like being home for the holidays and we are thoroughly enjoying this [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") at home this year. We're not fans of the [consumer overkill](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "consumer overkill")  part, but two thumbs up to the LOVE, gratitude and family aspects.  
  
So once in every year we throng  
Upon a day apart,  
To praise the Lord with feast and song  
in thankfulness of heart" Guiterman  
  
Thankgiving Day comes by statute, once a year; to the honest man it comes as frequently as the heart of gratitude will allow." Martin

I am so grateful for this extended time together and time to heal at home. Yesterday, I saw a new doctor who gives me hope that I might finally have found the answer to my [travel related illness](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel related illness") that has plagued me the last year and half. Since I can't eat anything without pain, I won't be able to enjoy this scrumptious food , ( I might steal a bite!)  but my heart is full with the love that permeates this home and my entire family.  
  
What are you grateful for this year? Happy Thanksgiving to all!!

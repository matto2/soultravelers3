[Narbonne](narbonne "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbonne") is a unique town in Provence and very pretty with the [famous midi canal r](midi  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_du_Midi")uning right through it. The architecture seems more like the middle of France, instead of Provence. [Family travel in Provence](family travel provence "http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/good-morning-pr.html") multiple times can mean exploring lots of new places each time along with the tried and true.  
  
This is a photo of Mozart on a hot day on one of the bridges there with the boats and town in the background. Almost all the towns in France are decorated with flowers on bridges and dresssing up the villages and towns main streets,  which is a nice touch.  
  
We stayed at a [European campsite](european campsite "ttp://www.soultravelers3.com/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html") near here called [La Nautique](La  "http://www.ukcampsite.co.uk/sites/details.asp?revid=5604") which was okay, but  outrageously over priced ( almost 50 euros when we were mostly paying 17 to 20 euros in most places this past [summer in Provence](summer in Provence "http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/swimming-canoeing-at-pont-du-gard-france-family-travel-adventures-family-friendly-camping-.html")). Thus we didn't stay long, but enjoyed seeing it, before moving on with our extensive [south of France wanderings](south of france wanderings "http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beach-fun-french-riviera-style-france-family-travel-bucket-and-spades-provence-south-of-france.html#more") this year.

We are on the move now in French Polynesia, Auckland and Australia, so doing short posts until we slow down for the winter and settle into Penang.

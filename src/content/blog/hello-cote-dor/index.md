October 5, 2006

It was an easy 300 or so kilometers  
drive from Paris to our peaceful campsite  
on a beautiful lake within walking distance

It was an easy 300 or so kilometers drive from Paris to our peaceful campsite on a beautiful lake within walking distance to the old town of Dijon. Many people associate this name with mustard only, but it is the north end of the Cote d’Or which many call the finest wine in the world and the old capital of the powerful Dukes of Burgundy. Our pinot noir vineyard was made up of Dijon clones, so this “Grands Crus” area has a special interest for us,not to mention it’s reputation for food.

It was nice to be driving thru the French country side again and we had a nice picnic lunch at one of the road side aires (rest stops). Mozart loves picnics and ran around on the playground and collecting some colorful fall leaves to put in her scrap book.

Did I mention we loooooove our Nuvi GPS? I know, I know, I have mentioned it, but we are still amazed at what a wonderful thing it is and how much easier it makes life when driving in a foreign land. It allows me the luxury of doing some reading and planning on the way. We hope to go on some wine roads here so will use maps for that,but it has been awesome plugging in our camp address and being taken there easily with out much thought or worry. Definitely in the “best investment” category and it makes us grin gleefully every time we take off and hear that voice guiding us perfectly.

We got a kick out of a sign that warns drivers to “slow down” to 110 if it is raining. Not too many people in the states would think that 110 was a safe, slow speed. Makes one of those hmmmm moments to wonder just how much protection one gets by slowing down those 20 points. Crashing at 110 in one of these itty bitty cars just seems incompatible with safety, so it is like why bother.

We just bought some groceries and supplies at a nearby store after checking in, Mozart played in the playground at our campsite with DaVinci when we got back and ran off some steam while I fixed a healthy supper. DaVinci is already snoring and Mozart (who took a long nap on the way here) is watching her beloved PBS Cyberchase (an educational mathy kids show) while I write a few notes and read some more   
to get ideas for the next few days activities.

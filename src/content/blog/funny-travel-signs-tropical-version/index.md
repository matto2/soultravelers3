When you travel as  
a lifestyle, you are going  
to see lots of funny signs.

When you [travel as a lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel as a lifestyle"), you are going to see lots of funny signs. We ran into this cute sign on our [Florida road trip](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "florida road trip") in [Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/key-west-vacation.html "key west vacation") at the [beautiful B&B, Seascape Tropical Inn](http://www.seascapetropicalinn.com/ "best b&B key west"). Yes, there actually were tiny coconuts that fell from this tree, but quite a lovely sound as one sat in the nearby Jacuzzi.  
  
Now I am eating yummy coconuts, tropical fruit, and resting in another Jacuzzi, in yet another tropical location, [Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Penang"), as kidlet studies her [Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Mandarin school penang") here. I still have lots more to write about Florida including reviews of the wonderful places we stayed at like this, but we are still settling in here and hope to get faster internet soon.  
  
I was dealing with [travel health issues](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health issues") for some time, so will be doing a lot of catching up this year as we slow down a little to heal and immerse in Asia. We only have about 1% of our journey and photos on our website because it takes time to blog while traveling, so look ahead to lots of great stories we have yet to tell from around the world!

Time flies when  you are having fun! [Around-the-world family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world family travel") has been the best decision of our lives, but we didn't know this [ultimate adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate adventure") would change and enhance our lives so much before we took off. Have you ever considered packing up your family to [travel around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/around-the-world-with-kids-extended-travel-long-term-travel-families-and-friends.html "travel around the world with kids")? This is the time of year, one tends to review the past, feel gratitude for a life well lived and gain greater clarity on future goals and dreams.  
  
It's really hard to believe more than 7 years have passed since we started our [location independent](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "location independent") [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel lifestyle") and we've been blessed to have experienced so much of the world through [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel"). Wow! Forty five countries on 5 continents so far, living large on just $23/day per person. We've seen so many of these countries very deeply and we never really expected to see so much of our world. Travel like this can't help but change you profoundly.  
  
It seems the [digital nomad life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomad lifestyle world travel"), specifically [global nomading with a kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/nomadic-lifestyle-with-children-.html "global nomad kid"), and [world school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world school ") or [travel for education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "travel for education") suits us all. This still amazes me. Like any life, it's not one without [challenges](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/crazy-travel-ch.html "travel challenges"), but I've grown accustomed to the freedom and just want more and more of that.    
  
In September 2005 we sold [our dream house](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "our dream house") and embarked on this [world traveling dream.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "world traveling dream") We didn't even know if it was possible and had [plenty of fears](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/can-you-travel-with-fear-of-flying-vertigo-claustrophobia-and-agoraphobia.html "fear of flying and travel fears") and [concerns](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/travel-distasters-vacation-nightmares.html "vacation nightmares"). That first year we just did domestic trips and spent most of our time in prep and research, practicing this new life as we turned into a super [minimalist family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family tips") selling off almost all of our possessions and getting all of our "ducks in a row" for even more freedom and [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/learning-while-traveling-travel-homeschool-road-school-abroad-5-best-reasons.html "world travel and homeschool") expansion.

Nobody was doing what we wanted to do, so we made it up and became accidental digital nomad and [lifestyle design pioneers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html "travel lifestyle pioneers"). We never really intended to go so long, but just loved the lifestyle. We never realized our world trip would have a [travel 2.0](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/twitter-travel-20.html "travel 2.0") strong [digital element](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-stay-connected-with-family-while-you-travel-around-the-world.html "using skype with travel") and enhancement to it. Twitter didn't exist in 2005 when we began, Facebook was only a year old, and travel blogs almost non-existent.  Who knew the vast changes that would happen in the last seven years would make [perpetual travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "perpetual travel and early retirement") accessible to all?  
  
Yes, we've done the 26 airport stops, 13 countries, completely around-the-world in 12 months with just a carryon each as well as the [roadtripping](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/rv-in-europe-road-trip-europe-camping-european-style.html "road trip europe") around [Europe in a campervan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "travel europe campervan") for 4 years.

Yet, there are still so many more places we want to visit and linger or return, especially more time in South America and Africa.

[Learning Mandarin in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "learning Mandarin in Penang") was one of our wisest decisions and it was beyond thrilling to visit mainland China this year for the first time with her fluent in Chinese. It made the whole trip so much more enriched and enriching. At her [Mandarin school in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "Mandarin school in China - immersion in Beijing") she tested at 3rd grade level upon arrival and just gained from there.  
  
Where have we traveled to in 2012? California, Penang, KL, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, and  Xi'an. Not as many places as many years, but an amazing journey on so very many levels.

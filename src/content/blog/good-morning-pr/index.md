Mozart looooves hotels better than RV’s or homes she says. So she was happier than a clam to spend the night in a hotel and we all enjoyed the luxury. It was  a very pretty place made out of stone with a large terrace and the breakfast was very special. It was glorious to be in a proper bed, have a large shower all to ourselves without walking outside, and catch up on a little CNN (and cartoons in French for Mozart). What a lovely way to wake up to the joys of Provence!

I love all the elements in this photo that says [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/weird-asia.html "weird Asia") to me including the ever-popular [coconuts that are so much about tropical cultures](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconuts tropica cultures") (that I recently wrote) about including [my kefir recipes](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "kefir recipes").

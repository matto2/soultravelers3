Being Different - 
It's a GOOD Thing!  
  
On a recent morning, just past dawn,  
I watched 1000 uniformed Asian  
kids in a Chinese school,

On a recent morning, just past dawn, I watched 1000 uniformed Asian kids in a [Chinese school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/chinese-school-fun.html "Chinese school"), orderly gather for weekly assembly along with one tiny blond [American girl](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "American girl in Chinese school ") who is younger and smaller than the rest and the only Caucasian. Being different can be a good thing, even and perhaps because of the challenges and lessons learned.  
  
I was touched by how brave my little girl is and how she doesn't even realize it. She not only survived her first day at 10 when both teachers and students stared at her all day, but she has thrived. We have purposely, thoughtfully and carefully, put her in challenging positions from birth, but especially, in the last 7-plus [years of non-stop travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "around the world long term travel as a family ") and [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world schooling").  
  
**BEING DIFFERENT HAS VALUE**  
  
Not just unschool things like [swimming with dolphins in Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/only-place-in-europe-to-swim-with-dolphins-portugal.html "swimming with dolphins in Europe") at eight or climbing Bhutan's risky [Tiger's Nest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html "tiger's Nest") at ten, but also being the [only American](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "only American in Spanish school") in her [class in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html "american in spain school") at six, this [Chinese school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "chinese school in Asia") at 10 and recently at 12, a [Chinese school in Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "best chinese school beijing for language immersion mandarin") where she even bordered there 24/7 for the immersion benefits in her [3 languages and literacy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "language learning multilingual kid").  
  
"To be nobody but yourself in a world doing its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human can ever fight and never stop fighting." - e. e. cummings  

  
We think it is an excellent thing to be different and to do challenging things and will always support her growing in expansive ways. No matter what the environment, humans often feel different, but of course, that is magnified in areas where one IS clearly different, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing.  One has a choice of either embracing it and making the most out of it, or allowing oneself to wallow in negativity and fear. I am so proud that my exuberant child chooses the former and gains strength by doing.  
  
I believe in [Gatto's theory](http://soultravelers3new.local/education.html "Gatto on education") that when kids are in schools, parents are allowing strangers to adopt your child during those long hours and that is even more challenging when it is with a different culture and language. As [homeschoolers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschoolers and travel") by nature, it's been a stretch for all of us to trust schools by dipping into them from time to time for [language and cultural immersion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "raising a multilingual kid- language and cultural immersion"), but worth the effort and challenges.  
  
[![cute, happy girl and heavy backpack and book bag ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8eaa37a970d.jpg "cute, happy girl and heavy backpack and book bag ")](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8eaa37a970d.jpg)  
  
Mozart skipped several grades with this [Chinese school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/chines.html "chinese school tea ceremony"), so that adds to the challenge as well. She was use to a world with lots of [homeschooling freedom](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling freedom and travel"), but adapted quickly to the daily heavy backpack and book bag shown in this photo, getting up at 5 or 6 AM in the dark for the hour commute by van, after school [tutoring](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/tutoring-in-asia-why-asians-get-superior-test-scores.html "tutoring in Asia"), tests, [physics and algebra in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "physics and algebra in Mandarin"), long hours and 6 days of week of Chinese school.  
  
We are also into [organic healthy food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic healthy food"), don't do any vaccinations, or corporal punishment and other out-of-the box thinking, quite different than the cultural norm here, so the [Chinese view of this American student](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/american-student-chinese-view.html "chinese view american student"), perhaps makes her stand out even more.  
  
"Be daring, be different, be impractical, be anything that will assert integrity of purpose and imaginative vision against the play-it-safers, the creatures of the commonplace, the slaves of the ordinary."  
\- Cecil Beaton  
  
As a parent, one never knows what is the right thing or best thing to do, one just tries to trust your heart, inner guidance and trust your child. We're grateful to have more time together than most and we work together as a team, supporting her and also reassuring her that it is awesome to make unique choices and it's okay to participate in a different culture, while still keeping her own culture and beliefs.

**TAKE PRIDE IN DOING HARD THINGS**  
  
This is really an ode to my daughter who I am so proud of as she inspires me! She knows how to make good [friends around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "friends around the world") in [several languages](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "long term travel and making friends"), she volunteered to be the monitor on her first day of school at ten, won the [English elocution contest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/chinese-school-trophy-girl-.html "wins elocution contest") at 10, [sang several solos](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "sang solo like an angel - beautiful girl") in the large school choir in front of thousands, chosen for [Earth Day poem](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/environmental-education-world-school-kid.html "eco education earth day speech"), was the youngest finalist in the singing competition with a very difficult Mandarin song and has done truly great in this school despite the challenges.  
  
This fall she will be 13, so on the cusp of some fabulous teen years ahead, where one needs more than ever, the willingness to trust yourself, do hard things and be unafraid to be unique and different.   
  
I've gathered some favorite quotes as good reminders from wise minds about why this is such an important topic.

**BEST QUOTES ON BEING DIFFERENT  
  
**

"Each second we live is a new and unique moment of the universe, a moment that will never be again  And what do we teach our children? We teach them that two and two make four, and that Paris is the capital of France. When will we also teach them what they are?

We should say to each of them: Do you know what you are? You are a marvel. You are unique.  In all the years that have passed, there has never been another child like you. Your legs, your arms, your clever fingers, the way you move. You may become a Shakespeare, a Michelangelo, a Beethoven. You have the capacity for anything.

If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away."- Henry David Thoreau

When we allow ourselves to exist truly and fully, we sting the world with our vision and challenge it with our own ways of being. " - Thomas Moore

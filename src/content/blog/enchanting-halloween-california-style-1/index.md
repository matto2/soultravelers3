There are not too many places where the weather is divine and one is surrounded by redwoods, river and ocean during a Halloween parade.

Mozart,  dressed as a wild cat, got to be in this sweet Halloween parade at the oldest beachtown in California with her soon-to-be-84 year old [Grandmother ( who's traveled with us)](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "Grandmother who has traveled with us"). We did this with our daughter during her first 5 years of life, but now that she has experienced [Halloween in other parts of the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/03/ahhhumbria.html "Halloween in other parts of the world"), she appreciates it even more.

Not too many places combine Halloween and surfing, but it seems perfectly natural here at this very family friendly beach in charming Capitola.

We've actually been celebrating Halloween all week and returning to places like this pumpkin patch which have good memories for us all.

This year Mozart read Dracula in anticipation on going to Romania, so she got a special kick out of this blow up Dracula at her favorite pumpkin patch.

I never realized that one of the advantages of our [family travel lifestyle](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family travel lifestyle advantages") is that Mozart so appreciates the little details and [overkill of typical American holidays](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "overkill of typical American holidays"). I think most kids who just turned 11 might be a bit jaded and over saturated with it all, but having missed these 6 years of our home country, she just relishes this opportunity and how many happy memories of her early childhood flood back. She is an American kid after all, so special for all of us to re-immerse for a bit.

But of course, it's a LOT about the candy for kids, isn't it? Mozart loves the hunt and enjoyed the folks who threw some and necklaces off their balconies during the parade. That reminded me a bit of the candy throwing in [Spain and Christmas time.

One of the fabulous  things we love here is we get to walk to the beach and many things from our base in California at my mother's home. It's a very beautiful area and it's wonderful to allow ourselves to be enchanted by it again.  One store even gave Mozart a sample of pumpkin ice cream that you see her eating here on our walk and she enjoyed painting that little pumpkin during the festivities at the beach.

We haven't carved a pumpkin jack-o-latern in six years, so that was also a thrill and especially fun to do it amongst huge redwood trees with ocean views.

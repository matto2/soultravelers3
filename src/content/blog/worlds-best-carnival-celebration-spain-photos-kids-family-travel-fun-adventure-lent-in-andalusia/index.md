Are you dreaming of a Carnival

family can enjoy? Think Andalusia

Are you dreaming of a Carnival vacation destination that the whole family can enjoy? Think Andalusia, Spain! It's true [Rio de Janeiro](http://www.jaunted.com/state/Rio%20de%20Janeiro), New Orleans' [Mardi Gras](http://www.mardigras.com/) and [Venice](http://www.destination360.com/europe/italy/venice-carnevale), Italy are all divine and three of my favorite spots, but if you are looking for family friendly travel, I'd go for a small white village where the kids can even join in the fun.

Even the UK Mail names [2 places in Spain as best in the world for Carnival.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1249964/Mardi-Gras-New-Orleans-Rio-Carnival-worlds-best-places-celebrate-Fat-Tuesday.html) Spaniards definitely know how to party and [create community](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/most-magical-mu.html) through [ritual.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html) I love the drums of Carnival that reverberate through the whole village!

This is our fourth winter in Spain in our [lovely village](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/our-village.html) and Carnival just gets better every year. We made this  video one year and I have written about our [first Carnival in 2007](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/carnival-espana.html) and got some [great photos](http://twitpic.com/1saol) in [2009](http://twitpic.com/1saby). I will have to get them up on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/people/23989603@N07/) one of these days.

Mozart has participated every year, but this is the first year that she did it with a group of friends. They decided to do it as American Indians which is fascinating to me because Mozart has some Indian blood in her. Thus kind of like an American Indian pretending to be an American Indian in Spain.

Part of what I enjoyed this year is how much Carnival is a part of Mozart now and how she enjoys doing this with kids in her school and all the families and people in our village. The mothers of all the other Indians were dressed up too, but my injured arm saved me from that fate.

Although 99% of the kids in her school are Spanish and come from this village, her little group of Indians (which spanned from third grade to fifth grade) included a girl from Poland, Italy, England, Scotland and our little American. Early on she was laughing when some boys in her class dressed as prisoners were climbing up a lamp post causing mischief and at the end she took some pictures for some teen friends and had a long chat with a girl in her class dressed up with a blond wig. Carnival is just part of this season in Spain.

This week the kids are out of school for a holiday which adds to the festive mood here that started this past Saturday with the Carnival. People of every age participate from babies to elders, but I think the joy of the children is what I relish the most. And the drums.

Always thrilling to have an excuse for the whole family and village to be a little wild, silly and irreverent, don't you think?

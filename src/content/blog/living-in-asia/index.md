Living in Asia is so  
full of contrasts and  
always full of adventure

Bicycle Tuk Tuks like these are every where in the city and part of the charm from days gone by.  
  
[Life is VERY different in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/04/india-tourist-visa-nightmare-problems-from-se-asia.html "Life is very different in Asia") than in the [USA](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "USA") or [Europe](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "Europe vacation") ( which are also very different from one another), yet the basics remain the same no matter where you are traveling or expat living. One adapts fairly easy to the changes when you do a family long stay and this second time here makes it easier.  
  
It's hot, gritty and often crowded and very dirty on the streets in Asia. So much life takes place outside because of the tropical heat in SE Asia, including much of their eating at [Hawker Stalls](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang Hawker stalls night life") and such, that we regularly see huge rats at bus stops and hanging out. My child even saw one at her [Mandarin School](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Mandarin school in Asia"). It's common to see people plucking dead chickens, chopping fish, cooking outside or see beggars without legs or wheelchairs at the wet markets.

It can be an exciting adventure, but it can also be exhausting and sensory overloading. You never know what you are going to see as you dodge traffic to cross a street literally taking your life in your hands ( DaVinci has been almost run over more than once) or look for a store down tiny, crowded, filthy, alley ways. Sometimes it is [a beautiful temple](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwbU_OGfSQg "beautiful temple"), sometimes a relaxed worker like above, sometimes wild dogs, or sometimes something quite startling.  
  
Have you been to Asia? What most surprised or delighted you?

The beauty of China is  
touching our hearts on  
these sunny, autumn days

The [beauty of China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "the beauty of China travel") is touching our hearts on these sunny, autumn days [exploring Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/china-parks-and-martial-arts.html "exploring Beijing"). We've become more familiar with [Chinese traditions](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/the-beauty-of-traditional-chinese-culture.html "chinese traditions") and symbology while [living in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "living in Penang") and with our child in a [Mandarin school in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin school in Asia"), but being in [Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "Best of Beijing") brings more appreciation of this [ancient culture](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/06/chines.html "chinese culture - tea ceremony").  
  
I love the willow trees, all the red here and the lions which play a big part in Chinese folklore and are usually depicted as more mythical than real. Stone lions rival even [dragons](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/visiting-china-and-dragons.html "Chinese dragons") as the most popular guardians of temples and buildings.  
  
When our child is not [immersing in Mandarin](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "immersing in Mandarin in China for young people") here at her school, she makes a great translator for us as we [tour Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/babies-in-beijing-china-travel-joy.html "tour beijing with kids") and her language skills [enriches our travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "enriches our RTW travel") so much ( and translating is good for her brain). We've helped her [attain the languages in childhood](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "2nd languages in childhood to become global citizen"), but being a [multilingual kid](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child-2.html "how to raise a multilingual kid") makes her the language expert/leader in the family.  
  
By staying with a generous and beautiful local family ( and meeting many others) where most of the members do not speak English, we gain more insight into the every day life of a Beijing family. The beds, the showers, the food is different, but mostly, we find how much we have in common like appreciating family, loving kindness and education.  
  
I am not a person who ever had [Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/08/weird-asia.html "Asia travel") or China on my bucket list, so we came mostly for our child's language acquisition, but I find myself feeling ancient roots here, as if I have been here before and some how it feels familiar like coming home on some level.  
  
I never thought I'd come to China in my lifetime, but I am very grateful that we have. When we visited Tiananmen square, I thought of my trip to Moscow, the USSR and Red Square in 1988 and how these iconic place photos in media affected my upbringing, and how I never imagined that I'd see either in person.  
  
It is not an easy life here and I still worry about the pollution and water/food safety issues, but China is turning into one of my favorite places for many different reasons.

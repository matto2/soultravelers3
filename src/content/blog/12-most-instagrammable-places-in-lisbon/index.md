**1) Pena Palace**

Sintra is only 30 minutes drive from Lisbon, so do not miss it. See it first or do a day trip ( or more) from Lisbon by car or train. Pena Palace is a UNESCO world heritage site, majestic architectural masterpiece  and best fairy tale castle in Europe!   
  

**2) Miradouro de Santa Luzia**

The secret to getting iconic photos in Lisbon, is starting early. We took an uber to save time. Lisbon is known as the city of 7 hills, so it is a fantastic place to get panoramic city and sea views. We had a lot of fun getting our [travel angel photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1kPSfNMQud/) here. Go early because even in January at dawn there was a small crowd. It usually gets very crowded during the day. Even this terrace is Instagram-worthy. Don't miss including the magnificent, blue, typical Portuguese mosaic tiles!

**3) Miradouro das Portas do Sol  
**

Very close to Miradouro de Santa Luzia is another famous viewpoint that is also fantastic at sunrise. It is an easy, short walk away, but a different panoramic view of roof tops and sea. It got warmer as the day went on, but we hit a cold spell that morning and Lisbon was in the 40's. Still it was worth it and the big platform allowed for picturesque views & photos over the famous Alfama district,  city and the Tagus River.

**4)Secret Tunnel of History Lisboa** There is a secret, fun, very instagrammable art tunnel under Miradouro das Portas do Sol that most people miss. There was a Portuguese wedding photographer and couple waiting for it when we were there so early. Wonderful artist Nuno Saraiva has made many colorful illustrations showing the history of Lisbon. From the other viewpoint of the tunnel, you can also see the towers of the São Vicente de Fora church!

The Torre de Belém is a Lisbon classic and one of the most famous landmarks in the city. It is also one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal ( as is Pena Palace). But again, it will depend on where you are staying and much time you have. If you  want to see it without crowds you must come very early like 7 or 8 am, even though it opens at 10 am. We loved it the first time we saw it in 2008. Our [world schooled](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html) daughter [Heavenly](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com) made a spontaneous, classic drawing of it at 7 years old that we will never forget. But our time was short this time and our airbnb was too far away in Graca , so we chose the panoramic hills at sunrise instead. Travel photography always means choosing what works best for you.

 **6) Arco da Rua Augusta**There are really endless photo opportunities at this iconic landmark in Lisbon. Beautiful Rua Agusta is the main commercial street in downtown Lisbon ( Baixa). It does get over run with tourists even in the winter, so go very early. We headed there right after our sunrise shots via uber to beat the crowds. This arch is a symbol of Lisbon. Our first photo for this blog post was taken here from the  other side.

**It is beautiful from every angle and you will want to include the Praça do Comercio ( Commerce Place) the huge pedestrian public square next to it. This area is filled with shops and restaurants and many events are hosted here. The huge Christmas tree was still up when we were there and it was the starting and ending point for a big marathon run. One can even visit the inside of this arch and climb up to the top!**

**We love arches and beautiful architecture and they go all around this square. The waters edge is at one side and many sculptures. So it is always a lively spot with locals, bike riders, tourists and people enjoying themselves. We got lots of differing and [unique travel angel photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkJMNFijbax/) here that you will see soon on [our Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/soultravelers.3/) **[

 The famous pink street is one of the most photographed spots in Lisbon. So you must get there early. Even on a cold winter morning there were some people and tuktuk tourist trains kept arriving for photo stops. This is primarily a night party hangout, but also a fun instagram photo spot during the day.  **![12 Most Instagrammable Places in Lisbon! pink street colorful  umbrellas hot pink fun ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/119ef97cea7a234ff46297949651dc59-scaled.jpg)  
  
 8) Elevador da Bica**Lisbon is known for it's iconic cable cars, so of course they are perfect for Instagram photos. The cable cars are some of the most instagrammable photos in Lisbon! Bica elevator is really the very best place to get cable car photos and videos. It is a super short route and stops for a long time at the top, so lets you take many great photos and play with it. Again, going early helps with the crowds and off season as well.  **<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiUMwlhgNWs?si=PlgXSkJY5VMLMabB" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>**This photo below was taken from inside at the  bottom ( where you can catch it if you want a short ride).

 9) Miradouro da Senhora do Monte**Miradouro da Senhora do Monte is the highest hill that is the best place to see and celebrate a panoramic Lisbon sunset. Even in January when we were there, the crowd was big and celebration happy with local musicians singing and playing. It is the most popular viewpoint in Lisbon, so not to be missed. I even climbed over the fence for this travel angel photo like the young kids. :) Perfect spot for a photo of Lisboa at sunset. Some hike up or take a tuktuk, but we just took an uber since they are cheap and fast.  **![12 Most Instagrammable Places in Lisbon! best sunset celebration Miradouro da Senhora do Monte](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)[

 10) Miradouro da Graça**Another beautiful, but more mellow, peaceful spot for sunset all inclusive viewing of Lisbon, is Miradouro da Graca. It is very close by to Miradouro da Senhora do Monte. Which you can see a bit in this photo to the right. There are places to eat and drink nearby. Truly a perfect way to end a day of touring Lisbon and taking photos!

 **![12 Most Instagrammable Places in Lisbon! best peaceful sunset view Miradouro da Graça](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  
  
 11) Monument of the Discoveries** If you  are doing [family travel](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/09/15-best-family-travel-vacation-spots-to-make-memories-.html) or stay nearby or visit the famous Belém Tower, then make sure  you see this area as well. We didn't have time this recent short visit, but there are tons of great places here to get Instagram photos. **

We loved visiting them last time. The monument is massive and so is the beautiful compass rose and to me they both not only celebrate Portugals Age of  Discovery,  but really that aspect in all  of us travelers. So very inspiring for kids and all of us to celebrate our beautiful world & spirit of adventure.

 **12) Belem pastries food porn**Of course, one also needs some food porn photos on Instagram. You really can not come to Lisbon and not eat the famous pastries.

There are bakeries and pastry shops all over this city and all over Portugal. This [pastry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_de_nata) was truly to die for so we stopped twice and I could have eaten them all day long. We bought it at this shop below as we loved watching them make them in front of us.

These were cute bakeries or Pastelarias too, but we couldn't stop at every one, could we? At least we got photos and that was fun too. The most famous bakery shop for these are [Pasteis de Belem!](https://pasteisdebelem.pt) We loved them on our first visit to Lisbon, so I could not wait to have them again. We did not get back to that area, but the ones we had seemed just as good. Yum!! Get an instagram photo while you eat a bunch! These are worth going  off [your diet](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2023/03/how-i-lost-170lbs77-kilos-at-70.html#more) for!!

This is our second Â [Schengen Shuffle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/05/what-is-schengen-shuffle-travel-how-to-do-it.html), [digital nomad summer](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/09/vacation-vs-full-time-travel-digital-nomad-lifestyle.html) in Bansko as it is one of the cheapest, best weather, walkable, beautiful, least crowded, great internet speed locations in Europe. We prefer arriving after the [Bansko Digital Nomad fest](https://www.banskonomadfest.com)Â to avoid the crowds. All the thermal mineral pools and hot tubs are in nearby ( 9 minutes by taxi) rural Banya ( which literally means bath) and Â all the locals and some digital nomads told us that luxurious [Regnum](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8651896-d15150645-Reviews-Regnum_Banya_Thermal-Banya_Plovdiv_Province.html) was the best one by far.Â

Â This summer we spent all day every Wednesday swimming and soaking in the healing waters & being offline in nature. Long ago when I did a [6 month camping trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/05/is-the-wanderlust-gene-in-your-dna-so-born-to-travel-nomad.html#more) from Boston to San Francisco, we met some locals that showed us (via horse) some natural hot springs near [Big Bend National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_National_Park) & after wards we swam in the cold Rio Grande. That was so much fun that I think that's when I got hooked. Have you found any good soaking spots on your travels?

We would arrive at 9:30 or 10am when it opened and least crowded so we could swim laps first and would have it all to ourselves. One of the great thingsÂ about [Regnum Thermal](https://uk.hotels.com/ho393662/regnum-bansko-hotel-thermal-pools-in-banya-bansko-bulgaria/?locale=en_GB&pos=HCOM_UK&siteid=300000005) is that there are 5 different pools. Two of them are great for swimming laps, the largest being cold and the smaller one a little warmer. There is also a bubbly hot tub with hydromassage jets. My favorite pool is a small but very hot one that goes up to 40c/104F degrees! There is also a shallow children pool with a slide.Â

The viking in me loves the healing mixing of cold and hot ( that we now know is great for longevity! We were both early swimmers and [Gar](https://www.garreynadesign.com) was actually a world class swimmer with tons of medals as he was discovered at 5 to have a natural butterfly dolphin kick. He raced all through his childhood and lettered in 9th grade swimming in high school. We all love swimming and being in nature and I still enjoy his beautiful swimming form!

The sun shifts as the day goes on the weather was perfect our whole stay. Hotter than last summer, but cooler than most of Europe with the climate change sizzling high temps this summer. People from all over Bulgaria come to this area just to enjoy the mountains, nature and all the thermal pools.We loved it as couple travel retreat, but it is also great for families.Â

We would spend all day to get our monies worth and relax deeply.Â Full day use of the mineral water pools is 35BGN ( â‚¬17) for adults and 10BGN ( â‚¬5) for children.There is also a discount after 4pm for those who want to come later. Â In the summer, from 4pm to 8pm, itâ€™s 20BGN per adult and 5BGN per child. Since we used a driver or taxi, we always did a fast [grocery stop at Billa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/08/losing-weight-low-carb-keto-while-traveling-.html) on the way home.Â

At this spaÂ there are also steam, sauna and massage treatments which can be done for additional price.We  
did not do them, but I imagine they are lovely as even the indoor and outdoor changing rooms are high quality.

There is a fun pool bar and small cafÃ©/restaurant that serves food and drinks during the day. We did splurge on our last day with pina coladas at the pool bar which was a blast. Also we splurged a few times on ordering food and eating it at our loungers and especially loved the yummy pizza.( Oddly Bulgarians add mayonnaise and ketchup to their pizza, so we passed on that). Since health was our main focus we mostly just brought our own water and healthy lunch.

Bulgaria is one of the countries in the world with the most natural hot springs. Why not take advantage of that? The luxurious location surrounded by nature, trees, mountain and blue skies just invites relaxation.Â

There is always lovely international music playing so that adds to the enjoyment and kind of puts one in a happy relax trance. One can dance in the water too for a bit of fun exercise. It is funny because they often played songs that our daughter [Heavenly](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7413363/) regularly sings on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/heavenly) so it was a bit like having her with us. Also funny that they regularly played "California Dreaming" which is ironic as we were one of the very few foreigners there and more than likely the only Californians.Â

The healing mineral waters are rich in magnesium, potassium, iron, calcium, sodium, sulfate, hydrogen phosphate, cabonate and bicarbonate.

All of the days were sunny or with a few puffy clouds. Just [cloud watching](https://cloudwatching.org) like my friend Dr. Letty Â Flohr Â recommends added to our healing and relaxation.

Doing fun and creative things together as a couple enriches every marriage. After years of parenting as our focus, we are doing things like this to reinvent ourselves as a couple and individual. After over 30 years of marriage slow travel, adventures and taking time to enjoy the years we have left helps us heal ourselves and transform us after the empty nest phase.Â

One can actually plug in there, but we left the laptops at home and did not bother to use our phone. I loved always seeing the horses in the nearby fields. There was also Â a lot of grass at this resort so I would do some [grounding/earthing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/grounding-earthing-nature-better-health.html) while there.

Right next to this spa is the ancientÂ Murtina bath which is believed to have been built sometime in the 17th century. You can see it in some of the pictures like this one. Due to all the hot springs,Â Banya is one of the oldest settlements in the area.Â It's anÂ Â ancient Thracian settlement from the 5th century. This bath is typical of the Ottoman public baths during that time in the Balkans, built in the period 15-20 century. It was used regularly into the 1950's and was fully restored in 2012.

So relaxing and bathing in healing thermal waters has a long history in this area. We enjoyed these day immensely, mostly just relaxing under our umbrella and enjoying nature. Plus swimming and soaking.Â

# **Love this quote by** Anne Lamott that says it all:  
"You can change the world with a hot bath, if you sink into it from a place of knowing that you are worth profound care, even when you are dirty and rattled. Who knew?"

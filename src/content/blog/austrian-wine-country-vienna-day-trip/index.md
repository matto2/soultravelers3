Did you know there is awesome wine country in [Austria](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/austria/index.html "austria travel tips"), full of [history](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html#more "museum tips for kids"), [beauty](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2010/09/prettiest-church-in-the-world-melk-abbey-austria-european-golden-beauty-on-danube-in-wine-country-.html#more "world's most beautiful church") and fabulous wine, just an hour day trip from [Vienna](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2013/01/full-moon-in-vienna-.html#more "Vienna travel"), along the Danube called the Wachau?Â  One of the [best ways](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/family-travel-photo-austria-melk-joy-in-water.html#more "travel joy") to visit this area is by boat and we think a cruise day trip that you can take your bike along makes it extra special.

There are many picturesque villages, [castles](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2011/10/family-travel-austria-castle-photo-.html "Beautiful castle Europe") and vineyards along the Danube between Melk and Krems, but perhaps Durnstein is one of the most famous. This is the place that King Richard the Lion hearted of England was held captive.

You don't just have to do it as a day trip either, if you want to linger, as it's a charming area that we ended up staying a few months at ( thanks to a freak [bike accident](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html#more "bike accident while traveling")) so do be careful. We loved the beautiful, super cheap ( even in high season) [campground](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "camping Europe") right on the river and later got a monthly rental apartment with locals.

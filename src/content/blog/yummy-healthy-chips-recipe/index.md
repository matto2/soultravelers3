Do you know how easy it is to make delicious [healthy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/health-and-travel/ "healthy food") chips? If you are into [healthy organic food](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy organic food") like we are, you will skip the packaged, processed potato chips that are full of [dangerously unhealthy fats](http://wellnessmama.com/2193/why-you-should-never-eat-vegetable-oil-or-margarine/ "dangerous fats") and let your kid make her own!

Reading things like "[The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food"](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 "junk food addiction")  or watching [Youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 youtube videos") like, ["Sugar: the bitter truth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM "sugar and disease")" help her understand WHY [eating healthy](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "how to eat healthy and cheap in Europe") today is more [important than ever.](http://www.sustainabletable.org/869/impacts-of-industrial-agriculture "sustainable food")

Eating [Chinese food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/peking-duck-in-beijing.html "chinese food - peking duck") in C[hinese restaurants in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/yum-loving-the-food-in-beijing.html "chinese restaurants in China") means waiters with ipads, menus with colored photos, shared eating, chopsticks and some of the best tasting food on our planet.  
  
Oh my gosh, we were soooo spoiled by lovely people taking us out to dinner and lunch when we were [in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "trip to china") (and it is almost impossible for them to let anyone else pay or allow you to take them out to dinner). Food is just inexorbaly part of the [Chinese culture](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/chines.html "Chinese culture") and why perhaps, (along with the taste) Chinese food is popular around the world.  
  
Still, there is nothing quite like having Chinese [food in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/food-in-china.html "food in china") and we were very blessed to be guided by our new Chinese friends who always seemed to know just what to order. I have many more stories to tell about the [yummy food in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-family-vacation-beauty-love-joy-.html "food in china"), but starting with this meal, one of our first in [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/family-travel-beijing-tiananmen-square.html "travel beijing") ( where I got the first [acupuncture treatment](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/yowser-acupuncture-torture-in-china.html "acupuncture treatment in China")).

Originally, we were going to stay with this lovely woman's mother in Beijing, but since she lived rather far out, at the last moment, they decided we should stay with a friend of hers who lived closer into the central Beijing [Mandarin school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "Mandarin school immersion in Beijing") we had our daughter in.  
  
After staying three nghts at [Four Seasons Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/four-seasons-hotel-beijing-review-awesome-luxury.html "four seasons beijing") and three nights at [Fairmont Beijing](http://www.fairmont.com/beijing/ "Fairmont Beijing") (review coming soon), we were ready to live with locals  and get a deeper understanding about [life in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/life-in-china.html "life in china"). Our friend from [China Travel 2.0](http://www.chinatravel20.com/ "china travel 2.0"), Winsor, helped us get from the school via bus and subway to meet at this restaurant and she brought some friends along.  
  
We had a scrumptious meal and conversation ( in [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "learning Mandarin in Asia") and English) and then they drove us to our new home. Does it look like you expected? Have you eaten in China?

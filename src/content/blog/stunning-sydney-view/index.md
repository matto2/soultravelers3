How about waking up to this stunning view of Sydney's magnificent harbor from your bed then with your morning coffee from your desk on a gorgeous day? WOW! This is our second [visit to Sydney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/the-stunning-sydney-harbour-yha-hostel-review.html "visit sydney") and both times we stayed in the CBD posh area called "The Rocks".  
  
**CELEBRATING A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY IN SYDNEY**  
  
We were hosted by [Four Seasons Sydney](http://www.fourseasons.com/sydney/ "four seasons sydney") to celebrate Mozart's 13th birthday ( her 4th continent and 9th country [celebrating a birthday while traveling)](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/celebrating-kids-birthdays-while-traveling.html "celebrating birthdays abroad") on our [world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "most well -traveled kid in the world") and we couldn't have picked a better place as they spoiled us and this view says it all, but I will be giving more details and photosÂ  soon.  
  
**BEAUTIFUL SAN FRANCISCO AND SYDNEY**  
  
There is something about this beautiful city by the bay and the many beaches that reminds us of our beloved home city [San Francisco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/san-francisco-travel-why-we-love-it.html "san francisco travel"), so we love it and the friendly people.  
  
**LONG FLIGHT, WEATHER, FLEXIBILITY AND PACKING LIGHT**  
  
We flew in from [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang"), which was a fairly miserable undertaking while [traveling sick](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "traveling sick challenges "), (including an 8 hour red eye flight and 24 hours travel from door to door), but well worth the effort. We only brought one light sweater or jacket each and mostly summer clothes on our [one carry on each packing method](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/top-travel-tip-for-long-term-travel.html "top packing tips") based on weather reports, so were caught a bit surprised with the dreary, cold, rainy weather upon arrival to Sydney ( and froze in Canberra too one day and thus affected our plans).  
  
One darling reader of our blog, even offered to loan us some warm clothes! Talk about living a blessed life. We actually met this charming family and world travelers with a visit to Manly, so more on that coming soon too.  
  
**NO WORRIES!**  
  
"No worries" as the Australians like to say and I have adopted this great saying. The ugly, cold and dreary weather disappeared and my magical, sunny Sydney was back and we found ways around the weather by museum hopping and [didgeridoo](http://www.giftsatthequay.com/ "didgeridoo sydney best") learning. More on that soon!

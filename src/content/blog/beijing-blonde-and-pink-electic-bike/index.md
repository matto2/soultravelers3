Who doesn't love pink? It seems to be a popular color for electric bikes for [girls in China](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/babies-in-beijing-china-travel-joy.html "girls in China"). We're enjoying all the [bikes in Beijing](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/2012/11/beijing-bikes-and-beauty.html "bikes in Beijing") and my little pink blonde bunny enjoyed this pink bike.

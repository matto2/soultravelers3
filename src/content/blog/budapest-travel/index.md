[Budapest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/family-travel-budapest-hungary-family-friendly-fun-and-educational.html "Budapest travel"), the "city of baths", is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. We were charmed by this world class city at first glance, but knew we had to return to [Budapest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "budapest") when the weather was good to really take in it's full beauty.  
  
Like most of northern Europe, it has a short summer, so we froze last time and ran into rain and short days. This photo was taken as a drive-by  from our motorhome as we headed toward Spain and warmer, sunnier weather.   
  
Now at least we know that summer is the time to see Budapest and we are so excited to be able to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary this  August at the gorgeous palace,  [Four Seasons Budapest](http://www.fourseasons.com/budapest/ "four seasons budapest"). That should be quite a bit different than our [celebration  in Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "celebration in Paris") last summer or even the [celebrating in Dubrovnik](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/romantic-night.html "celebrating").   
  
Where was your favorite place to celebrate an anniversary?

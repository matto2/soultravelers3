Mozart doing a little recital at the fun class she did with Dad in San Jose, California when she was five last spring. Her teacher from China taught a thorough keyboard-based method that included singing, solfege, rhythm, ear training, sight reading, music theory, music history and composition. Here  
she chose to play “Old Blue” and “Sunbeams” in  May 2006. Her passion is composition/ improvisation, so we have switched to a great jazz piano teacher who teaches world wide over the internet.

Beautiful green [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "ireland") is a fabulous place to hike and bike as a family and we loved doing lots of it during our long stay there. This photo was taken near [Blarney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/10/family-travel-photo-ireland-blarney-stone-castles-exploring-adventure-motorhome.html "Blarney family vacation"), but we also loved exploring  [Killarney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/family-travel-photo-ireland-st-patricks-day-killarney-ring-of-kerry-traditional-muckross-farms.html "Kilarney family vacation"), [Dingle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/01/family-travel-photo-ireland-dingle-fusia-red-flower-green-landscape.html "dingle family vacation"), [Rock of Cashel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-ireland-rock-of-cashel-st-pat.html "Rock of Cashel photo") and much more as we encircled and criss crossed the entire Emerald Isle.  
  
Exploring a country by foot or bike gives a deep and close-up appreciation like nothing else and is one of the great [joys of slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "joys of slow travel").  Because we [travel Europe by motorhome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "travel europe by motorhome"), we always have our bikes with us, so that is handy although I am sure renting them is also quite easy.  
  
Surprisingly, despite [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "traveling the world") to 43 countries on 5 continents these last 5 years, we have explored the world primarily by foot and then bikes and mass transit as our next most used. Our RV is mostly parked and used as our [home base in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-europe-plan-then-improvise.html "motorhome home base in europe"), [we take planes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/leaving-on-a-jet-plane-just-like-the-song-we-are-leaving-on-a-jet-plane-but-we.html "we take planes") only when needed and we have [rental homes usually during the winter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "rental homes during the winter").  
  
Walking, hiking, and [trekking](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html "trekking") allows us to [enjoy nature more](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/beautiful-butterfly-flowers-and-family-travel.html "enjoy water more") as well as keep to our $23/day per person budget! One warning though, Ireland in July and August is colder and rainier than Spain in deepest winter and the mass transit is the worst in Europe outside of Dublin.  
  
Have you done any hiking or biking in Ireland?

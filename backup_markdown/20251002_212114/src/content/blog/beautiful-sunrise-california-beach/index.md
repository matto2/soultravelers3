What a way to wake up and start your day! I know I just wrote about [gorgeous sunsets and sunrises](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/beautiful-sunrises-and-sunsets.html "gorgeous sunsets and sunrises"), but I couldn't resist sharing this one with you. My mother has an enchanting place surrounded by redwoods, near the beach and on a river and this is the view out the window when I wake up in the morning,  
  
"There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope." Williams  
  
I am still [working on healing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "working on healing") ( so less time for this blog as I am rarely online these days). I have much to tell , but little time to tell it.  
  
  I am very grateful to be  in a very good environment to rest, reflect, enjoy family and the beautiful, quirky place that is [Santa Cruz.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/homeaway-santa-cruz-beach-house-vacation-rental-review-best-family-friendly-lodging.html "santa cruz") Often I am in an outdoor pool when the sun sets and enjoy the colors and peace of that as well ( there are some squirrels dashing about in pine trees there that entertain me too and sometimes I stay until the moon and stars come out).  
  
Have a wonderful day and week! What made you smile or brought you greater peace today?

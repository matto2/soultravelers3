Who doesn't dream about an exciting [road trip across the USA](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "road trip across USA")? America is full of magical places and family [travel by car](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/road-trip-usa-best-of-the-west.html "road trip - travel by car") means skipping high air fares and having time to bond, creating awesome [travel memories](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/florida-family-vacation-fun.html "travel memories"). [Summer vacations](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/06/top-10-summer-vacations-for-family-travel-.html "top 10 summer vacations") and [road trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/camping-or-roadtrip/ "road trips") go together like peanut butter and jelly.

For many years we did [road trips in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "road trips Europe") that we loved, so will do more, and Mozart is one of the [most well-traveled kids in the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "Most well-traveled child in the world is singer Mozart"), but lately we've been focused on [her music](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/02/teen-mozart-singing-red-carpet-grammys.html "beautiful teen Mozart sings inspiring pop music") and showing her more of USA travel. Her teen years and [talents](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/01/buy-mozarts-song-youre-not-alone-on-itunes-googleplay-or-amazon-.html "Mozart sings You are not alone") are leading us in new directions and it is time for her to know her home country better.

 [Road trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "family road trip") are the best way to see this vast country, so we've now driven from California to the Eastern seashore, thus Mozart can be proud that she has seen her own country from sea to shining sea!

We've done plane trips to [Hawaii](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/family-travel-hawaii-learning-to-surf-in-kauai.html "Family travel Hawaii"), [Colorado](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/03/castle-marne-trip-advisors-1-bb-in-denver.html "best b&b in Denver"), [New York](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/09/mozarts-adventures-during-new-york-fashion-week.html "New York Fashion Week with Mozart"), [Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/florida-sun-winter-getaway.html "Florida getaway") and more, but we love the intimacy and adventure of [road trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/europe-road-trip-a-drive-through-france-provence-to-dordogne-via-photos-family-travel.html "Europe Road trip ").

We did an amazing [winter road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/winter-road-trip-americas-southwest-.html "winter road trip isa") first with stops in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "top 10 California destinations"), Nevada, the [Grand Canyon](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/grand-canyon-family-adventure.html "Grand Canyon family adventure"). [Santa Fe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/romantic-winter-getaway-santa-fe.html "santa fe travel"),  [Dallas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/dallas-luxury-resort-arriving-to-big-d-in-style.html "dallas Luxury ") and more. I even wrote about [how to stay healthy while traveling on a road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/06/how-to-stay-healthy-while-traveling-paleo-road-trip.html "How to stay healthy while traveling road trip style"), paleo style and driving on [historic Route 66](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/historic-route-66-.html "historic route 66")!

Mozart recently won a High Honors Award from Johns Hopkins University Gifted Program for scoring higher at 13 years old than 97% of high school seniors who take the SAT test and is in the highest group within their CTY gifted program ( higher than 2/3 in the program). Wow! Couldn't miss that High Honors Award Ceremony!

Thus that gave us another opportunity for a long road trip to pick up her award and attend the ceremony at the University of Richmond. We drove from Dallas across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia.

Highlights that I will write more about were stopping at Graceland, Asheville, and Nashville as well as crossing the vast Mississippi River and visiting the Great Smoky Mountains.

Mozart even did some world-wide  "live" concerts as we drove via [YouNow](https://www.younow.com/MozartST3 "singer Mozart on YouNow") on her iPhone!

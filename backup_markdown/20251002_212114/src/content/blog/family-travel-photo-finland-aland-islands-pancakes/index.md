Yum! Who knew one has to go all the way to Finland to discover the best pancakes in the world? These scrumptious and unique thick, square pancakes are [a specialty](http://www.scantours.com/HISTORY_OF_ALAND.htm) in the [Aland Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85land_Islands) of [Finland](http://www.visitfinland.com/w5/index.nsf/%28pages%29/index). We had them last summer and my mouth still waters at the thought of them. It is almost like a very moist cake made with rice or semolina and served with whipped cream and jam.

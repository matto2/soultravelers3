Where can you ski in the morning, [swim in the sea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/post-1.html "southern spain") that very afternoon and maybe visit a gorgeous [UNESCO World Heritage](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/314 "Unesco ") Site in between? There is only one place in the world and it is the [Sierra Nevada Ski Resort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_%28Spain%29 "sierra Nevada ski resort") in [Granada](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/grace-gratitude.html "granada spain") Province in [Andalusia, Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/post-1.html "andalusia spain").  
  
Not too many get to ski both Sierra Nevada Mountain ranges ( [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "California") and [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "spain costa del sol holiday tips")) by 8 years old,but Mozart is one of the lucky ones to have those bragging rights, thanks to our four [winters in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "winter in spain") as part of our [digital nomad lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomad lifestyle").  
  
We loved visiting the [Alhambra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/la-alhambra.html "Alhambra travel"), soaking in [arab baths](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/ahh-arab-baths-andalusia-spa-malaga-granada-benalmedena-massage-hotspringsthemal-water-roman.html "arab baths in Spain") after skiing and then heading home to the [warm Med sea beach](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/our-beach-and-s.html#more) after playing [ancient princess](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/ancient-princes.html "ancient princess alhambra") and ski bum.  
  
Alas, we didn't get to ski in China as we had planned recently,Â  as we just ran out of time, but we will be back and to Spain and California as well. Now that we have our winter gear with us in Penang, we'll have to find the closest place to fly into for a bit of skiing.  
  
Where are you skiing this year?

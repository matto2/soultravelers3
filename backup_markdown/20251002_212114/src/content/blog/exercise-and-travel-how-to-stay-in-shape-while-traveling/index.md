Can you stay in shape easily while [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling the world")? Absolutely! My beloved husband DaVinci is in the best shape he has ever been in and that is partly BECAUSE of our [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel lifestyle") these last 7 years.  He is one of the few almost 60 year old men that I know who has no belly fat, a full head of hair and on no medication what so ever.  
  
We believe in [travel health](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "travel health") and eating an [organic diet](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html#more "organic food and travel") while we travel as much as possible. One has to stay more concientious to keep up with [healthy food and travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html#more "healthy food and travel"), but it can be done even [cheaply in  Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/09/how-to-eat-heal.html "how to eat cheaply and healthy in Europe") and everywhere.  
  
Most of the places we stay on our [family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family world tour") have great exercise rooms ,saunas, pools etc. for free. I use them, but he doesn't care to very often. He gets his exercise the way most people who live long lives do ( as studies show), just by living an active life.  
  
Our travel lifestyle has us do a LOT more walking than we did at home and we really like that. We purposely do most of our travel at ground level...walking, hiking, biking, using mass transit. Even when we are [motorhoming Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/motorhoming-travels-in-europe-.html "motorhoming Europe"), we are mostly parked, so using these methods. Add backpacks and groceries and you've got some weight training added to the aerobics!

We could easily buy a motorcycle or car when based in Asia as many do and they are cheap, but we enjoy the cultural and exercise value of not having such. Yes, it is often harder, schlepping groceries and supplies this way, but there is something instrinsinctly enjoyable about this positive choice, like eating real organic food ( which also tends to take longer for prep and such). We very rarely eat street food or junk food.  
  
It is all part of our slow travel lifestyle that we find more enriching. We wound up using my Mom's car a lot while in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California") recently, and that was a good reminder of how much we don't want that life every day any more. DaVinci definitely felt his fitness level drop their even though he still tried to walk some.

This is a fun, upbeat aerobic video from Youtube that I use some times as a portable workout if needed. I play it a few times and add some moves and exercises on my own. I can even do this in our motorhome if we are stuck in the rain for a few days and Mozart enjoys it too. Often we all just dance around the house for fun.  
  
They say if you [sit less than three hours a day,](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2012/07/09/sedentary-behaviour-life-expectancy.html?cmp=rss "sit less than three hours a day for health") one lives two years longer, so we try to do this and we almost never watch television, but do watch movies as a treat usually on weekends. To prevent bloggers butt, I have been doing more standing up while online. It is hard to write like that, but it works for other online tasks.  
  
What do you do to stay fit when you travel?

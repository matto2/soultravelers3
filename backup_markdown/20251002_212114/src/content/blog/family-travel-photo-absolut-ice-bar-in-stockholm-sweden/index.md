On a warm, sunny summer day in [Stockholm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm), we donned fur-lined, futuristic parka-capes and entered an air locked double-doored tunnel that leads into the [Absolut Ice Bar's](http://www.nordicseahotel.se/en/The-hotel/Food-and-drink/Absolut-Icebar-Stockholm/)  magical igloo-like chamber that delighted our whole family! Who knew this was perfect family travel entertainment?

Everything inside is [made of ice](http://europeforvisitors.com/europe/countries/sweden/stockholm-ice-bar.htm) including walls, glasses, plates, chairs, tables and the bar itself. They even had a flat screen TV embedded in ice which tickled Mozart as she kept touching it's frozen surface. We all ordered plain OJ in our rock-of-ice glasses which we had to sip with our gloves on.  Mozart was the only child, but we came early so few people were there and she even played her violin!

The ice bar and all of it's frozen parts are rebuilt every six months. The 100% pure ice is harvested from the Torne River in northern Sweden near Finland, where the Ice Bar's management has operated the spectacular [Ice Hotel](http://www.icehotel.com/) in Jukkasjärvi since 1989. The frozen couches had reindeer hides on them for seating, a nice touch. We all found this visit exhilarating, fun and a bit like visiting another planet. Perfect summertime fun!

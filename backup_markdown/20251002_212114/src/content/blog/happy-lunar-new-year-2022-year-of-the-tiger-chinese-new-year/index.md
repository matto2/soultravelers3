We have been blessed to celebrate [Chinese New Year in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html), USA and many places around the world so it has special meaning to us because we raised our daughter [Heavenly Reyna](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com) as a [global citizen](https://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/qa-with-jeanne-dee-the-nomadic-family-traveler/?mtrref=undefined&gwh=6B8973A9992D2EE29F7408B5D0C75922&gwt=pay&assetType=PAYWALL "NYT interviews soultravelers 3 global nomad pioneers"), [digital nomad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) and trilingual, thus she is [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html) so we have all immersed in the culture! As we prepare to set off this spring for longterm [van life travel in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/01/americans-van-life-in-europe-2022.html#more), we welcome these memories that invigorate us for a new year and new decade of [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html)!

We really loved our years in Asia, [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/china/) and Penang immersing deeply into the culture and really got to see [spectacular Lunar New Year celebrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwbU_OGfSQg)! We even celebrated Chinese New Year via [3 Generations travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html) when "grandma" at 83 traveled from California to live with us for 6 weeks in Asia.

And much to our surprise, both were interviewed for Chinese Television stations while we were celebrating and they were delighted and surprised at Heavenly's  fluent Mandarin!

At 13 she sang in Mandarin in Dallas Chinatown and we started going to Lunar New Year celebrations in  Santa Cruz area in her early childhood ( as she started learning Mandarin as baby. even in the womb).

And of course we have loved visiting [Chinatown in Los Angeles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2019/02/exploring-china-town-los-angeles-chinese-new-year-.html) in her teenage years! Heavenly just released her "winter wishes" trilingual holiday EP in November honoring the many cultures that she grew up in around the world. I love hearing her sing in Mandarin and Spanish as well as English! She has inspired me to start learning Spanish!

We are grateful that we all got to experience this fun way to celebrate the new year and knowing more about Chinese culture through these places and having a child who speaks the language.  
  
 Wishing all of you happy Lunar New Year and Spring Festival welcoming in wonderful, healing new energy for all in this year of the Tiger!!

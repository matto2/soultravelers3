Having a child, changes your life forever and in our case, that has certainly been the truth and what a wild ride it has been [all around the world.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family traveling all around the world") Since Mozart turned 13 it has been particularly full of constant change and leading us into new horizons we never really expected.  
  
While many of you were enjoying a relaxing Labor Day Weekend, we made a quick move into a new "home". Luckily, as a [minimalist family,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family") we don't take long [to pack](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/top-travel-tip-for-long-term-travel.html "Packing secrets"), but our challenge this time, was furniture as the best deals in Dallas come without furniture.  
  
In many ways, America is the most foreign country to us, especially in a state we do not know....yet, some how familiar too. We feel a bit like aliens who have returned to a once familiar planet.

We thought about pulling our treasures out of storage ( a few antiques, my heirloom chairs, organic King bed etc etc that we do sometimes miss), but it didn't make much sense to haul them all the way to Texas when we won't be here too long.  
  
So we did a minimalist Ikea haul in a few hours to furnish our new 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom condo on an exceedingly low budget.It feels like a mansion after living the last 7 months in one hotel room suite.

Ch,ch,change is in the air and we are figuring it out as we go...always based on Mozart's needs. We will still continue to travel, but need to base in Dallas for the next year, as Mozart has gotten into a Masters Class for singing/songwriting/musicianship/performance here. She can also take communtiy college courses here and focus on her passions as she world schools.  
  
![love this view...not to mention the pool and jacuzzi](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6d85bc7970b.png)  
  
We love the peaceful vibe here and our windows all look out to the pool and trees so it feels very remote, yet we are close to everything, including walking distance to Whole Foods.

What a thrill to have a big kitchen again! Mozart and I both like to cook, bake and ferment etc and this place even has a regular oven AND a Confectionery oven! Oh and a washer/dryer utility room that we have greatly missed. I'll likely mostly use just the washer and hang to dry on our terrace ( looking forward to planting things there too!).

Who knew one of Mozart's world school activities this week would be putting furniture together!

She is thrilled to have her own bedroom again and she placed her keyboard at an angle at these two windows to inspire her song writing. What a sweet view to wake up to and do creative work to. There is room for her desk too, a huge closet and her own bathroom. She is already planning a sleepover!  
  
A joy to her parents too, that we can shut the door when she is doing her music. Not that we don't love it, but 3 people trying to write, work, make phone calls and do music all at the same time in one small room for 7 months, taught us great patience and more flexibility. ( We actually had more space in the small RV in Europe,Â  because we used much of the outdoors as our personal space).  
  
Our great life ( like any life) doesn't escape compromises and sacrifice.  
  
  
![my Ikea table](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6d85bf8970b.png)  
  
One of the greatest simple pleasures is having a table again, as we are the type of family that likes to sit down together at meals, say Grace, savor the food and enjoy the connecting conversations. We'll even be able to have meals with a this wrap around fire place this winter which will be cozy.

This is a photo of our first meal in our new home. I tried to take a selfie of the three of us, but it didn't turn out and we were too hungry to take any more.  
  
It's been pretty intense, finding a place, making decisions, while also setting Mozart up in classes and planning a trip to NYC for Fashion Week as Mozart has been asked to be the youngest backstage reporter. We had to have the miniest celebrations for our 23 wedding anniversary and 9 year travel/location independent anniversary as time is flying by too fast.  
  
Long days, aching muscles, constant intense decision making, a dash of chaos and upheaval, endless adaptability....but somehow it all seems to be working out perfectly and we are learning even more lessons on trusting and loving every moment.  
  
How about you? Is this a transition time period, or just us?

Wow, I loved this beautiful bird that was just sitting at the dock as I walked by in Key Largo, Florida when we stopped there to swim with dolphins. [Bird watching is a popular activity in the Florida Keys](http://www.floridakeysbest.com/audubon/birding_florida_keys.htm "bird watching florida keys") as it is one of the top destinations in the world for bird fans and we can see why.  
  
[Learning about animals](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/elephant-seals-at-ano-nuevo-world-school-fieldtrip.html "learning about animals travel ano nuevo field trip") as we [travel the world as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "travel the world as a family") is one of the many ways we use our [travel as education.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/learning-while-traveling-travel-homeschool-road-school-abroad-5-best-reasons.html "travel as education") We were at [Dolphin Plus](http://www.dolphinsplus.com/ "Dolphin Plus swim with dolphins") to swim with dolphins as we [did in Portugal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DwI5p8a3UM "swim with dolphins portugal"), which was an amazing experience in itself but the birds also reminded us of the exciting [bird sanctuaries we visited in France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html  "bird sanctuary in France camargue") and one in [Portugal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/celebrating-in.html "Portugal algarve bird sanctuary").  
  
Birds are very much a special part of our [round-the -world family trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "round the world family trip") and give us much joy, like every morning here where they wake us with the beautiful dawn over the Andaman sea as they did in Spain at the Meditterainian sea. [In Tuscany](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/tuscany-camping.html "Tuscany travel wtih kids camping"), babies in a nest charmed us, the [birds overwhelmed us in San Marcos in Venice](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/piazza-san-marc.html "birds st marcos venice") and awed us in France's famous theme park [Puy du Fou](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/family-travel-photofrance-puy-du-fou-theme-park-1.html "Puy du fou") as they did in the UK shows.  
  
Do you love birds too? How do they impact your every day life or travel life?

Unlike much of Asia, like neighboring Thailand or even other parts of Malaysia that have major monsoon seasons,  [Penan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang, Malaysia")g does not have a real rainy season. We were here last year from [November through May](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang winter rental") and so far this year, we've been here from [February through September](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "renting an apartment in Penang") and find it mostly sunny, most of the time.  
  
Of course, that doesn't mean there is no rain or no clouds, as we get some of both. I have never seen it rain all day. The tropical storms here tend to come up quick and disappear quickly. Most of the time, the rain seems to happen at sunset or the evening and sometimes there are wonderful lightning storms to enjoy, usually at night.  
  
Once in a while the rain pours so hard that even my child's [Mandarin school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin school") gets a little flooded which she loves as the kids run around the campus barefoot then with squeals of delight. The rhythm of a bit-of -rain regularly is just part of life here, like the tropical sun.  
  
There seems to be a little more rain in the fall and it is not totally unusual during this time to have rain, sun, rain, sun  pattern all day. Mostly, though, the rain doesn't last long. We tend to do like the locals and always have an umbrella with us as it is handy both for sun and rain. In between the bit of rain days, there are sunny days..one just can't predict a pattern, especially in the autumn. I try to get my [Vitamin D from the sun](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/sun-for-its-health-benefits-.html "getting Vitamin D from the sun for health"), so sometimes tricky with that, but still easier than most places.  
  
I don't like the rain in [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "travel Europe by camper van"), because it often seems endless and it adds cold and dreariness ( and why we [winter in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "winter in Spain")).  It can go on all day for days. Here I enjoy the rain usually, because it adds a bit of excitement as the wind whips up suddenly, or a black cloud quickly dumps a deluge out of no where, then almost as quickly, the sun returns. It cools things down and refreshes the air and adds variety to tropical living.  
  
How about you? Are you a rain person or not? Or does it depend on where the rain is?

GO! When you are a global kid  
who has been traveling the world

OH! THE PLACES YOU WILL GO! When you are a [global kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "global kid") who has been [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling the world long term as a family digital nomad") non-stop for 7 years to 44 countries on 5 continents, [playing violin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "playing violin around the world kid") and [piano as you roam](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/12/pool-play-piano.html "piano and travel"), [learning Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "American kid learning Mandarin in Asia") and [Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "American kid in school in Spain") like a native...sometimes you need a little "show and tell" to help your [best friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/best-friends-forever-and-travel-.html "best friends around the world") understand your [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel lifestyle").  
  
Mozart uses lots of the photos from the blog when she is emailing [friends in other parts of the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "best friends around the world"), as it's a quick way for her to grab them and explain, like her [recent birthday party](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/global-travel-tween-ultimate-birthday-party-in-asia.html "birthday party in asia"). Sometimes when the [Chinese students](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/american-student-chinese-view.html "American student chinese view")  at her school are perplexed about her unusual life like [playing violin in the Sahara at 6](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/sahara-dream.html "6 year old volunteering in Africa") or [](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/-6-month-european-family-road-trip-09.html "swimming with dolphins")[sailing on the Turquoise Coas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/sailing-away.html)t in Turkey or [climbing up Tiger's Nest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html "tigers nest bhutan  vacation") in Bhutan or whatever, she has the photos to help them grasp the reality. She can even introduce different [friends from around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "friends around the world how-to") to each other.  
  
Luckily, we not only have many popular videos on [Youtube about our travels](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3?gl=HK&hl=zh-HK "Youtube soultravelers3 about travel"), but she has also been on TV quite a few times on [our world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "our world trip"), much to our surprise. She was on a [Japanese show while in Croatia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/mozarts-film-de.html "Japanese show croatia"), on [BBC around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/bbc-world-news-featured-soultravelers3-youtube-viral-travel-video-fast-track-bbcnews.html "soultravelers3 on BBC about world trip") once and then [interviewed by BBC](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "BBC interviews soultravelers3 on social media and travel") another time, on TV in Hong Kong and China [with her Grandmother](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "travel with grandmother") and on [FOX TV in the USA](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/soultravelers3-digital-nomad-family-on-fox-tv-.html "soultravelers3 on fox TV"). So these videos are another way for her to share some of her life experiences with friends.  
  
We originally started the blog to keep a record for her and stay in touch with family, but we never knew it would be like this, inspire others,  and a handy tool for her as well in many ways. It was really a different world when we were planning this trip in 2004, but it's turned out better than we expected. A [nomadic lifestyle with children](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/nomadic-lifestyle-with-children-.html "nomadic lifestyle with children - extended world travel") can have many surprises along the way!  
  
OH!  
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!  
  
You'll be on your way up!  
You'll be seeing great sights!  
You'll join the high fliers  
who soar to high heights.

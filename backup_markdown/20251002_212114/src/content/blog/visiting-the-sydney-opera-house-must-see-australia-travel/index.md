When you travel to Australia,  a must-see for sure is to visit the stunning  world- famous Sydney Opera House. Sydney is outrageously expensive, but so beautiful on a sunny day that it was still one of our favorite cities on our 7 year non-stop [family world tour.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "family world tour - nomadic with kids")  I must write more about our time Down Under as we enjoyed the gregarious Aussie perspective and had lots of adventures.  
  
The architecture of the Sydney Opera House is unique and exquisite and also makes it  a UNESCO World Heritage site. We stayed nearby in the historic and posh  ["The Rocks"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/the-stunning-sydney-harbour-yha-hostel-review.html "hostel in The Rocks sydney")  area of Sydney, so enjoyed leisurely walks to the Opera House during the day, at sunset and in the evenings after the show..which was buzzing at the waterfront bars nearby. This was the view from our hostel at dusk.  
  
One of the many ways that we use [travel to educate](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "travel to educate") our child is seeing performances around the world, so we couldn't miss a show in this venue. Both the Sydney Symphany Orchestra and Australian Ballet perform regularly and we were happy to catch a very thoughtful modern ballet performance.  
  
Have you ever seen a show at the Sydney Opera House or is it on your bucket list?

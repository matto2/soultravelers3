Can you travel as a lifestyle  
and still have best friends  
forever and long term friends?

Can you [travel as a lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel as a lifestyle") and still have best friends forever and long term friends? Yes, after 7 years of [travel as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "world travel as a family") on 5 continents to 44 countries so far, I can say amazing long term friends in three languages around the world has been one of the greatest benefits. A [nomadic lifestyle with children](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/nomadic-lifestyle-with-children-.html "nomadic lifestyle with children") can be rewarding on so many levels.

I have a very social child, so I wasn't sure how this would work out when we started our location independent travel life in 2005 and started our non-stop world trip as a family in 2006. I've written about our experiences in [Can Globe Trotting Kids Have Friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "Can globe trotting kids have friends") as well as giving more tips on  [Kids, Friends, Travel on the Ultimate Family Adventure.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "kids, friends and travel on ultimate family adventure")  
  
Her long term friendships are important to us, so along with her [education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "homeschool through travel ") and our family bonding fun, we've designed our travel so she could have these long term close friends as well as the many casual friends that we meet for shorter time periods on our travels.

I loved this doodle in my 11 year old's notebook from [Best Friends Around the World - Traveling with School Age Kids.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "best friends around the world traveling with a school age child") Too cute how she unconsciously used her three languages in the description..using the [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Mandarin school in asia") word for friends and [Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "school in spain") word for world. Thanks to lots of [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") and a little dipping into [local schools](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "how to go to local school in Asia for Mandarin") combined with our [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschool and travel"), it helps her think like a [global citizen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "global citizen") in more than one mother tongue.  
  
![time to fix each others hair on a sleep over in Asia at our house](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d3c92daf7970c.jpg)  
  
The top photo is of her with an old friend from [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "california travel") that lives in southern California, so she doesn't see her too often, but they've always had a great connection starting in babyhood. We've got photos and home movies of them together as babies, toddlers, preschoolers and young school age before we left. I wasn't sure what would happen with this meeting, but it was as if they had never been apart.  
  
Her best friend in Asia, she met on her very first day at her [Chinese High School](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Only American in Chinese high school") when everyone was staring at her as they had never seen an American or Caucasian at the school before. This Chinese Malaysian girlfriend had spent many years in London, so probably had a lot of empathy and gave her good advice. They've been best friends ever since and don't miss an opportunity for a sleep over, movie, mall date or get together after school as they are not in the same grade.  
  
She has a large group of friends here in Asia and really enjoys them all. Mozart is out going by nature, but I think our travel lifestyle has made her even better at making friends easily with all kinds of people. Most of the people on her BFF list, she has known for many years or most of her life, thus able to spend lots of quality time together building and reconnecting over many years, despite having some time apart.

The only bad thing about having many homes [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "around the world family travel"), is we always have some one dear to miss. As we enjoy our friends in Asia now, we miss our friends in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "Barcelona"), [Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/family-travel-spain-photo-andalusia.html "Andalusia"), London, [Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/international-kids-water-fun-european-style.html "swedish friends camping together")  and [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "California"), but tech helps us keep in touch. Not only do we get to talk via webcam or facebook with our dearl friends in Barcelona, but we also get to hear this little dog that we all love. It's good to giggle together even at a distance!  
  
This past weekend we talked to our dear friends in London who we met when we [arrived in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-guests-in.html#more "winter in spain") as they were our first guests and treated us at their [home in Malaga](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/marvelous-meal.html "malaga meal"). Hard to believe the baby in diapers in those photos is now seven.

Time speeds by when you have kids. Soon they will all be old enough to fly in for longer visits perhaps. [Travel means good byes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/travel-means-goodbyes.html "travel means good byes") as well as hello to new adventure, but by doing long stays and returning regularly to places we love, we get to maintain long term friendships.

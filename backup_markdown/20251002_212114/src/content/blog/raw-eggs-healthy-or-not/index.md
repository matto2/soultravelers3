If you told me 2 years  
ago that we would be  
eating raw, pastured eggs daily

If you told me 2 years ago that we would be eating raw, pastured eggs daily ( we 60 year old [retirees](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retirees and travel"), our 12 year old child and my 85 year old mother), I never would have believed it, or the [health benefits.](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/02/why-does-this-commonly-vilified-food-actually-prevent-heart-disease-and-cancer.aspx "health benefits raw eggs") But learning to [travel while sick](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "travel while sick") on my [health journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "health journey"), I've learned a lot about [raw organic food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "raw organic food and travel") and what works for us.  
  
Are raw eggs healthy? Like most things, that depends on who you listen to, what eggs and how deep you research. I certainly bought into the status quo on this one and never looked deeper until [a doctor](http://www.candidaplan.com/ "Dr, Jeff McCombs") suggested that I eat raw egg yolks to help my mysterious illness. I must admit, I was a bit stunned and afraid at the thought of it..and even more so about doing it in [tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical Asia") in a developing country.

Now that we have been eating healthy, raw, pastured eggs from small farms in Asia for over a year ( and almost 6 months of organic pastured raw eggs in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "capitola, California") before that) I have much more confidence and see it's benefits in healing. I was totally debilitated, sick and in pain, before I began eating them and almost 100% healed now thanks to a few important diet changes like this.  
  
**DOCTORS AND HEALTH PROFESIONALS WHO EAT RAW EGGS**  
  
As I looked deeper into the issue, I discovered other MD's and health experts who had been eating raw eggs for years and praising the [benefits of raw eggs](http://www.naturalnews.com/022607_raw_foods_eggs.html "benefits of raw eggs"):  
  
"Raw egg yolk has been compared to human breast milk because it can be absorbed almost 100% without needing digestion. There is no need to limit number of egg yolks per day, as they absorb quickly almost without needing any digestion and will provide your patient with wonderful and most needed nutrition.  Get your eggs from a source you trust: fresh, free range and organic. Dr. Natasha Campbell McBride M.D. Neurologist, MaMedSci ( Nutrition) GAPS  
  
"So to be clear, my advice is that you can safely eat WHOLE raw eggs, from a healthy fresh source. Personally I eat four whole raw eggs each morning with my breakfast" Dr. Mercola D.O.  
" During coauthor Jordan Rubin's healing process, he consumed this smothie one to two times per day with raw eggs. ( Popular belief to the contrary, eggs from healthy free-range chickens are almost always free of pathogenic salmonella. However, before consuming raw eggs, it's best to thoroughly wash the shell with mild alcohol or hydrogen peroxide solution)." Dr. Joseph Brasco M.D. ( Restoring Your Digestive Health).  
  
" I have eaten up to 24 whole raw eggs daily for 28 years with no ill effects. Thousands of people have eaten up to 33 whole raw eggs daily for up to 25 years with none of the symptoms associated with biotin deficiency." Anjonus Vonderplanitz ( We Want to Live)  
  
"I eat raw eggs but lots of people are scared to do it because of infectious disease and biotin deficiency issues. I am not because my diet is very balanced and I have no AI diseases." Dr. Jack Kruse M.D. Neurologist

**RAW EGG - RISKY OR SUPERFOOD?**  
  
Raw eggs are eaten on a daily basis in Japan and they are considered one of the healthiest nations.  
Egg yolks are one of the rare foods that contain  high levels of vitamin D, which supports the immune system and more important than vitamin C!Like most people, the fear of salmonella poisoning was drilled into me over the years via the media, ( and nursing school), but reading more deeply into that gave me a deeper understanding of the true risks.  
  
ANYTHING  we put into our mouths, even by things we touch like keyboards, kitchen sinks, ( 2 of the most dangerous) etc. is a risk, just like every time we get into our car or on a plane, but one must think more in terms of calculated risks when making decisions. Keeping ones immune system strong is the best defense.   
  
"Raw eggs are one of the best compact foods in nature. Eggs are the ultimate, complete fast food. However the protein in eggs is not utilized for cellular reproduction. They are utilized for regeneration and maintenance. The relationship between raw eggs and salmonella poisoning is a myth" _(The great egg panic by Emily Green, LA R times Jan 2000)_  
  

"There’s absolutely no reason to limit your consumption of eggs to three to four per week, as recommended by “heart-healthy” nutritional guidelines. In fact, consuming two to three eggs per day would provide a better boost to your health and protection against disease than a multivitamin supplement. Eggs truly are one of nature’s superfoods.

It’s important, however, to make sure that you buy organic, pasture-raised eggs. Studies show that commercially-raised eggs are up to 19 times higher in pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids. Unfortunately, almost all eggs sold in supermarkets – even the organic eggs sold at chains such as Whole Foods and Wild Oats – are not truly pasture-raised." Chris Kresser L.AC  
  
  
**"The well-circulated salmonella risk, which isn’t the dire prospect it’s often made out to be**.  Of course, [not all eggs are created equal](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/egg-purchasing-guide/ "Egg Purchasing Guide") when it comes to salmonella or nutrition. Not only are organic, free range eggs more nutrient-dense, one study found them to be [significantly less contaminated than battery cage hens](http://www.worldpoultry.net/news/salmonella-levels-in-poultry-higher-in-battery-eggs-id2162.html " Salmonella levels in poultry higher in battery eggs"). Hens that graze and eat a natural diet as well as have more space to roam (to avoid living in feces) are naturally healthier." Mark Sisson  
  

  _![pastured eggs in a bowl](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee80ef0b4970d.jpg)_ **HOW RISKY IS SALMONELLA IN RAW EGGS?**  
  
 In truth, only 0.003% ([1 in 30,000](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12022671?dopt=Abstract "An overview of the Salmonella enteritidis risk assessment for shell eggs and egg products.")) eggs are actually contaminated with salmonella, **BUT** the risk is even less if the eggs you are consuming are free range, pastured eggs.  
  
If you live in the USA, you have 1 in 100 chance of dying in a motor vehicle accident, a 1 in 1000 chance of dying by accidental drowning and a 1 in 20,000 chance of dying in a plane crash. So you are much more at risk driving to work every day or taking a bath/swimming and even taking a plane.  
  
Even if you should get a 1 in 30,000 salmonella infected egg ( which is almost impossible in the home environment and almost always occurs in institutions like hosptials or restaurants), if you are relatively healthy, you would at most get a flu-like illness for 2 or 3 days, then feel fine and be fully recovered.  
  
Salmonella is a very common pathogen found almost everywhere, and it is more likely, to multiply on cooked food that you keep in your refridgerator or via your pet. Typically Salmonella is a self-limited condition and takes care of itself. You don't need treatment or antibiotics or to be hospitalized.  
  
It is more of a risk for babies and the elderly, so I did consider this fact when I recommended pastured organic raw eggs and organic, pastured raw milk to my 85 year old mother, but she is healthy and it's super nutrition to help her osteoporosis, so her progressive  M.D. also thought it was an excellent idea.  
  
Interestingly, Vonderplanitz documents a case in his book about  an almost dying 80 year old, who had a miraculous recovery just by eating raw eggs.

**HEALTH BENEFITS OF RAW EGGS** - **A SUPERFOOD!**  
 There are reasons why atheletes and bodybuilders, just like that Rocky movie scene, like to eat raw eggs. I've learned to eat them like that, but prefer them in a raw milk eggnog or [raw milk kefir](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "raw milk kefir") smoothie like I give to my family. I also love poached or soft boiled ( best ways to cook them if you must) and my husband likes sunny side up with liquid yokes for more nutrition as heating kills some of the advantages.  
  
Eggs  provide you with:  
  
The most essential amino acids like Tryptophan and Tyrosine ( providing prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer), many vitamins (B1, B2, B6, B12, A, D, biotin), essential fatty acids, zinc magnesium and numerous other nutrients.  
  
\* Improves brain and nervous system function  
\* Burns fat  
\* Gives the body more energy  
\* Supports the immune system  
\* Improves circulation  
\* Improves glandular function  
\* Improves homone balance  
\* Speeds up metabolism  
  
   
Eggs from pastured chickens ( compared to commericial USDA eggs) contained:  
  
\* 1⁄3 less cholesterol  
\*  1⁄4 less saturated fat  
\*  2⁄3 more vitamin A  
\*  2 times more omega-3 fatty acids  
•  3 times more vitamin E  
• 7 times more beta carotene  
  
For those who have bought into the [Cholesterol myths](http://www.ravnskov.nu/cholesterol.htm "chloresterol myths"), check out that link ( by M.D. PhD) as well as any books by Gary Taubes or Mary G. Enig PhD who explain the science well backed by studies

We get 50 eggs one or two times a week from the farmers market here ( gathered from small farms of free range organic eggs..or so they say as I haven't been to them yet) or from the [organic stores in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/where-to-buy-organic-food-in-penang.html "organic food stores  in Penang"). We eat most of them raw daily in smoothies that combine things like organic raw milk or coconut  kefir, tumeric, organic prunes, organic raw unheated honey, banana, organic cinnamon and organic goji berries to the eggs. LOTS of antioxidants!  
  
![eggs in asia come in 10's not dozen and we recycle/reuse containers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee8107929970d.jpg)  
  
  
I can get wonderful pastured chickens from DQ and now can find delicious fresh raw goats milk from [Happy Goat Farm](http://www.happygoats.com.my/ "happy goat farm penang fresh milk"), but I have yet to find pastured grass fed beef, so eggs are an important protein source for us.  
  
I buy them fresh ( most eggs in USA stores are at least 3 weeks old), and refrigerate them, but first I wash them and soak them in either peroxide and water or GSE in water. I also always use a bit of organic cold pressed coconut oil with them as an added protection as it is  naturally  antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial.  
  
![peroxide and or GSE for soaking eggs](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c366bc5ea970b.jpg)  
  
Each person, must decide on their own diets and risks, but for us, this seems to really work. Any questions?

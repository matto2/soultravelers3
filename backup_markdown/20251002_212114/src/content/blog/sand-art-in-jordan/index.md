One of the joys of [family travel in Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "family travel in Jordan") is deciding what to bring home to be a reminder of this special place. Our daughter just loved the sand art in Jordan, so of course we had to buy one as a souvenir.  
  
She bought one in a teeny tiny bottle in Petra after watching them make some.Â  They really are fascinating, creative and beautiful. They say this craft began in [Petra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "Petra vacation") in the 1920's or earlier inspired by the many colorful shades of rock there.  
  
  
Do you like to watch local craft makers like we do when you travel?

**KEYS FOR LONG TERM TRAVEL**  
  
Remember [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel tips")  is key to [prevent travel burn out](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/how-to-prevent-travel-burnout.html "prevents travel burn out"), [traveling Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best european family vacations") in [an RV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "camping europe in a motorhome or rv or campervan") rocks, [homeschool and travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschool and travel") are a great mix, r[aising global kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "raising global kids") means they will have amazing opportunities especially if they [grow up bilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html "growing up bilingual") or [trilingual or more.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "how to raise a multilingual child")  
  
One of our best accomplishments on this world trip (being monolingual parents) was  managing to [raise a trilingual kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raising-a-bilingual-child-or-trilingual.html "raising a bilingual or trilingual child") who is [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/fluent-mandarin.html "fluent in mandarin") and [learned fluent Spanish in Spai](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning spanish in spain")n.

**MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BRING WITH YOU ON A WORLD TOUR**  
  
We travel really light with just a carry-on bag each as we [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "travel the world with kids"), so we are definitely a [minimalist family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family"), but I think we have our priorities straight on what is important. That might be one of the best lessons from travel.  
  
One of the smartest things we did before leaving was create a "family home movie" dvd and scanned tons of priceless family photos from tons of albums onto a digital format. (We actually forgot to do this until the last moment, so had to retreive boxes from a distance to complete.) It's been fabulous for us, but also for sharing with our new friends as we roam the world.

**KEEPING ROOTS WITH A TRAVEL LIFESTYLE**  
  
I think home movies are the number one  thing we are happiest about that we brought wtih us on our [world tour.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/around-the-world-with-kids-extended-travel-long-term-travel-families-and-friends.html "family world trip with kids") We had some with us from the start, but got a whole bunch more when we were last in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "top california destinations"), so really loving them. So fun for kiddo too to see herself as a newborn or toddler etc.. We've been [on TV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/how-to-get-on-tv.html "how to get on tv") repeatedly  too, so add that to our collection.  
  
![Long term family travel = taking home movies along](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901e2cb399970b.jpg)  
  
Didn't you love family nights as a kid watching "home movies"? I did and Mozart does too, plus it has added value when you're doing extended travel as it helps a child stay connected to his/her home culture, past, roots and relatives in addition to maintaining family rituals in foreign lands.  
  
![Long term family travel, sharing home movies with new friends around the world](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301910422b935970c.jpg)  
  
  
We also have home movies of me as a young child and my family, so that is great to share too and lets her also see **four of her great grandparents** and most of her relatives...even ones that have passed on now. Plus, I suppose, a little history lesson on what growing up in the 50's looked like.  
  
I owe these wonderful recent videos to my sweet sister who had the right equipment to allow us to put them all on DVD. So I suppose it is especially rewarding as we did not see these at all for 6 years. Recently she had to relearn some baby Spanish songs for her new first job at 12  teaching Spanish to little ones here, so it was wonderful to discover her at 18 months happily singing these same songs.  
  
![Extended travel as a family - playing with dolphins in Key West](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330192abebd4b7970d.jpg)  
  
But the ones we had were so important to a young kid to know her extended family as we roam the world. We have video of my brother who died at 40 long before she was born and her Grandmother on her Dad's side who died before she was born. This allows her to have a relationship and connection with them and even today she has a photo of both her grandma's on her bedroom mirror along with more photos of family and friends around the world.  
  
One of the great ones we had/have with us was a family wedding with all the cousins and extended family and the [rituals of Xma](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/home-for-the-holidays.html "home for the holidays")s and [Thanksgiving](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/thanksgiving-blessings-in-spain-.html "Thanksgiving abroad") at the home of both sides of the family. This way...even though many now have passed like [both](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/what-i-learned-from-my-father.html "what I learned from my dad") [Dads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/good-bye-dad-grandpa-family-death-afar-while-traveling-abroad.html "dads dying") and a beloved [step Dad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html "mourning while traveling") and [great uncles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/good-bye-uncle.html "great uncle"), she has them in her memory banks.  
  
![A global kid at home in the world and multilingual](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901e2ca118970b.jpg)  
  
Since she lived in the same home for the first 5 years of her life and during my pregnancy...which we have well documented...she also has a strong sense of home and family and roots...to mix with the world travel .

When we [celebrate holidays abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "celebrate christmas abroad "), especially ones that no one else is celebrating like [Thankgiving](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/first-thanksgiving-in-asia.html "Thanksgiving in Asia") or 4th of July, we can connect with our family rituals from past holidays to make the day special. Our blog and [Soultravelers Youtube channe](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 youtube channel")l and video not up yet, add to the fun.  
  
We ate pizza here on the 4th and celebrated in Asia at Sea World in San Diego, Roaring Camp jumping frogs in Santa Cruz, Conference in LA, Lake Arrowhead family camp, Disneyland, horseback riding at Windermere in Santa Barbara etc etc....by watching home movies of past celebrations!  
  
![Traveling the world as a family rocks!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301910422db29970c.jpg)  
  
Sometimes [travel nomads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/digital-nomad-global-kid-tv-stories.html "travel nomads") just bring their home country celebrations along with them as they see the world. For a family especially, I think long term travel and home videos are a killer combo!  
  
Do you love home movies too? What is your must have item for long term travel?

Mozart was very happy to see some of her favorite paintings in the Uffitzi Gallery in Florence! The spectacular Uffizi is the primary art museum of Florence and one of the world’s oldest museums. It is one of the most famous museums of paintings and sculptures in the world and was begun by the Medici family during the Renaissance.

It is the only place that we ran into crowds in Florence this late in the season (late October), but one can not visit this city without seeing this jewel which houses the finest collection of Italian Renaissance paintings in existence.

Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus” and “Primavera” are two of Mozart’s favorite paintings of all times, so that was pretty thrilling for her to see them in person and she was surprised that they were so big. Every room is filled with masterpieces from the likes of DaVinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Raphael  & more and together they chart the development of the Renaissance, almost decade by decade.

I am so happy that Mozart is getting to see so many great works of art as we travel as they are so much more impressive in person. One thinks of the young Michaelangelo and how he grew up around this incredible art and how that must have impacted his life.

Obviously, my pictures will never do justice to the beauty we saw all day long. Here is the site for virtual Uffizi if any of you are studying along with us or would like to know more: [http://www.virtualuffizi.com/uffizi/index.htm](http://www.virtualuffizi.com/uffizi/index.htm) I even loved the ceilings, building and views outside. We got to watch a woman do restorative work to one of the ceilings which was interesting.

We also really enjoyed an (expensive!) snack and hot chocolate at the Uffizi Gallery cafe just before it closed with its beautiful views of the Duomo and Capanile. When we left it was dark and we watched two young violinist street performers before we headed to another great Italian meal.

For those just coming to the blog, we we were in Florence in late October and I am still in the process of getting up to date with our journey this year, as we are now wintering in Southern Spain until the spring. Italy was our last stop before settling down in an apartment for the holidays and winter in one of the warmest places in Europe. I have been blogging for 16 months of travel, so I am posting slower now as I handle other areas, although hopefully I will catch up soon  
to real time.

The glitzy [Italian Riviera](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/7-best-reasons-to-travel-cinque-terre-italy.html "Italian riviera") is one of the most stunning and picturesque places in the world and long been a luxury playground for the rich and famous. Just look at that azure water, verdant hills and magnificent mansions on a sunny summer day in Italy's exclusive Liguurian coast. Ahhhh, [Portofino](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photo-italy.html "Portofino")!  
  
But how can a budget traveler enjoy such pleasures and luxury on a tiny budget? Easy! Yes, just like [bargain Bora Bor](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "bargain bora bora")a and [cheap Norway,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/norway-budget-travel.html "cheap Norway travel") we found ways to luxuriate in this divine spot, whilst staying on our $23/day per person budget on our [long term family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "long term family world trip").  
  
**BEST TIPS FOR ITALIAN RIVIERA LUXURY ON A SMALL BUDGET**  
  
1) YOU DON'T NEED TO STAY IN A 5 STAR HOTEL TO ENJOY THE LUXURY  
  
This photo was taken in [Portofino](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-italy-portofino-family-friendly-attractions-on-italian-riviera.html "portofino") which is a tiny fishing village turned tre chic with only 500 permanent residents, thus it doesn't take long to tour it. Most of the towns on the Italian Riviera are close together and easily accessible by train and/or bus.  
  
2) DO DAY TRIPS AND SLOW TRAVEL  
  
[Slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") often means picking a comfortable base and doing day trips from it. That is really easy to do in the Italian coast if you [go Italian style](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/italian-style.html "go Italian style") like the locals.  
  
3) LODGE WITH THE LOCALS ON THE ITALIANÂ  RIVIERA  
  
This super [budget lodging in Cinque Terr](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/cinque-terra-gem-best-budget-lodging-italy-for-family-vacation.html "budget lodging cinque terra gem on Italian riviera")e was filled with Italian families, so not only was it cheap, comfy and very convenient, but we got to know the locals who live nearby and spend their summers here. You can [travel Europe with a camper van](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "travel Europe with a camper van") as we do, or book a cottage for a week, or [camp Europe with a tent](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/big-tent-camping-in-europe-glamping-european-style-frugal-minimalist-luxury-backpacking-flashpacking.html "camping Europe with a tent") if you plan a [European style road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/rv-in-europe-road-trip-europe-camping-european-style.html "Eurpean style road trip").  
  
  
4) TAKE A BUS OR TRAIN INSTEAD OF A CRUISE SHIP  
  
Why be at the mercy of a cruise ship schedule and super high costs to travel with masses of people? Do day trips by bus or train from your comfy base and do things on YOUR timing. We've learned [how to travel without crowds in high season](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html "how to travel without crowds in hgh season"), partly by avoiding cruise ships and their days in port.  
  
5) ENJOY ALL THE FREE THINGS  
  
There are so many things that you can do for free...hike, hang out at the glorious beaches, [explore boutiques](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/souvenirs-what-do-you-buy-.html "explore boutiques") and art galleries, visit historic spots or just wander about the enchanted streets and harbors.  
  
6) SPLURGE ON LITTLE LUXURIES TO FEEL LIKE A QUEEN OR KING  
  
Because you are saving so much money by traveling smart, you can also allow yourself little luxuries like dinner ( or better yet lunch) in a fancy place or after a picnic lunch, splurging on gelato or dessert in the fanciest of places.  
  
  
**DON'T MISS THE ITALIAN RIVIERA**  
  
So now that you know you don't have to be rich to travel richly, when are you headed to the Italian Riviera? If it is not on your bucket list, it should be!

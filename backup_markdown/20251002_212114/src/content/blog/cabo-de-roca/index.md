Mozart was thrilled to get an official sealed certificate from Cabo de Roca, Portugal the furthest western point in Europe! I thinkÂ  there is a little competition with [Spain's Finistere](http://www.bootsnall.com/articles/06-09/finisterre-or-the-end-of-the-world-finisterre-galicia-spain.html) which is a famous place with the same claim. If my understanding is correct, I think [Cabo de Roca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_da_Roca) is the furthest, but [Finistere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Finisterre) was thought to be the furthest point and called the "end of the earth" by Europeans for many years in history. Perhaps [Cabo de Roca](http://www.lanternroom.com/lighthouses/portugal/port07.htm) was discovered later when better measurements were possible.

Don't you just love the sound of that name? We kept finding excuses to say it as we drove there. It has a romantic ring to it and slides off the tongue in a joyful way. It is kind of out in the middle of no where, but worth the drive, plus it was on our way north. It was a place for beautiful cliffs, sparkling blue water, abundant wildflowers and bird watching.

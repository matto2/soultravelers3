YUM! Did you know Key West was famous for it's pink shrimp? I know, we've all heard about the famous sunset in Key West, it's a [perfect spot for a winter vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/key-west-vacation.html "Key west winter vacation spot"), and the southern most city in continental USA, but the shrimp was new to us and we loved it!  
  
This was part of our [beach bliss](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-beach-bliss-romantic-dining-fantasy-in-key-west.html "Beach bliss key west ") meal right on the water at historic [Casa Marina Resort](http://www.casamarinaresort.com/ "casa marina resort") on our amazing [road trip through Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "amazing road trip florida") from the Keys to [Pensacola](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/florida-family-vacation-fun.html "vacation in pensacola, florida"). I still have so much to tell about that fun filled journey, but this will have to do for now on this beautiful travel Tuesday.  
  
What's one of the best meals you have had while traveling?

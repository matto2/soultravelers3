Apple Macbook  
We just bought this laptop for Mozart and we love it! It has all the latest bells and whistles that makes it even easier in some ways, although the Spanish keyboard is sometimes a challenge. As Mozart gets older though, it will be useful to have both Spanish and English keyboards at her disposal. We particularly like the improvements on i-photo and i-movie compared to our older Mac and like having youTube, Googlemaps, Wikipedia and Yahoo clickables. Since many of Mozart's software programs are on the other computer, I end up using this one a lot. Many things are just easier and more intuitive on the Macs, even for a tech dummy like me.

Travel to Bhutan should be on everyone's bucket list. Bhutan is breathtakingly beautiful,  pristine, and is called  the last Shangri La on earth. We're traveling here now as a family, it is our 41st country ( on 5 continents) and one of the most spectacular that we have seen in our [five years of non-stop travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "non-stop around the world family travel"). Bhutan is considered one of the most exclusive travel destinations in the world and has only been open to the world to visit since the 1970's ( they have only had TV since 1999).

We're very honored to be the first travel bloggers to be hosted by the amazing [Tourism Council of Bhutan](http://www.tourism.gov.bt/ "Tourism Council of Bhutan"). Like Eric Weiner's [_Geography of Bliss_](http://cgeorge1b.blogspot.com/2010/11/bhutan-happiness-is-policy.html "Geography of Bliss"), I've come to really admire a country who's King's primary goal is to make every decion based on the people's Gross National Happiness. Seems like we need more leaders who think like this.  
  
I admire this tourism board because they align with the King's wishes, so are very smart about tourism, realizing that keeping the countries traditions, plus sustainable living and travel must work together to make it a win/win for all. We've been told that 70% of the country is forested and 90% of the food is grown organically. We admire these goals, the wonderful ( and happy) people of Bhutan that we have met here, the gorgeous landscapes, the incredible architecture and culture as well as the deep compassion and sweetness that one feels here.  
  
We'll be writing much more about our travels in Bhutan, but do join us  and check out our many photos on our [Soultravelers3 Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/soultravelers3#!/pages/Soultravelers3com-Around-the-World-Family-Travel-Education-Adventure/185105005187 "Soultravelers3 facebook fan page"). It's a very diverse country and this photo was taken of the Himalaya Mountains with a woman and her baby in temporary housing on the edge of paradise where new houses were being built. Around every corner there are awe inspiring views, so we have wonderful photos, video and stories coming soon.  
  
Is Bhutan on your bucket travel list or are you one of the lucky ones who have already been?

One of the joys of wandering the streets of a foreign land, is taking in the unique architecture and I have endless photos of beautiful doors from [our travels.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "our world travel") I could do a whole series just from the beautiful doors in our little [white village in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html "white village in spain") where we wintered for four years. Europe is especially rich with beautiful doors, but we've also loved them in Asia and almost every country and continent we have visited.  
  
Perhaps because we have [built a house](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "built a house") with beautiful hand-made doors or because DaVinci just had a dream about doors, this photo caught my eye. I think it was taken in Spain but not in our village ( I'd have to track it back to know exactly where and don't have that luxury of time right now as 6 years of [non-stop travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "non-stop travel") makes our photo collection HUGE and we are packing up to head to Asia for the winter).

Do you like doors as you travel as much as we do?

![Sunset Spain, tree, family travel & reminders from Tim Ferriss, Rolf Potts, 4hww](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330120a8ecce5f970b.jpg)

Family travel must include relaxation and enjoying the awesome gifts of nature that surround us like this beautiful sunset just out our door in [Andalusia, Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia). We've experienced some of the [most beautiful sunset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/soultravelers3/2524899259/)s [in the world](http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_23325.shtml) here on a regular basis. I love the sounds of birds chirping  like a symphony providing the perfect back drop music as the colors explode and shift. 

I had intended to get my book review of [Tim Ferriss's](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) amazing new expanded edition of [The 4-Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Expanded-Updated-Cutting-Edge/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1267553287&sr=1-1-fkmr0) in which we are [featured Case Studies](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/12/31/cold-remedy-15-real-world-lifestyle-design-case-studies-now-its-your-turn/) up today. I am a raving [fan of 4HWW](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html) & it's been at the top of my list since I received my complementary review copy that my mom forwarded to me. Hopefully, I can get it up next week.

My recovery from [my injury last August](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html) is much slower than I'd like it to be, so I remain a one left handed bandit which slows everything down. I'm making very good progress and am no longer in pain, thankfully, but still haven't caught up with all that I missed that backed up when I was totally out of commission.

To add to that I am now dealing with a serious case of [Candida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_%28genus%29) in my intestines, lungs and skin from all the IV antibiotics they gave me when I had surgery & DaVinci has a [serious dental issue](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/dentists-travel.html) that we've been dealing with [visiting 4 dentists](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/doctors-and-den.html) here and several alternative doctors that we work with online. All will be fine & I've already learned a tremendous amount, but it's also more time consuming stuff to add to our plate.

Recently I talked to [Rolf Potts](http://www.vagablogging.net/) via email & even though I've [long](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html) been a [huge fan of his book](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/books_rtw_travel/page/3/), [Vagabonding](http://www.amazon.com/Vagabonding-Uncommon-Guide-Long-Term-Travel/dp/0812992180/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1267556143&sr=1-1), I loved his recent [guest post on 4HWW](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/02/25/rolf-potts-vagabonding-travel/#more-2647), because it was such a great reminder on what is important. 

**1) Time = Wealth**

**2) Be Where You Are**

**3) Slow Down**

**4) Keep it Simple**

We live these principals and have for years, but some times in Spain in my efforts to "catch up" I find myself working too hard. My birthday arrives this month & it's clearer than ever that I want and need to do less. We have so much to share, but not always the time to do it properly, I'm not [Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/) who can write 4 blog post in a morning while being a social media king, nor do we have a staff helping us, so I must accept the pace that I can do. 

I actually miss unplugging lots like when we are on the move and I need to do that more while in Spain. Thanks Tim & Rolf for the reminders and for my recent health challenges in teaching me greater acceptance on what can realistically get done in a day, week or month when one is traveling in the slow lane. Always useful to keep relearning this lesson of balance in a passionate, creative life.

"There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living; there is nothing harder to learn" Seneca

How do you handle these types of challenges and what are your keys?

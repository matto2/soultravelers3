Do you know how to clean your hair without shampoo? Did you know  that you never have to shampoo your hair again and can go shampoo free forever?  
  
You don't REALLY need shampoo or cream rinse, so you can save a bundle and protect yourself, your family and the environment from all the harmful chemicals in these beauty products. For those that are concerned about [travel and health](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "travel and health"), there is even an extra benefit, as you do not have to worry about liquid shampoo in your carry-on luggage.  
  
This fabulous alternative shampoo method has become one of our latest [travel health secrets!](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health secrets")  
  
**WHY AVOID BEAUTY PRODUCTS LIKE SHAMPOO AND CREAM RINSE?**  
  
Due to [our travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "our travel lifestyle"), I kind of ignored the many issues with  [beauty products](http://www.discoverhealthandwealth.com/toxic-ingredients.html "toxic shampoo ingredients") until recently during my [health journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "health journey links for better health"), where we tweaked our [organic eating](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic eating raw food") and [minimalist living](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist living and travel") while [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "traveling the world as a family RTW"), to include things like [DIY deodorant](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-diy-homemade-deodorant-easy-cheap-healthy.html "DIY deodorant").  
  
It is a bit shocking to discover how much harm comes from [shampoo](http://www.livestrong.com/article/160204-harmful-chemicals-in-shampoos/ "toxic shampoo"), creme rinse and [beauty products](http://www.naturalcosmeticnews.com/toxic-products/list-of-15-toxic-chemicals-to-avoid-in-personal-care-products/ "toxins in beauty products ") and how they [impact health](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/22/toxic-chemicals-in-beauty_n_639418.html#s111546&title=Phthalates_and_bisphenol "toxic chemicals in beauty products harms health") and our environment. I didn't realize there were no controls and even [popular shamoo brands have been known to cause nerve damage](http://www.naturalnews.com/003210_personal_care_products_shampoos.html "shampoo causes nerve damage") according to researchers at the National Institute of Health.  
  
Everyone should read about the [common myths about cosmetics safety](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/myths-on-cosmetics-safety/ "myths about cosmetic safety") from the Environmental Working Group to understand how important this issue is and how ill informed most of us are. EGW also has a very useful [cosmetic data base](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ "cosmetic data base skin deep ") where one can gather more information about products.  
  
**ABSORBING SYSTEMIC  CHEMICALS AND TOXINS THROUGH SKIN AND SCALP**  
  
"Skin is a body organ like the heart. We must treat it with the same respect" Aragon  
  
The skin absorbs over 60% of topically used products and these [toxins/chemicals](http://cincovidas.com/toxic-alert-skin-can-absorb-what-we-apply-to-it%E2%80%94including-cosmetic-chemicals/ "toxins and chemicals in beauty products absorbed by skin") ( unlike the ones we eat,so even more harmful) go directly into the bloodstream as they bypass the liver and kidneys and their protection.  
  
“Recent studies by dermatologists at the University of California and a multiple university cooperative team confirm that skin absorption is the major route of entry \[for chemicals from skin or hair products getting into the womb\].”  
  
I paid a lot of attention to [toxins in our food and environment](http://www.amazon.com/Poisoned-Profit-Chronically-Ill-With-information/dp/1603582568/ref=pd_sim_b_33 "toxins in our food and environment") when I was pregnant and my child was small, but I am grateful to my recent health crisis because this new research has given me many more  ideas on how I can support greater health for myself, my family and the environment.  
  
"Change is upon us. We can choose to see it as frightening and incapacitating, or we can embrace the opportunities and move forward with hope towards a more sustainable world." Wendy Priesnitz  
  
  
**GOING SHAMPOO LESS IS SO EASY AND CHEAP**  
  
When I first started going shampoo free, my daughter said, " Oh no. You are taking this too far" and I had to giggle. I had to educate her about the reason behind this change and how [frangrances](http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id=644 "toxins in fragrances") that she is attracted to can have 4000 chemicals in them.... many that harm and are unregulated.  
  
All these [toxins and chemicals](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/04/16/early-precocious-puberty.aspx "toxins affect early puberty") are the reason why puberty use to start at 15 and now is starting at 7, 8 and 9 years old. It's shocking that endocrine-distrupters and "xeno-estrogenns" like BPA are so ubiquitous that the EWG researchers found it in 90% of newborns along with 230 other chemicals.  
  
We are frugal parents raising a frugal kid, so she did get the advantages of saving money right away. Since she has a [passion for green issues](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/environmental-education-world-school-kid.html "kid with passion for green environmental issues"), she understood immediately that not only do these chemicals harm our bodies and hair, but they are also washed down the drain causing harm to the environment and ecosystems.  
  
![baking soda makes a great natural shampoo and coconut oil is fab for deep conditioning hair ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c322a8e47970b.jpg)  
  
  
**'POO FREE STILL MEANS BEAUTIFUL HAIR**  
  
I must admit, I was a little nervous to try this method. Great in theory, but will it work?  
  
Truthfully, it is not that much of a different process than using shampoo and cream rinse. Only now, I make my own, know it is healthy and I was thrilled with the results.  
  
I have oily, baby fine and natually wavy hair. Davinci has extremely thick hair and Mozart has perfect hair that is not too thick or thin and can go straight or curly easily. This works great for all of us.  
  
My hair tangles VERY easily, so that was my big concern as I can not even comb it out normally without creme rinse. Mozart's is so long, comb outs were also a concern. I was stunned that this is not a problem.  
  
  
**HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN CHEAP, EASY, WONDERFUL SHAMPOO AND CREME RINSE**  
  
You can find other complicated variations for natual alternatives for [shampoo and creme rinse online,](http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2012/03/homemade-coconut-milk-shampoo.html "shampoo natural diy") but this is the one I like because it is so easy, cheap and simple to find around the world. We usually can find Braggs apple cider vinegar, but if not, lemons are every where ( as is baking soda which we also use for cleaning, brushing our teeth and deodorant etc).

**  
INGREDIENTS FOR SHAMPOO-FREE**  
  
Baking soda  
  
Water  
  
Apple cider vinegar ( or lemon)  
  
Essential oils ( optional and I have not used this but listing it for those who want a healthy fragrance)  
  
**HOW TO MAKE DIY SHAMPOO AND CREME RINSE**  
  
SHAMPOO  
  
1 tablespoon baking soda and 1 cup of water  
  
Mix and store in a bottle ( old shampoo container or squeeze bottle) I just use the left over small goat milk bottles I have here.  
  
Get your hair wet, pour the mixture on your head, rub it in and let it set for a minute or two and rinse off.  
  
That is it!  
  
NATURAL CREME RINSE  
  
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar and 1 cup water  
  
Pour over hair, massage a bit and rinse.  
  
That is it!  
  
We almost always just let our hair dry naturally and don't even own a hair dryer. Some say it takes a few weeks for your hair and scalp to adjust to the no 'poo way, because hair adapts to the hash detergents in normal shampoo, but we found it worked immediately.  
  
This is the standard recipe, but you can tweak it to suit your hair or family if you need that.  Some might like a little more or less, but this seems to work fine for us. If I need a deep conditioning I use organic  virgin coconut oil.  
  
I was worried about the vinegar smell, and you do smell it when you pour it on, but surprisingly there is no smell after you rinse it or when it is dry.  I've been absolutely stunned at how well it helps with easy comb outs for myself and Mozart. I have been misinformed for decades that I could not live without creme rinse.

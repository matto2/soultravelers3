What are the best things to do in [Beiing, China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "beijing china") and can a [family trave](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "family travel around the world digital nomads")l independently there for a special vacation?   
  
Does the 21st century belong to **[China](http://magazine.fourseasons.com/travel-food-style/things-to-do/beijing_now)** as so many predict about this fastest growing super power?   
  
“If the 19th century belonged to Britain, and the 20th century to the United States, then the 21st century will surely belong to China.” (Jim Rogers)

As adventurous, monolingual [American parents raising](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "raising educating a gifted child through travel") a young [trilingual daughter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "how to raise a multilingual child") who is [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "fluent in Mandarin american kid"), we think there has never been a better time to visit this 5,000-year-old culture and booming, exciting, exotic, warm-hearted country! With more than 3 million overseas tourists visiting Beijing every year, it takes no time to understand why—with its six **[UNESCO World Heritage Sites](http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/cn)**, scrumptious food, art and shopping.  
  
![Panjiayuan Antique Market in Beijing china](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c356c5ebc970b.jpg)  
  
  
The brand-new, exquisite **[Four Seasons Hotel Beijing](http://www.fourseasons.com/beijing/)** was the perfect place to begin our month-long independent tour, where we mostly stayed with locals for [deep language immersion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "deep language immersion and learning in China"). We arrived on opening day and were very honored to be one of the first guests to be spoiled by the glorious opulence and spectacular service—starting with a limo ride from the airport, which comforted us after a long flight and pampered us as we adjusted to this fast-paced, dramatic city of 22 million.

One of the things that most impressed us about China was the generosity, [kindness](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/random-acts-of-kindness-in-travel.html "kindness - random acts story") and hospitality of the people; that we will treasure in our memories forever. Since this was a self-created language immersion trip for our 12 year old, we requested that Four Seasons staff speak to her only in Mandarin. That gave her more confidence as we explored the city to approach and talk to strangers in Chinese.

How lucky our daughter was to already be [fluent in Chinese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "becoming fluent in mandarin in Asia student tips") on her [first visit to China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/getting-a-tourism-visa-for-china-adventure.html "getting visa for china"). It helped so much for all of us to bond in deeper ways with the people, and be a [bridge between East and West](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-bridge-summer-palace.html "bridge between east and west through Mandarin"). People lit up in delighted surprise to see a little blond girl able to communicate well, as few on the streets speak English.

The **[Four Seasons concierge](http://www.fourseasons.com/beijing/services_and_amenities/family/)** arranged a perfect tour of city highlights with Peking duck for lunch at one of the most famous restaurants in Beijing, which enchanted each one of us and gave us a royal start to **[our China journey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/soultravelers3-in-china-emperors-style.html#more).

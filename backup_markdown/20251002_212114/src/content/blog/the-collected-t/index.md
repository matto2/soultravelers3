The Collected Traveler Northern Spain  
I really love this book and wish they had one for every area.They are just so juicy and delightful to savor. We had planned to go to Northern Spain on our first explorations of this journey in 2006, but life happens, so I have had a long time to really take in all the glories of this book. I fell deeply in love with Northern Spain just by reading this book, so glad we are finally goingÂ  the summer of 2008. If you like to get a deep sense of an area before going, these books are for you.

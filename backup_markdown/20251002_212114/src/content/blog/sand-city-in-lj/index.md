This is Mozart at 6 making a whole city of sand castles in Ljubljana, Slovenia in the fall of 2007.

This is the video that we made during our travels in Slovenia. You can read more about this beautiful area [here](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/lovely-ljublija.html) and [here](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/beautiful-lake.html).

There is nothing this girl loves more than elaborate projects and she finds them everywhere. We spent lots of time touring this pretty city, but feel time for play like this in a nice playground is just as important for family travel. This one was right next to our RV campsite and became a favorite for Mozart to build to her hearts content.  
  
"Because this is fancy town!" Don't you love how kids think? I wonder if the fancy buildings we were seeing affected this sand city, or if it was all a figment of her imagination.

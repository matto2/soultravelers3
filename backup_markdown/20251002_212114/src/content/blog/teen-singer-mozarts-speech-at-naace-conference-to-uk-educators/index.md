14 year old [trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "trilingual Mozart speech") [singer/songwriter Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "singer songwriter Mozart") was asked to speak to over 250 UK educators at the [NAACE Conference 2015](http://www.naace.co.uk "naace") about her unusual [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/curriculum-vitae-for-a-gifted-child-world-schooling.html "world school CV for Mozart") education where we allowed the entire planet to be her classroom.

[Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/01/-q-a-mozarts-take-on-travel-music-homeschool.html "teen singer and traveler Mozart") has had an education like no one else on earth, so they were interested in getting her perspective since she is a pioneer in what is becoming a growing trend.

We actually met him about 7 years ago when we were in [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html "learning spanish in spain") and Mozart was taking a [Johns Hopkins University CTY](http://cty.jhu.edu "johns hopkins cty") online course. Finding the English books required in Spain was a challenge, I mentioned it on Twitter and like magic he came to our rescue and sent them from the UK.

He has always been on the cutting edge  of tech in education, enjoys creativity and our unusual story, so asked Mozart if she would participate via Skype.

It went so well, they said, they would ask her back in person next  year! We recorded the Skype session so did a Youtube video to share the experience with all.

Things have changed greatly since we started our location independent lifestyle in 2005 and took off to Europe in 2006. No smart phones then or social media, we had to start out with a huge portable satellite!

Nevertheless, tech, the internet and social media had a huge impact on our trip and her education. We never expected these changes when we left.

[Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/10/mozart-sings-at-the-house-of-blues.html "teen singer Mozart sings at house of blues") shared about her song You’re Not Alone that is going to be in a movie soon! She wrote it to help the cause of Human Trafficking.

Her song [Ashes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3_kNH3RU3Y "\"Ashes\" by Mozart") is also going to be in a movie, the same one she is starring in and that shoots in May and June.

She has a new fast song out called Round The world which is about to be released thanks to the help she is getting from fans on her [GoFundMe](http://www.gofundme.com/t7q2nx8%20 "gofundme for Mozart's music") ( that you are welcome to participate in!).

We didn’t know how her education would affect her, but we see now that her travels, her languages ( fluent Mandarin and Spanish) and unusual education has had a huge effect on her music and a blossoming career that is taking off early.

**WORLDSCHOOL TO COLLEGE**

We're about to enter a new paradigm as we try to ride 3 horses, continue travel, support Mozart in making her first album and budding acting career plus prepare for her going to Harvard or similar university as she starts 9th grade this fall.   
  
Thankfully we have Author and former Brown Dean [Joyce Reed](http://www.collegegoals.com/team/joyce_reed.html "Joyce Reed") and [Gail Lewis](http://www.collegegoals.com/team/gail_lewis.html "Gail Lewis of College Goals") of [College Goals](http://www.collegegoals.com "college goals") to help us navigate this as a [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschool and travel"), or rather [Worldschoo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/travel-schooling-learning-through-travel.html "travel schooling or world schooling")l family!   
  
 For us, her world schooling education and our travels were the best decisions of our lives, so I hope we can inspire others to do their own version and encourage schools to find ways to be more expansive.

Family travel is often about doing ordinary things in extraordinary places as this photo demonstrates so well! Mozart adores babies and is outgoing so always [meets friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/questions-answers-about-soultravelers3-family-travel.html) of all ages where ever she goes. When we visited the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](http://www.metmuseum.org/) in NYC last fall while there to meet all the [disadvantaged school kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/the-traveling-o.html) that travel [with us virtually](http://twitpic.com/kfu0), Mozart and a little Japanese toddler became instant buddies who were fascinated with each other.

It is a spectacular [museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art), especially the [Egyptian sectio](http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/egyptian_art)n which we focused on to help prepare us for our trip there soon. Mozart, who has [seen more](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/pompeiiburied-a.html) than [her share](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/ephesus-stellar.html) of [ancient](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/06/acropolis-parth.html) civilization [ruins](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/07/the-palace-of-k.html), loved it, but she also really enjoyed this special encounter with this playful child. I think both have value!

We parents all sat back and allowed them to play a little surrounded by this stunning environment. Children also help adults connect, as I am sure we never would have ended up in conversation with this lovely family had they not been attracted to one another.

Just one more reason, why I think that slow family travel is the very best travel on earth!

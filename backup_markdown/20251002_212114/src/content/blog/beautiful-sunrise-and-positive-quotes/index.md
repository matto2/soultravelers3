"The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you. Don't go back to sleep." Rumi

When you have set a goal for yourself--whether it's short-term or long-term--envision yourslef getting there. Use your creative imagination and see yoursel attaining your goal. That's a good wat to stimulate the success mechanism, a good way to prime the pump. Hold the image of your success and your completion in front of you, and keep moving forward. It will become obvious, moment to moment, what must be done next. All you hae to do is hold to that completed image of success as your direciton and then move to the next obvious thing to be done. That's living in the now, and that's success. " - John-Roger  
  
Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world." Gustave Flaubert

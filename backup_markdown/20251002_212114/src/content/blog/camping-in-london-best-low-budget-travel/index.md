Looking for cheap accommodations in expensive London for your family or going to the Olympics? Most people don't think about [camping in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "camping Europe") or camping in London, but it's a fantastic budget way to travel and very popular with European budget travelers. Or should I say like the Brits... travellers and holiday makers?  
  
There are actually five campsites within the 117-mile or 188km London Orbital (  or M25 motorway) that encircles greater London and with their  efficient mass transit ( buses, "tube" and trains etc) you can easily get anywhere and see it all. You don't need a motorhome or caravan either, as almost all [camping sites in Europe allow tents](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/big-tent-camping-in-europe-glamping-european-style-frugal-minimalist-luxury-backpacking-flashpacking.html "tent camping europe") and even cottages to rent.  
  
**CAMPING LONDON TIPS**  
  
Even in summer high season, we didn't find it very crowded and it was also a great way to connect with other Europeans. We met families from the UK as well as France, Italy, Germany and many other countries. [Camping is family friendly and kids love,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/camping-europe-with-kids-free-kids-clubs-family-friendly-international-travel-tips.html "camping family friendly and kids love") it, but it's also ideal for seniors, couples and singles. Like most campgrounds in Europe, we almost never meet any one from the United States.

Here the number 3 bus will take you directly to Piccadilly, plus Travel cards can be bought on site, it's next to a Park and just a 10 minute walk from Christal Palace center. There is endless entertainment in London from the [Globe theatre](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html#more "globe theatre london") to [free museums](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-london-free-museums-educational-family-adventures-for-homeschool.html "free museums london") to [Hamleys](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/travel-kids-london-hamleys-toy-store.html "travel kids hamleys london") to name a few and why we keep returning to this global city over and over.  
  
One of my goals this year in Asia is to write a book about [camping in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/rv-in-europe-road-trip-europe-camping-european-style.html "camping in europe") because we have so much experience after 6 years of traveling Europe, but in the meantime, check out these [good books for camping Europe.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/best-books-for-camping-europe-road-trip-european-rv-tent-or-cottage-bungalow-rental-vacation-holiday.html "good books for camping Europe")

Historic [Georgetown,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town,_Penang "georgetown") the capital, is a unique UNESCO World Heritage site and the food in Penang is said to be the best in Asia ( some say the world).

**LOOKING FOR AN IDEAL LOCATION INDEPENDENT PLACE TO WINTER?**

As many of our readers know, we have spent the last four [winters "Mediterranean style"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "mediterranean style on costa del sol, spain")  in the same [small sunny village in Andalusia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/our-village.html "small sunny village in Andalusia")  and gave our [best tips for finding a winter rental apartment or home in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330120a6e278a6970b "best tips for finding a winter rental apartment or home in Spain") and [keys to location independent wintering in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "keys to location independent wintering in Spain").

 We really enjoyed our time in Spain, so I was looking for a similar set up ( which was also not too dissimilar to  our warm, sunny winters in a small, family -friendly  town in California). I had found a real estate person online for Penang & talked to her via email about six months before arrival, so knew that we could easily find something nice in our price range which was 400 to 700 dollars a month for a high end, fully furnished,  3 bedroom home or apartment.

![tranquil ocean view from our winter home in Penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330148c6eeff2c970c.jpg)

Once I knew that, I didn't do any more as I knew it could be easily handled on the ground once we arrived ( and I had 14 stops before that so [enough on my plate](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/mourning-while-traveling-tribute-to-al-grief-and-travel-deathdying-at-a-distance.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330148c6782e6f970c "enough on my plate") to look at). You can find an apartment or rental MUCH cheaper ( I've seen ads from 12 dollars to 100 dollars a month for [studios or private rooms](http://www.caribilik.my/rooms/penang "penang room rentals") in a home), but we wanted a three bedroom, 2 bathroom, large, luxurious home for the winter, so we went for the higher price ( about 700 dollars a month rent) when we fell in love with this one with spectacular ocean views from every room.( A FAR inferior, smaller,  unfurnished 2 bedroom rental with no views, cost us $1700.00 a month in California before we left in 2005, after we sold our home).

**LUXURY BEACH RENTAL IN PENANG**

**SUPER EASY TO FIND A FURNISHED RENTAL APARTMENT OR HOUSE IN PENANG**

We did not have a place to stay when we arrived, nor an apartment lined up, but we found this one immediately, fell in love with it and were in it within two days. [Guest houses are cheap in Penang,](http://www.travellerspoint.com/budget-accommodation-en-ci-954.html "guest houses are cheap in Penang")( 6 to 30 dollars a night)  so I had planned on staying in one for about a week while we did a little house hunting and exploring on the ground after arrival, to find the perfect place. Fate was on our side though and  Twitter friends and fellow bloggers ( [Aussies Colin and Tracy & their cute preschool kids](http://ourtravellifestyle.com/ "colin & tracy "))  generously invited us to stay with them, so we had many short cuts, thanks to the knowledge that they had gained while living in Penang for several months. Yes, there are more gorgeous apartments & not so gorgeous, but this one had a zen feel that we liked at a price we could pay. I had wanted to go for cheaper, but with my mom visiting us this winter and Mozart starting a new school, we wanted comfort and this feels like a home, not an apartment.

**OUR PENANG APARTMENT DETAILS**

We chose a large, over 1250 square feet, 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment in a top luxury resort with upscale furniture,spectacular ocean views from every bedroom and the living room. It's incredibly quiet and peaceful as no one else is on the 16th floor with us. A good desk with chair is in two of the bedrooms and tons of closet space. Full good sized kitchen with propane gas burners, washer, dryer, stove, rice cooker, wok, large toaster oven, microwave, water filter, electric kettle and more including all dishes and large closet. There is a balcony with furniture ,FREE wifi, television (with both Mandarin and some English shows from America),DVD player, CD player, sheets, pillows, blankets, juicer, silverware, tupperware, cleaning supplies,vacuum cleaner etc included. We have covered parking for two cars, but we use the bus as we find it extremely cheap and convenient for our lifestyle.

There are two large bathrooms with two showers and one bathtub and both have heated water (an extra in Asia). It's air conditioned in every room, but we have yet to use it as the weather has been a perfect 75 to 85, almost always sunny and we get wonderful, cool cross breezes day and night from being so close to the sea. There are ceiling fans in every room, but we tend to just use the living room one during the day and our bedroom at night, (they're just not needed). Haven't gotten our electric or water bill, but our friends say it is almost nothing and they used the air conditioning every night. I had heard many horror stories about the heat and humidity in Asia so I'm very happy to find it so pleasantly perfect. We've slept with light blankets every night. There is a large vestibule with two doors at the entrance ( which is usually kept open), where one traditionally keeps shoes in a cabinet as people here do not use them inside the home, (a normal custom for us as well).

**ADVANTAGES TO LIVING IN A LUXURY RESORT IN PENANG**

The gated resort is perfect for families with kids as well as singles, couples or retirees and it's maintained very well, plus with excellent 24 hour security guards. There is a huge pool area which is always almost empty. Also a good playground, jacuzzi, several pools (in several locations) waterslide,  free wifi with large room to plug in (two locations with different wifi),state of the art large exercise room, sauna, meeting rooms, waterfalls, free English books to share and more. Garbage is in a locked container outside the apartment on our floor near the elevator and picked up twice a day and floors mopped then too. It's easy and cheap to hire private housekeepers, but we do not need that.

The beach and bus stop are across the street and there are two large resort hotels nearby that allow you to use their facilities like restaurants, taxi stand or tourism guided tours etc. (It costs about 300 dollars a month to rent a car, but we like the new buses that all have air conditioning and free wifi that cost 45 cents for adults and Mozart is free. it's a small island with basically one road around it and driving is on the British side with tons of traffic, difficult parking and crazy mopeds.)

Adults can sunbathe, swim laps, take water aerobics classes, talk with other parents etc, while kids swim in separate pools, enjoy the  playground or tool around on scooters. There is an interesting eclectic mix of locals and fascinating expats from Australia,Japan, Hungary, Korea, USA, India, UK, Slovakia, Taiwan, Canada and more who are very friendly and helpful. There are an endless variety of classes, sports, volunteer opportunities for adults and kids, great International schools ( American, UK), Mandarin schools, and homeschool opportunities. Good  Health care ( doctors, hospitals, medicine, dentists etc)  is cheap and plentiful. Many come here for medical tourism.  Private Tutors, after school classes and preschools are good, cheap and abundant.

**SHOPPING MALLS AND MOVIES IN PENANG**

![Penang Mall](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e142f5d2970b.jpg)

There are two HUGE modern malls nearby, that are bigger than the malls in Silicon Valley, which is astounding because Penang is a very small island (with a long bridge to the mainland).  There is not much that you can not find here and most of it is exceedingly cheap. English is everywhere since there are 3 cultures in Malaysia and that is the common language, thus much easier than Europe in that way and an endless supply of both English and Chinese books for all ages. Shopping, movies and food seem to be passionate pleasures for Asians. The movie theaters are grand with the latest movies and treats with ridiculously low prices like 2 dollars for the latest hit movie.  Or as DaVinci says, "This is what things should cost". Since we haven't seen any English movies in 5 years, this has become a once a week family treat for us.

**PENANG'S IS WORLD FAMOUS FOR IT'S DELICIOUS FOOD**

![Penang cuisine](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330148c74c8e92970c.jpg)

![world famous food in penang, malaysia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e14a7312970b.jpg)

[Penang is world famous for it's food](http://hubpages.com/hub/Penangs_Food "penang is famous for it's food") and Hawkers Markets ( according to Time Magazine, Lonely Planet and many publications) and I will be writing more about this in detail. They say it is the best food in Asia. Singaporeans drive 9 hours just to eat this food as a special treat. Many people fly into here just for the food. Although the Chinese are a big majority here in Penang, there are 3 dominant cultures in Malaysia, so one finds a huge variety of good food, some of the best Chinese, Indian and Malay food as well as delicious Korean, Japanese, Thailand ( very close border) and even western restaurants.

**PLEASURES OF HOME COOKING AND GARDENING & LEARNING TO COOK CHINESE**

It is common in Asia to eat many or most meals out as it is almost as cheap as making it yourself and is just part of the culture. But we much prefer to cook our own food mostly when we are wintering as we enjoy the soul enriching family routines of cooking, eating together intimately and gardening when we are traveling less. As a former year-round-organic- gardener, I prefer to have control over the food that I feed my child and family from start to finish. We enjoy the food markets here that locals use and sometimes the modern, large grocery stores that have everything from organic peanut butter to frozen waffles, organic flax seed and French goat cheese. Mostly we stick with the local things like their awesome fresh-off-the- tree papaya's, mangoes, bananas etc. and I'm loving learning to cook many simple Chinese and Asian dishes.

**HIGH QUALITY LIFE AT LOW PRICES**

We came primarily because it is a fantastic place to immerse deeply in Mandarin through an all Chinese school for our 10 year old child, but we found so many things that we love here, besides the ones we have already mentioned. Like:

\* Very easy to explore other parts of diverse Malaysia and Asia from here by cheap flights, boats or trains

\* Very close to major hubs like Singapore and Bangkok or even Hong Kong and Taiwan

\* Not touristy ( outside of the highlights of Georgetown)

\* Very friendly, accepting  and open society, a melting pot (once part of the British Empire)

\* Chinese, Malay and Indian cultures to explore, English spoken everywhere, English signage

\* Good airport with lots of flights in and out to Asia and around the world

\* Rainy season means almost always sun with 15/20 minutes of rain and thunderstorm some evenings

\* Unlike most of Asia, foreigners can buy landed property as well as condominiums and homes

\* NOT a sex tourism destination country

\* No major political turmoil, stable economy and government, religious tolerance  is a tradition

\* Safe and very expat friendly (easy to get long stay visa or do visa runs)

**MALAYSIA RANKS AS BEST PLACE TO RETIRE IN ASIA**

The first time at a place is always hardest (next year will be a piece of cake) but  Penang is well set up to easily find a rental home very quickly as there are a ton available. One of the attractions here for us and many is [Malaysia's My Second Home Programme](http://www.mm2h.gov.my/ "malaysias my second home programme") which makes it very appealing to expats from around the world. We may or may not ever get involved with their program but the advantages are so fantastic, that it seems a wise move to pick this spot as a long stay option to get to know better, should we later want to participate. We like to winter in places that have good future potential, thus learning Mandarin in Penang made lots more sense than China. Penang is a popular spot for visitors from Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Korea, Russia, Eastern Europe, UK, Taiwan and more. That said, although there are many Caucasians at our resort, out and about, we are usually the only Caucasians in sight on buses, planes, stores, movies or in the mall etc, but it has never been a problem so we feel very comfortable.

**QUESTIONS?**

 Is there anything else that you would like to know about renting a place in Penang for a few weeks or a few months or a few years?

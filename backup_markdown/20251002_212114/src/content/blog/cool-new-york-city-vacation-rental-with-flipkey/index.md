"I want to live here!" Mozart said as we walked into our NYC vacation rental by [FlipKey](http://www.flipkey.com/ "flipkey"). For big city getaways or family vacations, rented furnished apartments or homes are often ideal for value, size and amenities.

This three bedroom sanctuary with a state of the art kitchen in an historic home impressed us all!

When we were suddenly, (out of the blue),  heading to [New York City for Fashion Week](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/09/mozarts-adventures-during-new-york-fashion-week.html#more "Mozart's Adventures in New York City for Fashion Week") so Mozart could be the [youngest reporter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/09/mozart-is-youngest-reporter-at-new-york-fashion-week.html#more "Mozart is Youngest Reporter at New York Fashion Week!"), we soon discovered what a difficult time that was to book something in Manhattan. [Flipkey](https://twitter.com/flipkey "flipkey on twitter") is a long time friend from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 on twitter"), so they came to the rescue and it was an easy orderly process from start to finish.

I was amazed by how many places they had available for NYC on their website. 2579 short term rental apartments starting at 11 dollars a night all the way up to $5,495.00 for one night!

As a family who has [strict dietary needs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/06/how-to-stay-healthy-while-traveling-paleo-road-trip.html#more "How to stay healthy while traveling and eating strict diet like paleo"), and [traveling with health concerns](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "traveling when sick or health challenges"), we really appreciate the convenience of a kitchen when we travel, and this one was sublime.

One of the first things we did is hit the Whole Foods store and get some [organic groceries](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "healthy organic food and travel") to cook up some of our favorite foods. We ate breakfast and dinner here and had yummy lunches around Manhattan while exploring.This keeps us healthy and our budget low, while still enjoying the restaurants in NYC.

It instantly felt like home in this newly renovated 1000 square foot historic house on a landmark block.  
  
![Cool New York City Vacation Rental with FlipKey](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb0789b675970d.png)  
  
It accomodates 4 adults and 2 children, so we had more than enough cookware, bakeware and utensils, plus it had a luxury Bertazzoni range,new Bosch dishwasher, filtered water dispenser, quality coffeemaker, food processor, blender and more.

The living room was large and comfortable with a flat-screen TV and a writing desk with an Apple iMac with hi-speed internet and wifi that we put to good use.  
  
![Teen singer Mozart likes this antique bed!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c6e4af8d970b.png)  
  
Mozart loved her room with antique bed...

It's a lot of fun to run around [New York](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-nyc-usa-metropolitan-museum-of-art-egyptian.html "New York City family travel") and explore all of it's delights...

...take taxi's, limo's, subway, buses or walk, but it is also such an intense city, that it is key to come home to peace and quiet after a full day of exploring the Big Apple's charms.

Our bedroom was large and very serene with an antique queen sleigh bed, chair, dresser and wood floors.

There was this amazing super moon when we arrived, so I got this great photo from the tree filled  backyard.

If you [travel light](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/top-travel-tip-for-long-term-travel.html "best tips for packing light ") like we do, the large capacity Electrolux washer/dryer will come in handy as it did for us.  
  
The owners of this vacation rental operate their own interior design business, so that was evident in so many ways from functionality to the ambiance of a country retreat infused with modern sensibility.  
  
![church ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301bb0789b726970d.png)  
  
It was in a quiet, mostly residential neighborhood and a few blocks from the subway. We really got the sense of what it is like to live like a local in this artistic neighborhood.

We loved our experience in NYC and with FlipKey who made the whole process and transition so easy that we can not recommend them highly enough. We were impressed.

New York City is one of our favorite places ( I lived their in the late 70's and 80's), so we will be back and now we know where to find amazing places to stay on a budget that works for a family! No matter where we go, we will keep FlipKey in mind. Thanks FlipKey for being a great lodging sponsor for this trip!

“Mommy, I lost my tooth!” Ms. Mozart was beside herself with excitement as she woke us up at four thirty in the morning to announce that her loose bottom tooth had fallen out and “it did not hurt at all”! She had come out of a deep sleep and did her usual habit these past few days of swirling her tongue against that loose tooth or wriggling it with her fingers...and low and behold, it was no longer there. 

She could not contain her elation as she has been waiting sooo long for this moment since all her friends lost them long ago. Without too much trouble we found it in our bed and after sharing in her enthusiasm from our groggy state,we finally calmed her down enough to go back to sleep.

In the morning we had to discuss it more of course and she can not wait to call grandma and auntie BJ and share the exciting news with them. We certainly cut it close getting the last picture taken with the baby teeth still in. She said she will always remember her sixth birthday in Paris and losing her first tooth in the Cote d’Ore in the middle of the night in our camper.

Needless to say, she is looking forward to the tooth fairy’s visit tonight which is our custom. We are wondering if she will leave money in Euros or dollars?

A  recent survey showed that 80% of Baby Boomers hoped to travel when they retire and many polls rank travel as the number one leisure activity for this age range. We [retired early to travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/retire-and-travel-the-world.html "retire early to travel the world") and are living proof that one doesn't have to be rich to [explore the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "explore the world") on a [permanent vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/08/secrets-for-a-permanent-vacation-travel-tips.html "permanent vacation") ( after 8 plus years of non-stop travel to 46 countries on 5 continents on just $23/day per person).  
  
We travel the world primarily to [educate our child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/nomadic-lifestyle-with-children-.html "travel the world as a family with kids") and have more time together and it is a strategy that has really worked for us, but may not be for everyone. If you dream about [retiring early and perpetual travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retire early and perpetual travel"), just know this IS a very doable dream for most ordinary folks and you can find a travel style that works for you.  
  
It is a myth that travel is expensive, so if you want more travel in your life, find ways to give that to yourself. It may mean giving up some of your possessions that are expensive and time consuming  to maintain ( [like our house](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html "selling your home for a dream")), but you might find out ( like we did)  that [living a minimalist life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist life style books") is very freeing indeed and you won't miss your ["stuff"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "stuff or over consumerism") at all.  
  
"One day you will wake up and there won't be any more time to do the things you always wanted. Do it now." Paulo Coelho

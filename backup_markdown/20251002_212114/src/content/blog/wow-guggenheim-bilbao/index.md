Yes! This stunning titanium masterpiece, that is the world famous Museo Guggenheim, absolutely lives up to the hype and still impresses in person, no matter how many pictures you might have seen. It is also one of the most fun museums for [family travel](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/09/travel/frugal-traveler-food-too-is-an-art-in-bilbao.html)! Even for non architecture fans, one can instantly see why it has been called the most important structure of it's time. Kudos to California architect & truly masterful artist [Frank Gehry.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry)

No, the art was not the impressive part and in fact that was a bit weak, although fun, interesting and entertaining. It was  the amazing building that was the star and endlessly fascinating.

When we were there the theme was a surreal one with art by [Juan Munoz](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2000/oct/04/art.artsfeatures) being featured along with the regular collection. Mozart particularly liked [Richard Serra's massive steel sculptures](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2005/jun/22/art), [Jeff Koon's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Koons) enormous live-flowered [puppy](http://www.bluffton.edu/%7Esullivanm/spain/bilbao/koonspuppy/koons.html) standing outside and his colorful [huge Tulip bouquet](http://www.guggenheim.org/bilbao) on a back deck area over looking Louise Bourgeois'  gigantic [mother spider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maman).

The large pieces  interact with the building and landscape in a whimsical way that is provocative. Even the glass elevator (ala [Charlie and the Chocolate factory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory)) was a fun addition. The depth and breath of the exhilarating experience had us thinking about it and discussing it for weeks.

It is one of those places that you really just need to experience yourself, but here are a few pictures to give you a hint of the pleasure. Have you been to Museo Guggenheim in Bilbao or is it on your list?

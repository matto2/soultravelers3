Is [travel the best education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "travel best education")? Can [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family travel") enhance [learning for kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/10-tips-for-travel-tours-museums-with-kids-family-friendly-travel-advice-information-help-education.html "learning for kids travel")?  
  
Here is one good example about the [Roman army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army "roman army") which we have learned about through [books](http://soultravelers3new.local/books_travel_books_for_kids/ "books travel kids") as we have [traveled the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "travel the world as family") and some first hand experience in [Rome at the colosseum](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/colosseum-forum.html "Rome colosseum"), [Nimes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-nimes-france-.html "Nimes"), [Split Croatia's Diocletian's Palace](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/split-diocletia.html "split croatia's diocletia palace"), [Pompeii](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/04/pompeiiburied-a.html "pompeii travel"), [Ephesus, Turkey](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/ephesus-museum.html "Ephesus Turkey museum"), [Puy du Fou](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/06/family-travel-photofrance-puy-du-fou-theme-park-1.html "Puy du Fou, France"), [Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/roman-holiday-i.html "provence"),Â  [Hierapolis](Hierapolis "hierapolis, Turkey") ....to name just a few places that taught us about the Roman Empire.  
  
"Hey, we learned about that in Jerash" our ten year old said when we were watching the classic [Cleopatra with Elizabeth Taylor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=NGDyZHlHklo "cleopatra with elizabeth taylo") during a family movie night in our [motorhome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "motorhome europe") in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "Barcelona camping"). We all perked up on remembering our recent [family vacation to Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "family vacation jordan") and the exciting [Roman Army Experience and Chariot Race](http://www.jerashchariots.com/ "roman army and chariot race") in the 244 meter Hippodrome in one of the best-preserved and largest Greco-Roman cities in the world.  
  
I will be writing more about our experience in Jerash, but this photo shows one of the highlights where Roman Centurians demonstrated the "tortoise" and "anti-quus" etc moves that made the Roman army so powerful. When we saw it again in this historic movie, of course we had to smile. There is nothing quite like living history!  
  
What have been your favorite learning on vacation opportunities?

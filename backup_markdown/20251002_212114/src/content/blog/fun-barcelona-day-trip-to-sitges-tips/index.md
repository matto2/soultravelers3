 Our wonderful friend Parisian translator [Nadine Touzet](https://www.instagram.com/nadinetouzet/?hl=en) was [visiting Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/10/fall-color-halloween-in-barcelona.html) so we suggested that she take the train down to meet us in Sitges. We took a train and bus to meet her in Sitges as our [van life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/07/cheapest-way-to-travel-europe-budget-travel-must-read.html) [glamping](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/09/diy-luxury-glamping-near-barcelona-.html)  [beach resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html) is not far.

Now she is living in Normandy, so it is on our wish list to visit her soon. It was [Thanksgiving week](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/11/gratitude-quotes-autumn-beauty-giving-thanks.html) so we had a bit of a "friendsgiving" together on a most beautiful day. She had been having a wonderful time exploring all the [art museums](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/bye-bye-barcelo.html) in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/-barcelona-cava-cave-spanish-wine-catalan-champagne.html), but loved this getaway to see a bit of the coast.

My favorite thing to do in Sitges is just walk around as it is a perfect town for that. Even if you don't know a thing, if you wander you will enjoy the ambiance, architecture, palms and beaches. The tourism information center is right next to the lovely train station if you want to grab a map or get information. It is a very walkable town of 26000 permanent residents. Top sites to see? Church of Sant Bartomeu & Santa Tecla, Palau Maricel, Museu Cat Ferrat, Raco de la Calma, La Playa de Sitges, Museu de Maricel, to name few & all easily found on a walk. Sitges's palm laden sea front esplanade is called  Passeig Maritim and it is 3km long and winds from one end of town to the other, so you can soak up the all the sights & coastal views on the way.

Sometimes silly moments relaxing with friends are the best so this funny video makes me smile.

Sitges crowds really vary by season and day of the week and weekends are always more crowded, but much less crowds at this time of year than high season summer weekends. Sitges ( also known as the gay riviera) is very popular for families, couples and  with the LGBTI community, so it has a really buzzing nightlife and it's popular with expats.

Still there are 17 beaches near Sitges ( and more in close by communities) so you can always find a beach that works for you. Join the crowds or find a little nook for yourself.

This second picture is the beach in late November and frankly it is when I like it best. Lots of sailboats were out sailing and some were sunbathing and a few brave ones went in the water. You see in my first video on this post that even at early sunset there were some beach goers on the sand enjoying the beach. Seaside town is what Sitges is most known for.

The most famous & beautiful church of Sitges, located on the beach, is a17th-century parish church called Iglesia de Sant Bartomeu I Santa Tecla with spectacular views of Sitges from the rocky cliff. This little [Youtube short](https://www.youtube.com/@soultravelersiii3746/featured) I took shows you why this is a popular spot and how many sailboats were out that day.

Love this photo of one of our early visits to Sitges with [Gar](https://www.garreynadesign.com) &  [Heavenly](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com) in 2006 when we started our decade long [family world tour.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/05/travel-memories-from-around-the-world-roadschooling-.html) We [wintered in Andalucia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/05/learning-spanish-in-spain.html), but spent every spring and summer in [Barcelona beach](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/07/cheapest-way-to-travel-europe-budget-travel-must-read.html) area near Sitges. I was doing some acupuncture treatments in Sitges so we would go every week.

Now our daughter lives in LA, but she [visited us last summer,](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxLfFi8scIO/) so here is another picture of her exploring Sitges with her dad and I. Lots of happy memories and we keep making them. Every time you visit a place you learn more and it becomes more a part of you and we even know some people now who live there. We even bought Heavenly a guitar at the fantastic music store here.

Mediterranean, peaceful and captivating, the Sitges Promenade offers a fun, sunny stroll perfumed with saline sea scents along this enchanting golden coastline. This photo shows another viewing point ( from the beach & promenade)  of my 2nd photo close up. So many great views from this area.

As you wander aimlessly,  there is no shortage of charm and the scenic winding streets and alleyways are off-limits to motorized vehicles. Cobblestone streets, whitewashed buildings and whimsical details like colorful plaques, tiles, carved doors and windowsills/ balconies lined with flowers and Catalonia flags.   
  
  
![Fun Barcelona Day Trip to Sitges Tips! lots of cute shops like Sweet & Cool with bike](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302a30d4ea748200b-1024x576-1.jpg)  
  

Like most of Europe, there are plentiful sidewalk cafes, bars, restaurants, gelato shops, and boutiques to keep you entertained and it is a great place to indulge in a little retail therapy. Many, like our [Heavenly](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/05/heavenly-reyna-lands-next-movie-hits-twitchcon-paris.html),  enjoy browsing through all the designer clothes shops selling the latest offerings from top designer names from around the world.This [Instagrammable](https://www.instagram.com/soultravelers.3/) vintage bike and [Sweet & Cool](https://www.instagram.com/sweetandcoolbrand/) store window always makes me smile.

 The promenade is quite different ambiance depending on the season and day of week.You can see the contrast of this photo in late November and the one below in Summer.

 It can be very crowded in the summer months, especially July and August ( when we skip it and [Schengen shuffle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/05/what-is-schengen-shuffle-travel-how-to-do-it.html#more) out of [crowded, high season](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html), hot Europe).This photo was taken on a week day in June. The summer tourist explosion fades the rest of the months of the year, often leaving this beautiful sea path & town almost empty during parts of the day.

Sitges’ most famous son, Facundo Bacardi, epitomized the pioneering spirit when he founded his rum distillery in Cuba. They were called Americanos. Pictured here is the Casa Manuel Planas (1908), one of the finest examples of _americano_ architecture in Sitges. Amazing Caribbean and Mediterranean architectural combinations & why so many palm trees. More  than 60 "americano" houses are still standing near the fittingly named Carrer Illa de Cuba or “island of Cuba street”.

Artist Santiago Rusiñol helped turn Sitges into a haven for artists and intellectuals. He was a Spanish painter, poet, and playwright & was one of the leaders of the Catalan modernisme movement. Picasso, Dali and Miro hung out at his house.The three museums located along the waterfront – the Cau Ferrat Museum, the Palau de Maricel and the Maricel Museum are all tied to Santiago Rusiñol.He was instrumental in transforming Catalonia into an artist’s paradise. In 1893  when he set up his seaside Sitges studio, he said it was  “a hermitage by the sea, where all the pilgrims of the arts can go to take the waters of poetry and cure themselves of the hubbub of the city”. Today Sitges has one of the best Film Festivals, Carnivals and many exciting  art galleries.

Want to treat yourself to a first class meal at [one of the best restaurants](https://www.gaysitgesguide.com/restaurant/maricel/) in Sitges? [Maricel](https://maricel.es) is by far one of the top restaurants in Sitges and located in the heart of the town, facing the beautiful Fragata beach. It is more expensive than it's neighbors, but lovely if you are in the mood to splurge.They serve high end Mediterranean cuisine.   
  
  
That said, perhaps we should not have ordered the paella because we are very spoiled by a local friend from Valencia who makes the [best paella in the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/how-to-make-paella-in-spain-the-valencia-way-recipe-for-travel-foodie-lovers-of-traditional-food.html)!

Plus the ambiance with sea views, top service, good wine and high quality bread and oil also make it special.

Most of the restaurants along the beach and promenade seem good, we usually pick them at random by what we see as we pass by. The salads and sangria we had at [Restaurante Altamar](https://www.instagram.com/altamar_sitges/)  were enjoyable with beach view in the same area and moderately priced.

Even the train station in Sitges is charming and the Barcelona-Sitges line was only the second railway line built in Spain! There are 3 main stations in Barcelona from which to get to Sitges: Estacio de França, Passeig de Gracia, and Estacio Sants train stations. If you want to get there as quickly as possible, it can take as little as 36 minutes on the fastest services. It is a beautiful ride along the coast. Our friend made it fast and very easily, but then she is European & very experienced with train travel. Tickets from Barcelona to Sitges start from $8.93 when you book in advance. You can catch the Rodalies line R2S train from either Barcelona-Passeig de Gracia or Barcelona-Sants. You can't book online you just buy a ticket on the day at the station. Talk to them at the station or go online at the [Official Renfe website](https://www.renfe.com/es/en) to get more information.You can also take a bus, taxi or drive.

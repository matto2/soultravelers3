It's that time of year again, where I see many friends on Facebook graduating from college or their kids graduating and some dreaming about traveling. It is an exciting time full of hope and expectations ( although [scarier in this economy where college education is in melt down](http://blogmaverick.com/2012/05/13/the-coming-meltdown-in-college-education-why-the-economy-wont-get-better-any-time-soon/ "scary economy and meltdown of college education")).  I get emails from college graduates planning backpacking [trips around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html "trips around the world") (or [road tripping Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-europe-plan-then-improvise.html "road trip europe"))  asking for advice about travel. Quite sweet and I am especially happy that we give young women who love to travel hope for the future of traveling with kids.

**MY BEST ADVICE FOR A COLLEGE GRADUATE - 13 KEYS**  
  
  
  
**TRAVEL**  
  
Hmm, this is a bit of a no brain-er coming from a [family that has been traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family traveling the world") for the last 6 years ( 44 countries on 5 continents on $23/day per person), but seriously, travel enriches you like nothing else and there is no better time to do it.  
  
No money? Traveling is actually MUCH cheaper than most think, so if there is a will there is ALWAYS a way. Start saving wisely, live under your means, make travel a priority, start wth little adventures if you've never done it and need to build courage, check out wonderful free options like couch surfing ( like we did in [Bora Bora](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "Bora bora for cheap")) or volunteer like [WWOOFing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWOOF "WWOOF").  
  
By 23 I'd already taken a 6 month camping trip across the USA with a partner, gone to London, Amsterdam and Paris by myself plus Rio with a girlfriend on a very low budget. They set the tone of my life to go for freedom and adventure.  
  
Teaching English is a very easy way to actually get paid while exploring a whole new world like China, Thailand, Korea plus an opportunity to learn a new language at the same time and save money for more travel.  
  
I  like the Irish way of doing a [GAP year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year "Gap year") at 15, but it is never too late to travel and wise countries support GAP years and travel. Don't waste your precious travel time and money just partying, but connect with locals, learn a language, expand your mind and credentials for the global market.

**FOLLOW YOUR BLISS - DO WORK YOU LOVE**  
  
Be brave, follow your heart and shoot for the moon! Take those early years when you have the most energy and enthusiasm to go for the big dreams. Trust yourself and do the work required. Think out of the box, go after what you want, network and never be afraid to ask for help. Have passion and go after things like your life depends on it.  
  
"To find joy in work is to discover the fountain of youth." Pearl S. Buck  
 

**DREAM BIG - TRUST YOURSELF -RAMP AND PREPARE - TAKE CALCULATED RISKS**  
  
It is actually easier to go for the BIG dreams than just settling for something practical because less people are willing to commit fully to such, so there is less competition. Trust your passions and eliminate all doubts and negative self talk.  
  
Build a "ramp" to where you want to go. Keep your eye on the prize and work hard and smart. Be tenacious. Be prepared when opportunity knocks and make your own opportunities by taking calculated risks. Have a support plan as you ramp up and ideas for plan B,C,D,E etc. in case your first ideas don't work out as planned.  
  
**  
LIVE FRUGALLY AND MINIMALIST - AVOID DEBT**  
  
Avoid debt like the plague as it enslaves people. Cut up all or most of your credit cards and don't use them unless you pay the bills in FULL every month. You really DON"T need so much "stuff", it won't serve you or our planet, so THINK long and hard about every penny you spend. A [Mininimalist life](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist life") rocks, gives you more freedom and takes the addiction out of [consumerism](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "consumerism in america").  
  
DON"T fall into the standard traps that Goodman explains so well in her quote. REMEMBER that all people who retire early ...avoid debt and live under their means.  
  
"Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work and driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for - in order to get the job you need to pay for the clothes and the car and the house you leave vacant all day so you can afford to live in it." Ellen Goodman  
  
That doesn't mean you can't have that darling pair of shoes ( or whatever), it just means that you will have one great pair instead of 20, you might buy it second-hand but looks brand new, you will take care of it and use it for a long time to get your monies worth ( and maybe sell it on ebay or craigslist for more than you bought it for) etc...in other words, be a SMART consumer.  
  
Read the classic [Your Money or Your Life.](http://ymoyl.wordpress.com/ "your money or your life")

**SAVE FOR RETIREMENT NOW**  
  
Start socking away EARLY! Make it a priority and I'd put your savings in "thinking- out-of-the-box " places like precious metals, off shore, other currencies, tangible assets etc and never in big banks with all their corruption and the problems with the dollar. Make it a habit to do this every week.  
  
**MAKE THE BULK OF YOUR MONEY BETWEEN 20 AND 35**  
  
These are the best years to make money when you have the most enthusiasm and energy. Go for it in a big way and sock it away. Stay focused on money and career. If you are doing something you love, you will enjoy this phase as you make your mark on the world.  
  
  
  
**RETIRE EARLY - AIM FOR 30 OR 35**  
  
If you put your focus on making, saving, investing money from twenty to thirty five, when you have your most energy and career drive,  then most people can retire by 35. You can still work and just semi-retire if you'd like ( as I did at 38) , but you will have the freedom to spend more time with family raising a child, more time to travel with a mate or family, ability to work at some avocations or volunteer things that interest you.  
  
Read the Classic "Cashing in on the American Dream or How to Retire at 35" written by our friends who did exactly this over 25 years ago and still loving their lives.  
  
  
**HAVE KID/S LATE IN LIFE**  
  
There are many ways to " do family", but I prefer that my daughter waits until at least 35 to have a child because everything changes when you have a child. I don't really see the point of having a child or children if you don't have the time to spend with them and that is hard to do today wth two full-time working parents. I can't even tell you how fast the time goes once you have a child, so if you don't have family as the number one focus during those years, you will miss MUCH.  
  
My experience is life has different phases and if you give your all to your work/career from 20 to 35, you are ready for a change at that point. You also have much more to give to your child based on all the experience and maturity that you have accrued along the way, not to mention a growing nest egg to give your family financial security which grants you peace of mind.  
  
It is hard to do kid/s and a driven career at the same time, something has to give and neither gets the focus they need ( or one get's seriously neglected). Many women who do family first starting in their twenties, yearn for career success/validation in the second half of their life, but many careers need the drive of youth. Luckily, in today's world one can have both fulfilled fully,  if you do it in phases.

**THINK ENTREPRENEUR AND 4HOUR WORKWEEK**  
  
If you can't find a job, make your own, develop entrepreneurial skills. Even if you have a job, you might consider building your own entrepreneurial work on the side to ramp up to greater freedom at some point. The internet and tech makes it easier than ever to live life on your own terms and work whenever and where ever you want today.  
  
Musts for your reading list: ( And I am not just recommending them because we were case studies in both [4Hour Workweek](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/the-4hour-workweek-review-by-world-traveling-family-rich-global-digital-lifestyle-design.html "four hour work week") and The Art of Non-Conformity. These guys know their stuff and walk their talk and give the best blueprint on how to do this)

**DON'T WASTE TIME ONLINE - AVOID TIME SUCKS**  
  
As [digital nomads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomad") who live a paperless life, we are very dependent on the web as most people are today for everything from schooling options for kidlets, to managing our investments to talking to my Mom and friends. It is a wonderful tool, but make sure YOU are using the tools wisely, instead of it using you. Too many today are [addicted to thier smart phones](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/08/nomophobia-cell-phone-addictio_n_1500670.html "addicted to smart phones") and missing real life.  
  
Today, being unplugged is the greatest luxury, so make sure you purposely spend as much time as you can  offline and enjoying the real world, being truly present in the now, sharing intimacy face to face. Be efficient and focused when online and it IS addictive and time suck, so monitor closely, so you don't go unconscious as your life slips by or you [miss your child's growing years](http://www.handsfreemama.com/2012/05/07/how-to-miss-a-childhood/ "miss your child's childhood").

**MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES A PRIORITY**  
  
You are what you eat, so be very thoughtful and aware what you put in your body. It seems like you have forever when you are 20, but you will be amazed how quickly life slips by. [The healthier you eat](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "the healthier you eat") when young not only keeps you healthier, it supports your future children and your quality of life when you get older. Think generations ahead,not just instant gratification. Make good choices.  
  
**TO THINE OWNSELF BE TRUE - DON'T FOLLOW THE CROWD**  
  
It has been said in many ways, but the more you do this, the better your life will be. Each of us are unique and have come here for a reason, listen to your heart.  
  
**“The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.” — Friedrich Nietzsche**  
  
**KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO LIMIITS AND ALL DREAMS BEGINS WITHIN -SO "IMAGE-IN"  
  
**

"The only rules and limits are those we set for ourselves" - Tim Ferriss  
  
Don't ever put limits on your life, if you can dream it, you can do it. Shoot high. Sure, sometimes you might fall short, sometimes it takes many more years than you ever expected, sometimes it looks a bit different than originally planned, but if you don't go for your dreams at all, then they are sure not to happen.  
  
Spend time creating what you want INSIDE, as that is where it all begins. We are all far more powerful than we give ourselves credit for and I believe we are all co-creators with God. Spend time praying, meditating, visualizing, giving thanks, journaling, listening to your inner guidance, imaging-in what you want...every day.  
  
Then be willing to do all the work required and every time you fall ( and you will as that is part of life) get up and keep going. He wins who endures to the end.

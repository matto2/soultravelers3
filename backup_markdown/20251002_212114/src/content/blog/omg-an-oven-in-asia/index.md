 OMG! An OVEN in Asia!! ![IMG_6225](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017eeb3d7e3a970d.jpg)

I love my big kitchen in Asia  
and let me tell you that big  
kitchens are very rare in Asia

<!--more--> ![wow- a big, useful kitchen in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017eeb3d7f82970d.jpg)  
  
I love my big kitchen in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/asia/ "Asia travel") and let me tell you that big kitchens are VERY rare in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/weird-asia.html "weird Asia") and an oven is non existent in most [apartments](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/penang-apartment-or-condo-rental-plenty-of-choices.html "apartment rental penang") and homes. Most kitchens are tiny as [street food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "street food penang") is the name of the game here.[Cooking in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/cooking-in-china.html "Cooking in Asia") is done outside mostly.  
  
Remember when we used the toaster oven to bake cookies our first [Christmas in Asia.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/first-christmas-in-asia.html "Christmas in Asia")..we were thrilled and lucky to have even a toaster oven.  
  
![OMG! A real oven in Asia to bake in ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901c401e48970b.jpg)  
  
Most of you know we have been on an [organic eating](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic eating and travel"),[super healthy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "super healthy ") kick for [a bit](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health secrets"), addressing my [travel health issues](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "travel health issues - traveling when sick") and [curing cavites naturally](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "curing cavities naturally"). So when we decided to eat no grains for a while, we thought it was worth spending sixty bucks to buy an oven so I could cook yummy things made out of [coconut](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "how to make coconut milk kefir") flour that we could eat.  
  
I got one wth a super low heat too, so I could use it as a dehydrator for things like making my own coconut flour easily ( story coming) from the cheap and abundant [healthy coconut](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconut healthy") here.  
  
![yum! Paleo desert recipes coming!!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017eeb3da6e0970d.jpg)  
  
It's crazy! I may be the only one in [tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "winter home in southeast Asia") to have both a crock pot ( for [bone broths](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/how-to-make-nourishing-bone-broth-recipes-to-heal.html "bone broth how to make")) and an oven in my kitchen and both of them going almost every day. Actually, the crock pot is usually on at night.  
  
![blender, crock pot and spices](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017eeb3db1dd970d.jpg)  
  
So now we have invested in an oven, crock pot, blender and [juicer](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/juicing-and-health.html "juicing for health")..all cheap here and we can store them all with friends when we leave, so they will wait for our return.  
  
This is so not me, but I am loving cooking, baking, [fermenting](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-salsa.html "how to make lacto fermented salsa") delicious and  [super healthy](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "super healthy tips for travel") real food and my family is loving it. Mozart's [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html/ "world school homeschool and travel") now includes lots of cooking and baking too.  
  
![Mmmmm. Paleo banana bread fresh from the oven! Nom, nom](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017eeb3db985970d.jpg)  
  
We are all enjoying the homey feel to this place and getting healthier with good food.  
  
![bone broth soup](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901c4057f1970b.jpg)  
  
More recipes coming as I have time.  
  
![stunning sunset](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901c405bfe970b.jpg)  
  
I also love it that I get to experience the [specatacular sunsets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/sweet-sunset.html "spectacular sunsets and inspiration") here from my kitchen windows as it usually sets while I am making dinner. Sweet gift...just like the [gorgeous sunrises](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/spectacular-sunrise-and-quote.html "gorgeous sunrise and quotes") over the [Andaman Sea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/serene-azure-andaman-sea-1.html "Andaman sea") that start our day from our bedrooms.  
  
![I love my traditional kitchen, oven and crockpot..note the fermenting jar tops](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833019102368dd1970c.jpg)

The [World Health Organization](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/20/1065865472/omicron-holiday-travel-gatherings-restrictions-world?utm_term=nprnews&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=npr&utm_medium=social&fbclid=IwAR0TXt5SRsgRPidNH4MThoMDkqkHjOKpbGKkWkj62g5GwKTv8UKmz-j-LR4) is [urging people to cancel holiday events](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59714272) and travel to protect public health because the Omicron variant is spreading globally at astounding rates & Delta variant is still killing too. Dr. Fauci has [warned that Christmas travel would increase the spread of Omicron](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/19/us-covid-fauci-omicron-variant-raging-travel-risks) even including those who are vaccinated and have boosters, although those in most danger who have the highest rate of death by covid by far are the unvaccinated. I've had a [debilitating illness and traveled when sick](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html), so know how hard it can be!

The facts show us that -   
Unvaccinated: 451 cases per 100k  
Vaccinated: 134 cases per 100k  
Boosted: 48 cases per 100k  
  
We can see how fast  omicron is moving  through the data of one hospital system, in an affluent area of Texas: For months: delta is 100% of cases Dec. 8: hospital detects first omicron cases Dec. 12: omicron is 45% of cases Dec. 15: omicron is 82% of cases! n BC, Omicron cases more than doubled in 24 hours, from 135 on Thursday to 310 on Friday. Dr. Tom Frieden said "I've worked on infectious disease outbreaks for 30 years. I've NEVER seen anything like the speed of Omicron".  
  

"Initial omicron cases in Denmark have been concentrated disproportionately among people in their 20s — an age group whose infections might be missed by countries that test less. many countries could already be experiencing the same pattern, with the young — who are most likely to travel and socialize — jump-starting community spread." - Washington Post

Sadly, the United States—Already the Most COVID\-19-Infected Nation on Earth with 807,000 covid deaths and 51.2 Million cases and it seems we are about to See “Unprecedented and Exponential” Increase in COVID\-19 infections due to omicron, the unvaccinated are in the greatest danger, but even vaccinated Americans should now “Hunker Down” and reconsider holiday plans. The first to die from Omicron was an unvaccinated person who already had covid, so clearly there was no natural immunity.   
  
"With the new, highly transmissible Omicron variant detected in 39 states, many Americans are wondering whether to cancel holiday plans. MSNBC Medical Contributor Dr. Uche Blackstock says she’s no longer traveling for Christmas and predicts the U.S. will see an “exponential increase in cases over the next few days to weeks.” “I think we’re going to see something that we’ve never seen before in this pandemic, and I’m really worried,” Dr. Blackstock tells MSNBC’s Alicia Menendez."

I know we are all sick of Covid, but I am an optimist and think sooner than later the world will start working together to keep us all safe. I am looking forward to lots of International travel soon, but I will not be traveling with Omicron & Delta covid surging. I use to be a nurse in ICU so my heart goes out to all the over worked & stressed health care workers and all of those who are vulnerable and high risk for covid. Make wise choices and be safe this holiday season!!

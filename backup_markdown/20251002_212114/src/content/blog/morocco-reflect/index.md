We are certainly very glad that we came to this unique land and saw it’s fascinating sights, and met it’s warm people. I find it to be a haunting place and the memories of it grow fonder each day I am away. There is simply nothing like Morocco that I have found before and I see why people fall in love with it. I  
found it  enchanting, almost dream like at times with exciting smells and sights, archetypical images with amazing architecture and an ancient culture filled with creativity.

It is a very interesting combination of Arab culture, ancient Berber traditions and French sophistication from colonial days. It is also a very harsh land and the poverty, filth, decrepit buildings and utter chaos takes it’s toll, so we were as happy to leave as we were to come.

We will be back for more exploring in Morocco as there is so much to see. It is a timeless, mystical, magical place that is very romantic with some of the friendliest people in the world. We especially seemed to like the native Berber people with their dignity and graciousness, despite living in such inhospitable conditions.

I will not miss the well built roads in Morocco (that were built during colonization). I just read today that Morocco roads are considered the deadliest in the world. In the week we were there 933 people were injured and 8 killed in 707 road accidents. Reading such things before going probably added to my fear in  
the car, but honestly as bad as that is, I am surprised more are not killed.

We would probably drive when we returned, now that we know how it all works. That way we would be assured of having seat belts for everyone (hopefully, but then nothing is certain in Morocco). We would also spend more time outside of the cities and in the desert, although I would like to see Fez again and all imperial cities if I was shopping for a home or something. There were places we missed this time that we still want to see and now are less frightened by travel in Morocco.

There are so many intriguing images that hit you where ever you look in Morocco. It is really a photographers dream place with incredible light and colors. Too many to describe or get a picture of or upload, but here are a few that touched us to add to our list.

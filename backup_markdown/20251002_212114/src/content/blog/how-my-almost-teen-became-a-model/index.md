What pretty young girl doesn't dream about becoming a model? When I was sixteen, I was asked to model by a reporter for our local paper and ended up on the Sunday cover in color and half the front page.  
  
That eventually led to modeling in [San Francisco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/san-francisco-travel-why-we-love-it.html "San Francisco travel") and to a contract with [Ford Models](http://www.fordmodels.com/ "ford models"), in New York City, the largest and most prestigious modeling agency in the world. Through that, I  also worked for almost a year in [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/5-best-european-family-vacations.html "best europe vacations") based in Italy at a top sister agency, where I learned the ropes, built my portfolio, studied photography, fashion,  and discovered the [joy of world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/-around-the-world-travel-best-advice.html "joy of world travel").

That first job was shocking to me, out of the blue, totally flattering and gave me confidence. Now it seems it is my just-turned-twelve year old daughter's turn as she begins to blossom as an almost teen.  
  
With her pretty [long blond hair](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-diy-homemade-shampoo-and-creme-rinse-easy-cheap-healthy.html "DIY shampoo and long hair"), our [fashionista](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "fashionista world traveler") tends to get lots of attention no matter where we are when she is out ...even in [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/california-beach-new-years-day.html "california beach girl"), just walking with [her grandmother,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "traveling with grandma ") she has stopped traffic.

Because of this and being a Caucasian she was often treated like a [celebrity in China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/babies-in-beijing-china-travel-joy.html "modeling in china like a celebrity"), with people staring and wanting photos of her or with her, but when real modeling agency reps wanted her to model, she was startled and tickled pink. She was certainly happy that she was [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "fluent in mandarin learning in Asia") because they didn't speak any English!  It was our first day in Beijing and we had to go to the Apple store for a small problem and they came up to her with the modeling proposals.

She ended up in the local paper, but we were too busy on our [China Vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-family-vacation-beauty-love-joy-.html "china vacation") for many modeling jobs. She will be a little older when we return so we'll look into it more then because she wants to experience more of it. We emphasize heart and [brain focus](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "raising and homeschooling a gifted child through travel") in our family first and foremost, but creative expression  as well as beauty inside and out is also something to honor, enjoy and be grateful for.

One just never knows what can happen out of the blue on a [trip around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "trip around the world family traveling")! Our daughter made her [film debut](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/09/mozarts-film-de.html "film debut") in Croatia with Japanese star Maako, been [interviewed on BBC TV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/bbc-interviews-soultravelers3-on-social-media-and-travel.html "soultravelers3 interview on BBC about travel social media") in England, as well as [BBC world TV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/bbc-world-news-featured-soultravelers3-youtube-viral-travel-video-fast-track-bbcnews.html "bbc world tv soultravelers3 family travel")  another time, [Fox TV in Florida](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/soultravelers3-digital-nomad-family-on-fox-tv-.html "fox news digital nomad family"), Hong Kong TV and more.

I Believe in Me  
This is a beautiful and empowering book full of wonderful affirmations like "I love and care for myself", "I am one with all life" and "I turn within, and I am in peace". We have positive quality angel cards that we like to start the day with (picking one each) and Mozart likes to use this book in the same way. We often randomly pick a page without looking and use it as our affirmation for the day.

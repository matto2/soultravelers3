Mozart never met a bookstore she didn’t  
like, even if it is not even in English!  
She spots them from afar just like at home

Mozart never met a bookstore she didn’t like, even if it is not even in English! She spots them from afar just like at home and MUST take time to browse a bit. We have been hanging out at libraries and bookshops since she was a tiny baby as I do love them too and have become very fond of children’s literature since having a child and she has always loved books. I thought this was a particularly sweet one with a lovely hidden garden and play area just outside that Mozart discovered on our stroll around Brugge.

There were also a few other non-chocolatier windows and displays on our strolls that caught her attention that I thought you might like too. Plus her fun play with a kitten as we waited for a bus to the center and our little treat from the bakery.

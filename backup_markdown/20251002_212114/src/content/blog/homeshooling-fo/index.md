Homeschooling for Excellence  
This is an older classic about one of the pioneering homeschool families who sent 3 boys to Harvard who graduated at the top of their classes and how they raised and taught them on a homestead ranch. I like their attitude of following the lead of the child and like their subtitle "How to Take Charge of Your Child's Education and Why You Must".

**Happy Valentine's Day!** We were certainly stunned to find out that [Valentine's Day is **ILLEGAL** in Malaysia](http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/legal/general_news/no_valentines_day_for_muslims_jais.html "valentine's day is illegal in malaysia"). Wow! Who would have guessed that? I thought the only sin that Valentine's Day creates is it has become way too commercialized.

You CAN get Valentine cards and goodies here as my [visiting  mother](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "visiting mother multi-generational travel") bought the one in this photo above for our 10 year old yesterday at Gurney Plaza. [Most of  Asia is still celebrating Chinese New Year](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/family-travel-year-of-the-rabbit-in-asia-photos-chinese-new-year-.html "asia celebrating chinese new year"), so Valentine's Day takes a back seat in most of Asia and it's not mentioned in [our child's Mandarin school here in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "our child's madarin school in penang"). A few of the girls did bring candy to school for special friends in honor of Valentine's Day, but no one brought Valentines, nor was it an official celebration. Schools here have February 15th off for a Malaysian holiday, celebrating the birthday of Islam's Prophet Mohammad.

**WHY IS VALENTINE'S DAY ILLEGAL IN MALAYSIA?**  
  
If one looks closer though, it does make more sense. Malaysia is a Muslim country and Valentine's Day is originally about Saint Valentine, so even though most people don't think about it in those terms, it does have a Christian background. From the Muslim perspective, which made the law against Valentine's Day in Malaysia ( a 2005 [fatwa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatw%C4%81 "fatwa")), it seems it was because of this priest named Valentine who died on February 14th and became a Christian Saint also promoted war against Muslims.

So that is understandable. Not too many people would want to celebrate someone who wanted to kill you. Still a bit surprising because there seems to be much religious tolerance here. It doesn't seem to rule it against all Malaysians, but only for Muslims. They also seem to think that it promotes premarital sex for some reason, although I've read many rebuttals about this law even from the Muslim perspective, so it sounds like it remains a bit controversial even here.

[Chap Gog Meh i](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chap_Goh_Meh "Chap Goh Meh")s the traditional Chinese Valentine's Day and that is celebrated here in Penang by throwing oranges or tangerines into the sea. It's celebrated on the 15th day of Chinese New Year , is called [Night of Romance](http://www.penang-vacations.com/chap-goh-meh.html "night of romance") and is still popular in Penang.

Remember our [Chocolate Valentine from Germany](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/our-chocolate-valentine-in-kohn.html "Chocolate valentine in germany")?

Yum! Valentine's Day is always a good excuse for chocolate if nothing else. Grin.

**SHOULD WE CELEBRATE LOVE EVERY DAY?**

I am all for love, but not for commercialism or polarization so we celebrate Valentine's Day every day with a focus on love and do also make little  homemade cards with goodies for our daughter. My husband wooed me with his ability to make charming things like this wrapping paper and tiny card by hand and I still enjoy the fun of giving and receiving these little tributes to love. Needless to say, so does kidlet.

How do you celebrate Valentine's Day.... or do you?

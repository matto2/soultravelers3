**IS PUBLIC WIFI SAFE?**  
  
With so many free Wi-Fi hot spots around the world, from McDonald's and Starbucks to neighborhood cafes and campgrounds, the convenience makes it is easy to forget that it's not safe and you may be putting yourself and your computer at risk.  
  
**WHY YOU NEED A VPN FOR SECURITY**  
  
More and more people are using these handy public outlets at home and during travel abroad, without realizing the security risks because these free Wi-Fi options are unsecured networks. Today, hackers or anyone can take advantage with public Wi-Fi ( even those with elaborate passwords and screening) quickly stealing your data, passwords, account information and more.  
  
Fortunately, there is an easy way to keep your data private, safe and protected, whether you are using free Wi-Fi hot spots at home or any where in the world. For [world traveling, digital nomads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "world traveling digital nomads") like us who live a paperless, [minimalist](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist lifestyle"), travel  lifestyle, this is crucial.  
  
I am not a geek and know little on this topic, but it was effortless to find the best way to do this. Over and over again, from various experts I read that a high quality VPN was the single most important step to take to stay safe.  
  
  
"Perhaps the easiest - and most reliable - method for ensuring your use of a public wifi hotspot doesn't result in compromised data during your session is to use a known, respected commercial VPN service." Wired  
  

**WHAT IS THE BEST VPN AND WHY WITOPIA**  
  
Next, we researched which was the very best VPN to use. Again, over and over, we kept seeing the same answer..Witopia. It was voted the best and  most popular VPN service according to [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5761226/best-vpn-service-provider-witopia "lifehackers best vpn") readers. If you check out [Best VPN Reviews](http://www.vpnreviews.com/?p=84 "best vpn reviews"), you will find a plethora of raves from happy users from around the world, (many multi-year users, including plenty from China and other challenging countries) rating it 5 stars for reliability, price, speed and support.  
  
So 3 years ago we bought Witopia and loved it. Witopia VPN was one of our wisest choices in 6 years of travel. They have a great unconditional 30 day money back guarantee, truly amazing customer service with 24x7x365 live chat support and a fantastic, well-priced product that we have been very happy with. So happy, that two years ago we approached them about being sponsors for us as we thought it was a product our readers would enjoy too.  
  
A [family world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "a family world trip") or being a international road warrior can mean challenging Wi-Fi conditions like in [Paris,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/free-wifi-travel-office-paris-digital-nomad-technomad-minimalist-workshift-mobile-work-on-the-road.html "paris free wifi") London, Austrailia, [Dijon](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/laptop-madness.html "wifi madness in europe") ..often places you wouldn't expect it to be so slow, expensive or non-existent. Out of 44 countries on 5 continents, the USA has the best internet by far. The VPN works optimally when the connection signal has good stength and is consistent.

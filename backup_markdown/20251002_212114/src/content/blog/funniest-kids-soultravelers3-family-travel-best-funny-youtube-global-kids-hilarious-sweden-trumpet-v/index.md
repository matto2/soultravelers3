Family travel can be a [route to world peace,](http://www.worldpeacepassport.com/index.html) giving children opportunities to truly become [global citizens](http://www.education.com/magazine/article/Going-Global-Citizens-of-the-World/) and we're grateful that [soultravelers3 can help educate kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/sahara-dream.html#more) about [customs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/little-pilgrims.html#more) and [cultures](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/08/kalehan-kindred.html#more) from  [around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/where-in-heaven.html#more) in a fun way. We know that this will have lasting value for our child, but hope that by sharing [our story](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) we can share the value of global citizenship (whether one can travel or not)  which enriches all our lives and can lead to better cooperation and understanding for generations to come.

One American girl plus one [Swedish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/family-travel-photo-absolut-ice-bar-in-stockholm-sweden.html) boy, add a full sized trumpet, a small violin, a warm fire, and lots of joy for an unforgettable, spontaneous concert to remember always. This hilarious Youtube video that we took while visiting [Sweden](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-sweden-stockholm-harbor-boats.html) demonstrates the joy and laughter that two children from two countries who do not even share a language can have together through the bridge of music, humor and love. In 30 seconds, I think it tells the story of the importance and thrill of connecting through family travel and how these kinds of memories leave lasting impressions. Mozart will forever have two wonderful Swedish brothers!

It truly is such a small world after all and the internet makes it smaller each day. I met this beautiful Swedish family by chance over the internet and formed a deep friendship only online for many years before the children were born and before we decided to take our world tour. Our time with them was one of the highlights of our global journey as they shared their boundless love, beautiful Swedish countryside home, and many joyous Scandinavian customs and traditions with us from [Crayfish parties](http://twitpic.com/85rf) to [Kota huts.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/family-travel-photo-sweden-reindeer-meat-in-kota-traditional-sami-lapland.html)

So many amazing stories and [photos](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/family-travel-photo-sweden-pets-cats-children-travel-photography.html) yet to tell about our blissful, idyllic Swedish summer soiree! This is just a taste!! Tell me about your special family travel memories with your kids or from your own childhood and how it still enriches you today.

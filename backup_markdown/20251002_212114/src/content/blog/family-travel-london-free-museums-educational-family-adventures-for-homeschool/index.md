[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) is [all about education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html) and there are always many opportunities to learn while on a [road trip around Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html). Visiting museums is a great way to [add to the educational values as you wander the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html). We absolutely loved the [Natural History Museum in London](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/) which was wonderful and engaging for the whole family. To top it off the museums are free in London! We also loved visiting the [Tate Museum](http://www.tate.org.uk/) after seeing the [Globe Theatre](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html).  
  
We use museums as part of our [long term travel education and homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html) as we tour the world slowly. This one was particularly nice because they had a section in the basement that was meant for kids to explore in a hands-on, scientific way. There were microscopes, computers, magnifying glasses, and more,Â  plus teacher volunteers that were fabulous at assisting a child to get the most out of their child led experience. Don't you love this kind of learning?

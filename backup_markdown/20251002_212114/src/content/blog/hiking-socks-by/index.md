Hiking Socks by Smartwool  
We all started with one pair of these socks when we left in 2006 and they are still like new (except for Mozart's as we some how lost hers along the way). They are terrific and worth the money, but get them on sale if you can. They help prevent blisters, are warm when it is cold and cool when it is warm. Many trekkers swear by them and now we know why!

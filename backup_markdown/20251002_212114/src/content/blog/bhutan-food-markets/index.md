We found the food markets fascinating in [Bhutan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan "Bhutan"). This photo is of a small one in the central part of the country, but we also loved the huge market in Thimpu and every small one we explored. There were many things we had never seen before and I will write a detailed report later.  
  
When most people think of [going to Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/travel-to-bhutan-.html "going to Bhutan") they think of the [Tiger's Nest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/tigers-nest-in-paro-bhutan.html#more "tiger's nest"), the [happiest place on earth](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/bhutan-happiest-place-on-earth--1.html "happiest place on earth"), [nomads](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-travel-bhutan-nomads.html "nomads"), [Bhutan Buddhism](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/buddhist-bhutan-bliss.html "Buddhism in Bhutan") or a [special vacation](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/family-vacation-in-bhutan.html "speical vacation in Bhutan") in this specacular, rarely seen and pristine country.  
  
People don't tend to [go to Bhutan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/bhutan-vacation-facts-and-myths.html "go to bhutan") for [Bhutanese cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutanese_cuisine "Bhutanese cuisine") or the markets, but we really enjoyed both. One learns much about a people through their food and markets. They love hot and spicy food and the national dish is called Ema Datshi which is cheese and chilis. I especially enjoyed the organically grown buckwheat pancakes, the organic potatoes and the many soups.  
  
Do you like visiting markets when you travel?Â  Whether they are big [markets like in San Sebastian](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/food-shopping-san-sebastian-spain-unusual-markets-europe.html "food markets in San Sebastian"), fish [markets like trying whale in Norway](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/family-travel-photo-norway-bergen-fish-market-fresh-salmon.html "food market eating whale norway"), or a [little market in the Cotswold](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-food-market-fruit-foodie-red-current-.html "food market cotswold england") country side in England, or the south of France or even [picking our own in Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-italy-verona-farm-stay-agritourismo-romeo-juliet-arena-opera.html "picking grapes italy")...we are always up for food markets.  
  
Food markets make for great fodder in a [world school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world school") life, don't you think?

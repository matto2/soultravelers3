Have you always wanted to take your kids on the Polar Express? If your [kid is a reader](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/10-tips-to-raise-a-reader-book-lover.html "How to raise a reader"), you love the book & movie. We did a [winter road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/winter-road-trip-americas-southwest-.html "winter road trip usa") to the [Grand Canyon](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/grand-canyon-family-adventure.html "grand canyon family adventure") last year and loved it.

The most popular time for the Grand Canyon Railroad, located in Williams, Arizona on [historic Route 66](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/historic-route-66-.html "historic route 66 travel tips"),  is when the  [Polar Express](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGejMmr5G6c&feature=player_embedded) runs From Nov. 7th to Jan. 3rd.

When we stayed at the Grand Canyon Railroad Hotel, last January, [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/03/mozart-beautiful-teen-singer-songwriter-musician.html "Mozart teen singer and songwriter") was thrilled to see the photos in the elevator, as she is a big fan of the touching book by Chris Van Allsburg and movie.

Then seeing the Polar Express train was even more exciting!

Amazingly, 1/3 of the Polar Express tickets are gone by summertime. But you can start planning for next Christmas! Reserve your tickets [online](https://secure.thetrain.com/reserve/polar/) first. You can buy a package deal  or individual train tickets.

Alas, we just missed the time period for the Polar Express, but did thoroughly enjoy our train trip from Williams, Arizona into the Grand Canyon and will be writing more about that.

It was a lot of fun and winter is a great time to go as it is the least crowded in January after the Polar Express! I've been several times before and found this time period the most magical!

Our stay at the [Grand Canyon Railway Hotel](http://www.thetrain.com/lodging/the-grand-canyon-railway-hotel/ "grand canyone railway hotel") was also a delight! So if you are looking for a Polar Express or the best time to see the Grand Canyon during a [winter road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/road-trip-usa-best-of-the-west.html "road trip usa"), either way, you will have an unforgettable experience!  
  
We were blessed to be hosted by the [Grand Canyon Railway](http://www.thetrain.com/ "grand canyon railway"),  [Grand Canyon Railway Hotel](http://www.thetrain.com/offers-packages/ "Grand Canyon railway hotel")  and the [Kachina Lodge](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/kachina-lodge-410.html "Kachina Lodge at Grand Canyon"), and all were absolutely amazing and very family friendly & Boomer friendly!

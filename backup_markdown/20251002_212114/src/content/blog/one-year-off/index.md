One Year Off  
This is one of the first books we read about a traveling  
family going around the world and it got us excited  
about the possibilities for our own family trip.  
They even took a nanny! Later we read a college paper  
by one of the children who is now grown,Â  stating how  
much this experience had a profound impact on her life  
in many positive ways. If you are considering a family  
trip around the world or exotic family travel,  
this is a good read!

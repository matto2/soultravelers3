The day after the birthday/bon voyage/slumber party we had to head up to San Francisco for a few quick errands and took a little time to sight see in our favorite city and say good bye and have a last supper with one of our regular restaurants with a view. Ms Mozart’s “best friend” Ms L came with us and it was a fun day. I once lived in the center of the City and we visit often, but I could not help but think of all the places

I have yet to show Ms. Mozart. A part of me wanted to run around and see them all, but of course that  
was unrealistic. Funny how ones’ mind works when you are about to take off in a big way. Life becomes somewhat bittersweet and more precious. Instead we just took it easy, soaked in the beauty and know we will return someday.

Ms L has an obsession with Paris at the moment due to her part French lineage, so she will probably join us at some point on the trip. We always have fun together as they have known each other since Ms. Mozart was in my womb and are each others’ surrogate sister.

When we dropped her off, we stopped in at my Mom’s house for a last goodbye and a short visit with two favorite aunts who were RVing at a nearby beach.They were camping up in Bodega Bay so had missed the party, but brought along the perfect little presents for Mozart a small pink jump rope and travel kite that were greatly appreciated and packed away instantly. It was great to see them and give them a hug goodbye as they have always been special people in our lives.

Not anyone who read my [top 10  most romantic cities](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/top-10-most-romantic-cities-.html?utm_content=bufferc0e9b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=pinterest.com&utm_campaign=buffer) list who has been dreaming of a trip! By the way, did you know [Valentine's Day is illegal in Malaysia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/happy-valentines-day-omg-its-illegal-in-malaysia.html)? 

Usually they are on different weekends, so this year makes it trickier to do a [romantic weekend away](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/romantic-winter-getaway-santa-fe.html), but if there is a will, there is a way! My [top 6 romantic places to celebrate Valentine's Day](http://soultravelers3new.local/2016/02/6-places-to-celebrate-valentines-day-around-the-world.html)? Tahiti, Santa Fe, Paris, Key West, Brugge or Venice!!

I took these photos of our [singer/songwriter/actress](https://www.heavenlyreyna.com) daughter [Heavenly Reyna](https://www.twitch.tv/heavenlyreyna) on two Valentine's Day before Covid started and the joy of those moments still makes me smile. Now, she just turned 21, is in her first apartment, bought her first car and we empty nest parents are planning long term travel a continent away in Europe. Time flies when you are having fun!

And spring has sprung here with sunny days, yesterday it was a balmy 84f/29C!

But I am not into sports & my husband [@garreynadesign](https://www.garreynadesign.com) was rooting for the  
SF 49ers ( our home team since we are from northern Ca), so that gives us full reign to focus on love and Valentine's Day. We will probably catch those famous super bowl commercials at some point to enjoy the creativity.

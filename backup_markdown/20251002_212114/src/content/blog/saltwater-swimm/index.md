Saltwater Swimming!  
July 13, 2007

Jumping off the sailboat into the extra buoyant, very salty sea is  
part of the joy of a “Blue Cruise” and done many times during  
each day at innumerable stunning and pristine private stops.

Jumping off the sailboat into the extra buoyant, very salty sea is part of the joy of a “Blue Cruise” and done many times during each day at innumerable stunning and pristine private stops. The water is a perfect temperature, refreshing but never cold or too warm and so very clear. The sea truly is turquoise here as you can see in some of the pictures, but there were other hues as well from a rich sapphire to deep emerald.

It was Mozart’s first experience swimming in an open sea and the extra salty water caught her a little by surprise. The strong taste and sting for the eyes, kept her from doing her usual crawl, as keeping the head out became the priority. She became a noodle aficionado like the rest of us.

I, of course, took the nice stairs to the waters edge, but Mozart wasted no time copying the big boys jumping off the top of the ship which was a good ways down, but dad (or me) were always close by. What a feeling and image of complete freedom!

Sometimes she and her father would go off exploring some of the islands at a good distance away. Sometimes they would swim a long span to a sandy shore and explore a new beach. Her father was a world class swimmer and star athlete and she seems to be following that lead with her adventurous spirit and natural athleticism. I enjoy capturing some of their adventures on film and love to watch them having fun together. She is unaware of how lucky she is to have so much daddy time and a life that is one endless vacation as it is just normal life for her.

The water was so clear that we could see whole schools of little fish go by and Mozart liked that. I took some pictures of them, but I don’t think my camera can capture them well for this medium. She thrilled at the opportunity to swim around with them.

The area where we can obviously stand in the water is suppose to be one of the most famous and beautiful beaches in Turkey near Oludeniz, called the Blue Lagoon. I am not sure what the thrill is at it was not one of our favorite places since it was not as private as most of the places we went, but we managed to enjoy our visit there and now at least know what the experience is like.

It is not unusual to see women fully dressed with scarf and long sleeves and long Turkish pants in the water fully clothed as this tends to be a resort where many of the locals like to swim. Actually, I am not sure one would call it swimming as it is more sitting in water to get cool from the heat.

In Greece one can find beaches where naked men and women of all sizes sit next to people in bathing suits (and some topless women). In Turkey it is even odder, women fully clothed and scarfed swim next to people in the tiniest, revealing thong bikinis. Make no mistake about it either, some of the women in the tiny bikinis are from Turkey too. It is a country full of contrasts and surprises.

The sea is known to be very still in these waters but we did run into some very rough seas the first day and half the boat got seasick including Mozart on the way to the Blue Lagoon. Luckily she bounced back immediately and she rarely vomits so finds it a fascinating experience. Unfortunately, an Australian woman on board did not recover for days until they finally found her some dramamine. We could have missed the rough seas entirely, but two on our boat insisted on seeing the Blue Lagoon.

Some days we would start the day with a swim before breakfast and some days we swam in the moonlight. There is something very relaxing about bobbing along and swimming in the Turkish riviera and rinsing off with the cold fresh water afterwards wakes one up!

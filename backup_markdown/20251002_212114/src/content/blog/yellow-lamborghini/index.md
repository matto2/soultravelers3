This [beautiful yellow Lamborghini](http://www.lamborghini.com/en/welcome/ "beautiful lamborghini") from [Italy,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/family-travel-italy-verona-opera-carmen-aida-domingo-zeffirelli-family-friendly-educational-travel.html "Italy travel") didn't really impress my little girl, but her father really enjoyed the gorgeous design. There is no doubt, that one thing the [Italians are good](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/08/colors-of-italy.html "Italian colors") at is great style and as a designer, DaVinci has an eye for such things and picked me up on our first date in his classic Porche.Â   
  
We won't be buying a [Lamborghini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini "lamborghini") any time soon, as we are much too practical and poor hubs sold his classic Porche after we got married and started a focus on parenting. There is a time and season for everything and we'd rather [travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "travel the world") than [invest in "stuff"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "over consumerism stuff") now. But, we do enjoy window shopping and happened to just stumble into these at a car show at one of our [malls in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "foreigner living in Penang").

Fun to see that men and boys ( mainly) drool over these things around the world, although we see more motorcycles than anything here and inexpensive Malaysia-made cars on the street. We've become fond of the mass transit buses here with wifi and air condition or walking to experience place at ground level.  
  
What do you drive?

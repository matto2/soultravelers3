Have you traveled the Romantic Road in Germany? Checkered with sunflowers, castles, vineyards and multi-colored autumn trees, the ["Romantische Strasse"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_Road)  is "one of the most scenically beautiful" according to [Frommers.](http://www.frommers.com/destinations/theromanticroad/0826010001.html)

[The Romantic Road](http://www.germany-tourism.de/ENG/destination_germany/master_tlfstrasse-id44.htm) was [a trade route](http://goeurope.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ/Ya&sdn=goeurope&zu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.colmberg.germany-castles.net%2Froad-map-castle-road%2F) during the middle ages and still retains the same charm of that time as it weaves along the western border of Bavaria. We delighted in discovering [so many beautiful sights](http://www.romanticroad.com/) during our stay in this area last October (after the masses of tourists have gone home). I have much more to write about this stunning  area and will be doing so soon. Many say it is quintessential Germany!

I took this picture on the road from  [Nordlingen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%B6rdlingen) to [Dinklebuhl](http://www.dinkelsbuehl.de/ISY/index.php?call=englisch) as we drove in our RV. I really love [sunflowers](http://www.jstait.addr.com/sunflowers/info.htm), don't you? We have seen them in Italy, Turkey, Spain and France, but some how they caught me by surprise this late in the season in Germany.

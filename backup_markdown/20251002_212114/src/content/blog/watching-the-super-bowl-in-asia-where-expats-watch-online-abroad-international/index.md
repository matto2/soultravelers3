While most of America is focused on the [Super Bowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl "super bowl"), most of Asia could care less as it is [Chinese New Year](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwbU_OGfSQg "Chinese New Year in Asia") here which is a huge holiday that lasts 15 days. All the people in [Malaysia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "Penang Malaysia") have been on vacation this past week and all of the schools, including our [10 year old daughter's Mandarin high school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "10 year old in Mandarin high school in asia"), are off this week. Even European expats don't care about the Super Bowl as it's not as popular with the world  as their football like we watched this past summer in [Barcelona when Spain won the World Cup.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/watching-spain-win-the-world-cup-in-barcelona-celebrations-fifa-football-fever-europe-travel-resort.html "barcelona when they won the world cup")

**BENEFITS OF WORLD TRAVEL**

One of the fabulous things about our [5 year open ended family world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "open ended family world trip") is that my very athletic husband who use to love sports like any all American boy, really could care less today. We've just gotten out of the habit of following them and other things take priority. They also happen at odd times overseas, so it's not quite the same getting up in the middle of the night to watch a game live. Our one American neighbor in Spain  did do that with satellite tv, but it never seemed worth it to DaVinci.

**WHERE TO WATCH SUPER BOWL ONLINE ABROAD**

The Super Bowl kick off takes place very early Monday morning here in Penang... at dawn, so we'll not pay too much attention to it, but if you are in Asia or abroad and interested here are a few possibilities:

 **LIKE THE COMMERCIALS?**

 I always like the commercials best, but they will be online. Here is a sneak preview of the [Super Bowl commercials](http://superbowlads.fanhouse.com/ "super bowl commercials")  for those who can't wait.

We're not attached to either team. Who do you want to see win? Will you watch the game?

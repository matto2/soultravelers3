 What is it like in Asia? What is it like in Malaysia? What is it like in [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/penang-at-night.html "Penang at night")?  
  
People who have never been to Asia, often ask us that and it is hard to explain, because it is a land of great contrast. [Living in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/living-in-asia.html "living in Asia"), is extremely different in many ways than [living in the USA](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "california beach town") or in [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "wintering in spain"). [Chinese tradtional culture](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/the-beauty-of-traditional-chinese-culture.html "chinese traditional culture") is dominant in [UNESCO World Heritage Site Georgetown](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "UNESCO world heritage site georgetown penang"),  Penang, especially as parents with a [child in a Mandarin school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "child in Mandarin school in Penang, Malaysia, Asia"). But Malaysia is very much a land of three cultures ( Indian, Malay and Chinese) and that is part of what makes it interesting here.  
  
Our life in our [luxury condo rental in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "luxury condo rental penang") is very different than out on the streets. This photo shows the typical local style of Malaysia. People make a business out of anything here and it is common to see a whole portable business contained in a motorbike ( like a mini-restuarant or store). Wandering the streets here, seeing it at ground level, is always intriguing.  
  
The traffic is horrendous in most of Asia and that is very true of Penang and cross walks are all but unheard of, so one crosses the street at their own risk. I've witnessed more accidents here than I ever have in my life ( 2 from my terrace facing a street with no traffic!) and most involve motorcycles.  
  
Walking the streets of Asia is a trip and here is a peek for you!

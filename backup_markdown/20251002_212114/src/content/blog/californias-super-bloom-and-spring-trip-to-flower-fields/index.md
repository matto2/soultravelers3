This [California spring](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/spring-fever-flowers-in-bloom.html "spring fever california super bloom") has erupted in a [super bloom](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/beautiful-butterfly-flowers-and-family-travel.html "butterflies and flowers") of wildflowers that paints the landscapes with vivid color from the sea to the mountains, thanks to the record rainfall that has ended the drought. So of course, we had to use spring break staycation time to [road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/road-trip-usa-best-of-the-west.html "road trip isa") and explore the spectacular beauty.

 We first notice them on the undulating hillsides on our way to Malibu in mid-March. Spring in southern California comes early and is always a delight with bright green foliage, yellow and orange flowers backed by the azure sea, but this year was extra special. Some say there hasn't been a super bloom like this for two decades.

 The iconic orange/gold California poppy is the state flower and an unmatched symbol for the Golden State.  In years of drought they disappear, but when there is rain they spread the valleys and hillsides with color.

 "Super Bloom" is a term used for an explosion of wildflowers that happens to bloom in mass at the same time and that happens about once a decade in California due to drought and winter rain patterns.

Kids' Travel Vest (carseat replacement)  
This is a fantastic choice for travel for a kid that needs to be in a car seat or booster seat. Mozart was only 30lbs. when we left, so we were thrilled to find this solution.  
It works great in our RV as well as in cabs or rental cars. Takes up little space and is very light. We even hauled it around Morocco in our day pack!

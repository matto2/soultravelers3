You might have guessed by now that we have fallen madly in love with [Andalusia's many charms](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/andalusian-hors.html "Andalusia horses"). It's been wonderful to spend time here over 5 years. When we returned to Spain this May we realized how much we missed it. This photo was taken at our campsite near [our favorite white village](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/our-village.html "Our favorite white village in Spain") and I like it for the memories in stirs in me despite the pretty blue flowers being out of focus.  
  
I have written before about [southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "southern spain"), [Andalusia spa's and Arab Baths](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/ahh-arab-baths-andalusia-spa-malaga-granada-benalmedena-massage-hotspringsthemal-water-roman.html "Andalusia spas and arab baths"), [family tips for Costa Del Sol](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "family tips for costa del sol") , [Rock of Gilbralta](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/rock-of-gibraltar-family-holiday-trip-guide-family-trave-tips-information-from-costa-del-sol-spain.html "Rock of Gibraltar")r and even [how to winter in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "how to winter in Spain"). Loads more of course as I never tire of this subject and we know it well.  
  
I suppose I am getting a bit nostalgic because our time in Spain will soon be up for this year.Â  We will miss sweet Espana as [we travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family travel the world"), but we will be back.

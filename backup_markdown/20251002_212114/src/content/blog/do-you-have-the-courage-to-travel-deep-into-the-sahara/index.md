Do you have the courage to [travel deep into the Sahara](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/les-nomades-sah.html#more "best travel experience in the Sahara")? When we took 6 year old [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/trilingual-mozart-travel-kid-expert-speaks-at-gec-about-world-education.html "Mozart travel expert teen") on a [camel trek overnight trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/sahara-rainbow.html#more "camel trek into the sahara") deep into [the Sahara](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/sahara-violin-c.html#more "mozart plays violin deep in the Sahara service project") ( by land - ie bus, ferry, train, car [from Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/long-day-into-a.html#more "Europe to Morocco  - long day journey")) we felt very adventurous as it's not something done by most American travelers.

We [did have fear](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/can-you-travel-with-fear-of-flying-vertigo-claustrophobia-and-agoraphobia.html "fear and travel "), especially doing it [with a young child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "why travel with kids"), but focused on our courage.

It turned out to one of our best choices on [our world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing family world tour"), that we all still remember well and cherish, even [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/12/mozart-sings-youre-not-alone-on-the-radio-possibly-a-movie.html "Mozart singer/songwriter teen"), because it was such a totally exotic and unique experience.

Mozart was also thrilled to do a service project of riding in on a camel, bringing a bag of healthy treats and playing her violin for kids who had never seen one! They happily greeted her singing songs, so it was simply magical.

So I write this to encourage you to face your fears when it comes to travel and see this amazing country and the world's largest subtropical desert, as these type of one-of-a-kind places are disappearing in our world that is shrinking and becoming more homogenized.

[Morocco](http://soultravelers3new.local/morocco/page/3/ "travel tips for Morocco") and [the Sahara Desert](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/wilderness-lodg.html#more "best lodging in Merzouga in the Sahara") are like no where else on the planet, so it is worth going just for that reason.

French and Arabic are the main languages, thus there is not much English spoken, so that adds to the challenge.  
  
![6 year old Mozart on a camel in Morocco](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301b7c74389a0970b.png)  
  
There will be challenges, but it is worth the effort and part of what makes it special.

We like to get off the beaten path and get to know the locals, as we feel to really get to know a country, one needs to interact with it's people.

Through a travel friend & [Morocco](http://soultravelers3new.local/morocco/page/2/ "morocco travel tips") expert I met on the internet, [Joao Leitao](http://www.joaoleitao.com/ "Joao Leitao"), we met the amazing Hmad and [Alessandra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/alessandra.html#more "Alessandra from Morocco Sahara tour company") at [Les Nomades](http://nomadsaharabivouacmerzouga.com/bivo
uac-morocco.html "excursion in Morocco in the Sahara") that helped us get a very authentic, heartfelt ( & safe) experience of the [Sahara and it's people](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/04/children-of-the.html#more "the Sahara and it's people and children").

Do gather your courage, do your research and head for this country and the Sahara. Done well, it can be a life changing experience that you will cherish forever! Any questions?

[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html) on our [amazing road trip through Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html) is often times just about enjoying the country side and small villages as one roams along the back roads in countries like [Slovenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia).  When you are on a new road in a new country there is just something about the unknown that brings out one's curiosity. [Slovenia](http://www.slovenia.info/?lng=2) is known as the greenest country in Europe and has it's own unique charm. I always find it interesting, that when one crosses a country border in Europe, somehow there is a different feel and look to the new country.

The roads and views are fantastic in Slovenia and besides spending time in [beautiful Lake Bled](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/beautiful-lake.html#more) and [lovely Ljubljana](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/lovely-ljublija.html), with [fun family travel moments](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/08/sand-city-in-lj.html#more), we have driven across Slovenia quite a few times between Italy and eastern Austria. Slovenia is a quite popular destination for European travelers, but sadly, most Americans miss this gem.

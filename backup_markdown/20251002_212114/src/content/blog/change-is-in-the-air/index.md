You might have noticed I've taken a bit of a blog vacation of late and I must say it has been wonderful for all of us. You know that on our [ultimate family adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate family adventure") we love the [luxury of unplugging](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "unplugging luxury") and [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel benefits"), always [avoiding travel burnout](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/how-to-prevent-travel-burnout.html "avoiding travel burnout").  For us, more than anything, this [trip around the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/8-reasons-for-a-family-world-trip-international-vacations-holidays-abroad-longterm-travel-rtw.html "family trip around the world") is about freedom, love and time together.  
  
![American girl exploring Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017eea901a0f970d.jpg)  
  
I have been writing this blog as we've [traveled the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/-around-the-world-travel-best-advice.html "round the world trip best advice") for over seven years, which is VERY old in blog years and VERY old for a [world traveling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing family around the world travelers") RTW [digital nomad lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "digital nomad lifestyle"). No one was doing this when we began and I had no idea that we would be doing this so long or I'd write this much. Time really does fly when you are having fun, but we are very different today than when we began. Mozart is no longer a five year old and we've been blessed to experience so much of this planet together, so we're very much at home in the world ( no matter how odd it is sometimes).  
  
I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with [blogging](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/top-travel-bloggers-of-2013-soultravelers3-wins-.html "blogging soultravelers3 wins"), I love to share and inspire, but I don't always care for the time it takes. Like most things online, there is always more to do. I am always trying to find that perfect balance of doing just the right amount that I enjoy and makes our readers happy. I wrestle with myself to do less, but I'm a creative type with lots of passions and enthusiasm for life, so it is not uncommon for me to bite off more than I can chew.  
  
Recently, catching kidlets reading classics obsession, I borrowed and reread her David Copperfield ( Dickens favorite book and some what autobiographical).Since it was written in 1849 ( and still so good!) it kind of amazed me that he found as his fame as a writer grew, it just gave him more work and more mail to answer. Of course, I will never be a Dickens ( one of my heroes) or a famous writer, but I can see how that still works today and why I wouldn't want to be a famous writer or biggest blogger.

Writing or blogging was never on my list of things to do in life. I [retired early to travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retire early and travel") and am now 61, so I only want to do fun things that I love. One of the reasons, I pulled back on [the book publishing deal](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html "soultravelers3 book New York Times") I was offered, was thoughts of the book tour and other things that would go with it. Having gone down that kind of rabbit hole with my acting career, I am more hesitant now and have different views on what success is and for me, that's about family now first and foremost, free time and freedom to do as I please.

No one else is doing [extended travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/06/how-to-do-exten.html "extended travel") or family world travel [with a piano](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/12/pool-play-piano.html "travel with a piano") and [violin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "violin around the world"), focused on [education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html/ "world school education and travel") with [monolingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html "growing up bilingual") parents [raising a fluent trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "how to raise a multilingual kid")/[triliterate](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/multilingual-learning-reading-in-3-languages.html "reading in several languages for bilingual and multilingual kids") [global kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "global kid").

**GRATITUDE**  
  
We really appreciate our steady readership and the many beautiful emails we get daily from those who have been touched and inspired by our journey. We never expected that as part of our [around-the-world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "around the world family trip"),  but it's been a blessing to share what we learn along the way. We are so grateful for the many amazing heart-focused folks we've met, both online and in person, thanks to this blog.  
  
I still have tons to share and have many half done blog posts waiting in the queue. Since it takes much longer to write about than actually do, I have only written about and shared photos and [videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 videos") of about 1% of our travels. So much to share, so little time..if I also want a free life.  
  
**WORLD SCHOOL CHANGES**

Our primary reason for being [in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/escaping-winter-in-tropical-asia.html "escaping winter in Asia") is to help our child become [fluent in Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/global-citizens-spanish-and-mandarin-immersion.html "fluent in Mandarin"), so she has been going to a [Chinese school in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Chinese school in Penang") as well as a recent dip into a [Chinese school in Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/learning-mandarin-in-beijing-china-best-school.html "best Mandarin Chinese school in Beijing") ( similar to what we did in [Spain for language immersion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "spain school language immersion")).  
  
We were so proud when she recently won the [Chinese Elocution trophy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "Chinese elocution contest inspiring ted talk") at her Chinese High School in Asia (the first time a Caucasian won it in the 63 year history of the 1000-kid school).  
  
That and our [trip to China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/china-travel-20-interviews-soultravelers3-part-1.html "trip to China"), helped us realize that we are almost complete with her [Mandarin fluency](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "Mandarin immersion") goals, so we decided to take a hiatus from the school for now. If you know Chinese you can see that she has come a loooooong way between this video taken when we arrived and her latest. Her Mandarin reading and writing is even more impressive and we are grateful that we started this [growing up trilingual](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html "growing up bilingual or trilingual") in the womb.  
  

<iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JDe6pgl-qCg?rel=0" width="420"></iframe>

  
  
There have been great things learned through the school (besides [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "learning Mandarin in Asia")) from [Chinese cultural immersion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/chines.html "chinese cultural immersion tea ceremony") to [life long friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "lifelong friends"), chorus, [environmental education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/environmental-education-world-school-kid.html "environmental education"), [performing,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/chinese-school-trophy-girl-.html "performing winning ") winning a singing contest, finding her talent for [public speaking](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "kid public speaking winner"), becoming a monitor, new organization skills, discovering her leadership potential, skipping from 4th grade to 7th grade, devouring the library, [being interviewed](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/american-student-chinese-view.html "American kid interviewed chinese school"), Asian tutors,[being different](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/being-different-its-a-good-thing.html "being different is a good thing"),  [physics,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "physics in Mandarin chinese school") Algebra, Geometry etc in Mandarin, learning to be a test taker,  lots of autonomy starting at 10 in a large,  33 acre high school campus and much more.  
  
She is an impressive kid who has thrived/risen to the top in a very challenging environment and it has strengthened and enriched her as well as adding unique experience to her one-of-a-kind life. We are very proud that she took it from everyone  staring at her on the [first day at her school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "American girl in Chinese school in Asia"), ( she was the only Caucasian) to winning 3 trophies and being a top student.  
  
![American kid, Chinese school and HEAVY books need two bags every day](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017eea8d497f970d.jpg)  
  
BUT we are [eclectic homeschoolers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html "homeschool and travel"), [worldschoolers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html/ "world school while traveling"), [unschoolers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "unschool and travel"), freedom-loving life long learners by nature and attachment parents, so there are also things compromised when we make the choice to dip into schools for [language immersion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raising-a-bilingual-child-or-trilingual.html#more "raising a bilingual or trilingual child"). With every choice, there are always pros and cons. Time spent in [Mandarin immersion](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/mandarin-chinese-learning-at-home-and-abroad.html "Mandarin immersion"), means less time for other things.  
  
We moved recently ( photos coming) to a new [apartment in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/penang-apartment-or-condo-rental-plenty-of-choices.html "apartment in penang") ,which meant we had to go from getting up at 6am to getting up at 5am, six days of the week for her school. That alone was not fun and all of us prefer to homeschool which also allows us more free time to travel and be together. As older parents, we know how fast a childhood goes and we don't want to miss one second...one of our main purposes for [our travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "Our travel lifestyle"). Immersing in school steals some of those precious hours and we are so happy to have them back.  
  
![lovely ocean and mountain views from our new home](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901b90baff970b.jpg)  
  
  
We are grateful we started this school at ten for language advantages,  but now it is time to change, at least for a while. We will see how it goes, but so far, so good.  
  
We've got an excellent [Chinese tutor](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/tutoring-in-asia-why-asians-get-superior-test-scores.html "Chinese tutor in Asia") that comes to the house 4 times a week, thus Mozart is already far, ahead of her class in school because she can do one-on-one learning at her own pace ( since she already has extensive Mandarin  experience ...as I don't think this would work as well in the beginning stages, but is great for refinement stage).  
  
We're looking for a volunteer position where she can immerse more in conversation too ( besides her Mandarin-speaking friends here). We hope to complete at least up to 6th grade level in reading and writing in Mandarin before leaving Asia, but that shouldn't take too long.  
  
![Blond American girl in Chinese school](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901b90d16d970b.jpg)  
  
  
This leaves lots of extra time for self led play, making things, art, drama, entrepreneurship_,_ explorations, knitting,creating, sewing, hugs etc., as well as English passions like Chemistry, Algebra and Geometry ( easier in English rather than Mandarin writing so she can progress more quickly as she is quite the math whiz as is her dad who helps her), singing, piano, violin, composing, reading great Classic Literature, writing,and time for Spanish pursuits as well.  
  
She has joined a new Choir and is preparing for a performance, learning acting at the Actors Studio and preparing for a performance, as well as joining an environmental nature club and learning volleyball with a nearby international school. She is also rapidly devouring their library.  
  
![Beautiful sunrises from our bedrooms and sunsets from the kitchen in our new home= perfect!](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901b92bd1d970b.jpg)  
  
This really works well for our family, and we are gloriously happy,  but alas it gives me MUCH less time for the blog than when she was in school.  
  
Add to that my turning into a [fermenting](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-mango-papaya-chutney.html "fermenting chutney"), [kefir-making](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/-how-to-make-kefir-easy-goats-milk-or-coconut-milk.html "kefir how to make goat milk or coconut milk "), cooking, [broth-making](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/how-to-make-nourishing-bone-broth-recipes-to-heal.html "bone broth"), primal baking, veggie chopping, paleo ice-cream making, real food advocate and frugal, sustainable, homestead kind of gal now, who is spending **extraodinary** amounts of time in my new kitchen creating [delicious, healthy food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "delicious healthy food") for our rather strict [diet to cure cavities](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/curing-gum-disease-and-cavities-naturally.html "curing gum disease and cavities natually") ( details coming) means I find myself behind in all other areas including the blog.  
  
![my new kitchen](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901b9100e5970b.jpg)  
  
So the blog will have to slow down a bit while we adjust to this new schedule and I catch up. My health is almost 100% now and I am looking forward to sharing more with you about [travel health](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "travel health") as I have just gotten some blood tests that show the progress thanks to the diet changes.  
  
I've also lost about 35 pounds, although I have much, much more to lose, so I need to keep time for that goal in my schedule ( which also means less time sitting and writing to avoid bloggers butt). I try to do more online things standing now, since studies show us that [sitting is deadly](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-02/many-reasons-chair-killing-you "sitting is deadly").  
  
![Yum! Mango Clafouti and kefir makes busy kitchen](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301901b910df3970b.jpg)  
  
I am loving learning all these new things by doing, like this photo of a delicous Mango Clafouti that I baked changing Julia Child's classic recipe to paleo-healthy for us with a tropical twist ( made with mangos, [coconut milk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/-superfood-healthy-coconut-tropical-nourishing-tradition-in-asia.html "coconut milk super food"), [pastured eggs](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raw-eggs-healthy-or-not.html "pastured eggs"), organic raw honey and coconut flour. that I make from scratch!  Recipe coming!) We are trying grain free ( to avoid phytic acid) along with our [raw goat milk](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/best-fresh-raw-goats-milk-penang.html "raw goat milk") plan, so I've needed to explore new recipes and ideas.  
  
Every day I am doing things that simply amaze me like making sauerkraut, baked beet chips, delish roasted turnips, [homemade fermented mayo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/how-to-make-homemade-lacto-fermented-mayonnaise.html "diy fermented mayo"), making my own coconut flour, [fermented salsa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-healthy-lacto-fermented-salsa.html "fermented salsa"), fermented cabbage juice, kvass, [DIY deodorant](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-diy-homemade-deodorant-easy-cheap-healthy.html "diy deodorant"), DIY kitchen cleaner, [kefir cheese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/how-to-make-diy-goat-cheese-with-kefir.html "kefir cheese"), dehydrating, [DIY shampoo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-make-diy-homemade-shampoo-and-creme-rinse-easy-cheap-healthy.html "DIY shampoo"), banana bread, ice cream, primal coconut muffins,  etc etc. I love it all and want to share recipes with you..but the time steals away.  
  
We also are trying to get our books done, starting with the one about curing gum disease and moving on to many more including some on [camping Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/camping-europe-in-a-motorhome-rv-5-best-sites-roadtrip-europe-family-travel-budget-best-price.html "camping europe") and a series that Mozart wants to do for kids about every country she has been to. There are still a ton of posts about Europe, China, Hawaii, Australia, Florida, Bhutan and more I want to share as well as more trips around Asia.  
  
So hang in there while I try to figure out how to do all of this at the same time!

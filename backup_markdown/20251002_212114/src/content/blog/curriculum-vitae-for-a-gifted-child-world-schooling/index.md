Have you ever written a [Curriculum Vitae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae "CV or Curriculum Vitae")? It is a more detailed synopsis than a resume and usually used when applying for a scientific, educational, academic or research position.  I had never heard of one  before, but I guess they are popular in Europe and China, as we were asked to send one to the school that Mozart will go to in China while living with a family there. They are called CV's for short.

_(Winning Mandarin elocution speech)_  
  
It was quite enlightening for me to pull together quickly, looking at her whole education background so far and trying an attempt to explain our [unusual lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html " travel lifestyle of RTW family doing extended travel") and choices to folks who have no access to the regular internet ( thus no links) and do not speak English. This sample was translated to Mandarin by the language school we are working with and is a bit heavy on photos as they wanted that ( the educational facts are at the bottom).  
  
Curriculum Vitae roughly translated from the Latin means "the course of my life" and I found Mozart's quite interesting and telling (especially as most of it was not planned) and thought you might too:  
  
  
  
**A NOMADIC CHILD'S CURRICULUM VITAE**  
  
Mozart is a fluent trilingual  American child born in [San Francisco](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/san-francisco-travel-why-we-love-it.html "San Francisco"), California area who has been [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "traveling the world") with her parents non-stop for the last 9 years to educate her as a [global citizen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "global citizen"). We started [our world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family world trip") when she was 5 and she just turned 14, so she is likely the [most well traveled child in the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "mozart - most well traveled child in the world") with a kids record for the most global UNESCO sites visited.  
  
![6a00e5502a9507883301543530867e970c-pi](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c31f15e75970b.jpg)  
  
  
She is a happy, out going child who loves to read, sing, make art and play and has a passion for world peace, people and [sustainability/green issues](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "kid with passion for green issues winning speech"). She plays the [violin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "violin"), [piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ar90wOnWnM "piano") and loves to compose songs. She is a Dragon in Chinese astrology and so is her mom, so it's exciting to first visit China together in a Dragon year.  
  
![Beautiful child at sacred  Tigers Nest Bhutan](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c31f16ef6970b.jpg)  
  
We have been to 47 countries on 5 continents so far. We are monolingual parents, but wanted to raise her as a trilingual from birth in the world's dominant languages ( English, Spanish and Mandarin) as we feel one can not really understand a culture without knowing the language well. She wants to learn French next.  
  
![Happy around-the-world traveling family](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017744cf1617970d.jpg)  
  
  
We are older parents, thus wanted more time together as a family, so took the risk to sell all our things to  [retire early](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "retire early") to do this. We think experiences and time together are more important than things, so we live a simple life.

Mozart has been tested as an exceptionally  gifted child, so we have chosen a unique way to educate her. ( She walked and talked well at 6 months old in 2 languages, taught herself to read at 2, tested at a 3rd grade level  ( 9 years old) at 3 years old and 10th grade ( 16 years old) at 6 years and tested with top scores in math and language at Johns Hopkins University CTY gifted programs). She has done well in many John Hopkins University CTY classes online and in person. At 13 she scored higher than 97% of high school students who take the SAT.

We are interested in coming to China because we have great interest in Chinese culture and Mandarin. Mozart is the youngest, smallest and only Caucasian in her 1000 kid [Mandarin high school in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Mandarin school in Asia"), so is use to being in an all Mandarin environment.

Last year when she was celebrating Chinese New Year with her 83 year old Grandmother in [Georgetown, Malaysia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "georgetown Malaysia photos"), they ended up being interviewed  on Chinese television dressed in their Cheongsam traditional dresses.

**September 2005 to June 2006**  
  
Early entrance to a 1st/2nd grade top  public school in California at 4 ( where all her classmates were 7,8 and 9) based on her abilities and the school had never done this before. Still problematic because her reading levels were far ahead of class mates, but her writing skills were a challenge due to age related finger dexterity. Thus, we decided to "world school".  
  
**September 2004 to June 2005**  
  
Started Kindegarten at 3 ( usual age in USA is 6 as were most of her classmates, but they made an exception due to her abilities)

Started violin at 23 months old and piano at 3 and we've continued both as we travel the world as we can , often by webcam with teachers on other continents.

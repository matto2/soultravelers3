“There is no better way to be part of Sevilla’s life than thru the tapas experience. Tapas bring all social classes together and while in other parts of Spain tapas are a pleasant diversion, here they are an integral part of daily activity.”

Says best selling Spanish cookbook author Penelope Casas in her book Discovering Spain. I have read similar thoughts in several guides which say to forget about restaurants for the most part in Seville and live on tapas.

We are not late night types, but we did check out the tapa scene at a recommended place near where we saw the Flamenco on our second night. We were hungry after the show and looking for a nibble and as my friend from Malaga says, “Tapas are just little snacks”.

We are used to those Iberian hams hanging by their hooves now, but have become quite fond of this typical spanish custom. We don’t eat pork (kind of a sad thing in Spain where it is the specialty) but are amused and delighted by the odd decoration. It is not a sight one sees in America, especially with the little hooves.

The tuna is also very good in Spain as is the olive oil. Mozart fell in love with a tuna that was in a red sauce and decided it was the best thing she ever ate in her life and proceeded to have two dishes just for herself. She loved the little forks too which was just her size.

We have actually enjoyed just about all the tapas we have tried in Spain and Seville’s were no exception.  
It was fun to be a part of the vibrant night scene and good  excuse to have another Sangria and San Miguel beer. We had happy bellies as we meandered thru the maze of the old town back to our hotel and comfy bed.

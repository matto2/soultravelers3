We are big fans of hotel alternatives, so when the New York Times said "Stay tuned for the hip [Roomorama.com](http://www.roomorama.com/)", in [this article](http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/magazine/15wwln-medium-t.html?scp=1&sq=Roomorama&st=nyt), we thought it was a great idea to check them out for ourselves and our readers.

They were our sponsors for our trip to London and provided a smashing two bedroom, three bathroom luxury apartment in a beautiful neighborhood that is directly across the street from [The Natural History Museum.](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/index.html) [Mozart](http://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3) was literally jumping for joy when she saw it and it is perfect for a family stay with every convenience and very centrally located near [Hyde Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London).

Whether you are looking for a place to stay while traveling or if you have a spare room and looking for an easy way to earn some cash, Roomorama is a quality service that you can trust. I was very impressed with the 24/7 customer service and attention to detail that they provide.

We gave them very late notice for a weeks stay in central London and it just so happened that they had only recently opened in London and Jia, one of the owners, was traveling on business. But despite these challenges (plus my temporary handicap state due to [my recent hospitalization in Austria](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html)), Jia did a terrific job of communicating and solving the various complications that came up.

Jia wanted us to use the service like a customer would so we could get first hand experience on how easy it was to do online. It truly was a piece of cake even for a non-geek like me! I do suggest that you do not cut it so close (as we did)  in a city like London that books up quickly in the central areas.

We liked quite a few apartments by Ewa and finally narrowed it down to one of hers. I needed a stand up shower as my wounded arm prevents me from getting into a bath tub, so she and Jia went out of their way to find me a suitable place, including one with an elevator.

We all really loved the place they found for us and we are really comfortable here. It has a huge flat screen TV, high end furnishings, top of the line dishwasher, washing machine, a lovely terrace, great privacy, well secured and ideal location. Who could ask for anything more? Thanks so much Roomorama for being a great sponsor for us in London!

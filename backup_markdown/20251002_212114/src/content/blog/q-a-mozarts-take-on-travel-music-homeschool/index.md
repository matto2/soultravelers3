[14 year old Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/10/mozart-sings-at-the-house-of-blues.html "Beautiful teen singer Mozart sings at house of blues") had many requests to do a Q&A about her [singing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/06/wings-mozart-rocks-little-mix-and-lookssings-like-a-pop-star.html "Mosart singer pop star teen"), [music](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/09/teen-mozart-sings-youtube-adele-cover-more.html "travel teen Mozart sings adele"), [travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "The most well-traveled child in the world - Mozart"), [unschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/home-school-science-unschool-and-world-school-tips.html "unschooling and science and travel") and more, so if you have ever wondered about these things, you will enjoy her latest [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/soultravelers3 "soultravelers3 on youtube") [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlHKQ0-s0yg&list=UUcMwuQFsEJfOct29ZTa0v8w "Q & A with Mozart").  
  
She got so many great questions from her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MozartST3 "Mozart on twitter") and [Music by Mozart](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Music-by-Mozart/1467999363475343?ref=br_tf "Music by Mozart") [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Music-by-Mozart/1467999363475343?ref=br_tf "Music by Mozart on Facebook"), that she is going to break it down to two videos and this one is the first:

**MOZART'S SINGING TRANSFORMS OUR LIVES**  
  
Mozart's singing transformed our lives in 2014, so when I look at our year in review, even in travel terms, Mozart's talents led our adventures. She turned 13 and we were propelled into a new universe!

**MOZART'S SONG "YOU'RE NOT ALONE ON ITUNES**  
  
2015 looks even more exciting and her [beautiful song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUd-6FmGFVU&list=UUcMwuQFsEJfOct29ZTa0v8w "You're Not Alone is a beautiful new song by Mozart"), ["You're Not Alone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbw0TStvJng "You're Not Alone by Mozart") , that she wrote about Human Trafficking,  goes up on itunes this week! A first!! [Dallas Lovato](http://demi-lovato.wikia.com/wiki/Dallas_Lovato "Dallas Lovato") is also taking it to movie producers she is working with and thinks it will be used in a movie soundtrack!

**OUR TRAVEL REVOLVES AROUND MOZART**  
  
Our travels have always revolved around trilingual Mozart's needs, although we never expected to go in this direction. In 20/20 hindsight, I suppose I should have [seen it coming](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html "Mozart singing as a baby"), but I was utterly shocked when we were living in a [small town in Malaysia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "typical Malaysia") & some of the top [TV](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/06/how-to-get-on-tv.html "How to get on TV") & Film producers in the world ( based in LA) found her and were interested in her starring in TV shows!

**MOZART'S SINGING IS A CALLING AND DESTINY**  
  
Due to my [health issues](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "traveling with health challenges") ( which are much better now & I will be writing about that) and all the attention on Mozart, plus a signed contract for a TV show, we quickly decided to leave Asia last December ( 2013) and get some training for Mozart for singing and acting as it has become very clear that this is her calling and destiny. Two of her fellow singing students just got golden tickets for American Idol & another that she shot a music video with was on The Voice.

**HOMESCHOOLING/UNSCHOOLING MOZART**  
  
As a [homeschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling and travel")/[unschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "unschool or homeschool gifted child ")/ [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school travel education") family, we are all about supporting her choices and following her lead and right now her biggest passions are [singing, songwriting](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/06/mozart-sings-everything-we-are-original-song-supporting-environment.html "Mozart is a teen singer and songwriter"), [music](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/mozart-plays-mozart-and-more-violin-and-piano-performance.html "travel teen Mozart playing violin and piano performance"), dancing, [public speaking,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "public speaking") and acting.

**TV PROJECTS IN THE WORKS FOR MOZART**  
  
That first TV contract didn't reach fruition, but we've since been approached by several other TV projects by top producers, so time will tell where this all will lead. I haven't even had a chance to get an agent yet, as most of this year has felt like we jumped on a very fast moving train and are still trying to get our bearings in this new world.

**MOZART - A TEEN WANTING TO CHANGE THE WORLD**  
  
Raising a teen who wants to [change the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/change-the-world-cambiar-el-mundo-%E6%94%B9%E5%8F%98%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-adorable-video-by-trilingual-mozart-.html "Change the world Cambiar el Mundo! 改变世界!

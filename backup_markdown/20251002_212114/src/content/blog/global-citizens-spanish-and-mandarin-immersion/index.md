Mandarin Chinese and Spanish are two of this planet's most important and widely spoken languages and according to the 2000 U.S. Census, Chinese is the third most common spoken language in the United States after English and Spanish. The ability to read, write and speak the dominant languages of our planet, opens many doors and is an essential part in being a true [global citizen](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/how-to-and-why-raise-a-global-kid.html "global citizen").  
  
You can't really understand a culture without knowing the language and spending time fully immersed in it amongst that culture is the easiest and best way to learn. I've written extensively about this in my 3 part series, [How to Raise a Bilingual or Multilingual Child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/how-to-raise-a-bilingual-or-multi-lingual-child.html "how to raise a bilingual or multilingual child") that is filled with tips that have worked for us.  
  
Sadly, the United States ( and most English speaking countries) lags in high school and college graduates who can read, write and speak Mandarin and Spanish fluently. The [importance of Mandarin in business](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-30/mandarin-chinese-most-useful-business-language-after-english-1-.html "the importance of Mandarin in business") in all of Asia is obvious to us as is Spanish in all the countries where it is dominant. Our world is shrinking.  
  
I am not saying that one must speak only in [Mandarin Chinese](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/mandarin-chinese-learning-at-home-and-abroad.html "mandarin chinese learning") ,[Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/last-day-of-sch.html "American kid learning spanish in spain") and English or other dominant languages to be a world citizen or that one must be fluent as a native, as learning any other language at any level is better than nothing and a step in the right direction. My daughter speaks bits of many languages and all of it is valuable in my eyes.  
  
We are monolinguals raising a fluent-as-a-native trilingual/triliterate, so know the challenges first hand. One of the challenges is keeping up with all three languages as kids can lose languages as quickly as they pick them up.

Like [learning a musical instrument](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/kid-playing-violin-around-the-world.html "learning a musical instrument "), one needs daily practice reading, writing and speaking all three languages if you want to be fluent as a native. Without the practice, even adults can get rusty and even lose much of their native tongue.  
  
There are hardly any [Spanish speakers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/spanish-dancer.html "Spanish speakers") in Asia, so that adds to our challenges here. Luckily, we happened to have a neighbor last year who was from Mexico and they have two daughters Mozart's age, so that relationship helps greatly. As well as her long distance relationships with [Spanish speaking friends in Spain.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "spanish speaking friends in spain")  
  
But our [11 year old is in Mandarin school here in Asia,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/chinese-school-trophy-girl-.html "11 year old American in Mandarin school in Asia") six days a week, so there is less time for that, especially now that we live in a different condo. Last year they could play almost every day after school in the pool and playground. This years playground and pool group has no Spanish speakers.

Mozart has a mysterious and magical way of manifesting what she wants and needs and she has been wanting [a Spanish speaker](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html "spanish speaker") in her Mandarin school. She has Korean, Thai, Japanese and Indonesian friends who have their own "private" languages to share, so she wanted to do that with another fluent Spanish speaker.  
  
Recently a 15 year old boy from Chile ( who speaks no English or Mandarin) came to the school, but is in another class ( with mostly Thai kids who also don't speak English or Mandarin so learning both in the foundation class here).  
  
That was a happy day for her, but even better, she now sits next to a Korean girl who just moved here from China. Luckily she spent a year in Madrid, so [speaks Spanish](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "learning spanish in spain"). Her English is very weak, so they only communicate in Spanish ( and fill in with Mandarin when needed).  
  
What are your tricks and tips for learning languages and keeping them up over the many years of childhood? How important do you think being multilingual is for being a world citizen and understanding different cultures?

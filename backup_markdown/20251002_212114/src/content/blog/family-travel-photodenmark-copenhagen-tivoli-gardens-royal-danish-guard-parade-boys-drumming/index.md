Family travel in Copenhagen, Denmark means not missing world famous Tivoli Gardens, the oldest [amusement park](http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/tourist/what_to_see_and_do/events/event_calendar/venue_info?VenueID=6) in [the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoli_Gardens) and [inspiration](http://www.tivoli.dk/composite-3351.htm) for [Disneyland](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/home/home?name=HomePage&bhcp=1)! We barely made it, but luck was with us as we manage to see it on the very last day of the season.

 Mozart had been anticipating this moment ever since we visited the Grona Lunds Tivoli in Stockholm and we told her it was coming up. Scandinavia was full of fun attractions for kids, including the [original Legoland](http://www.legoland.dk/?lc=en) and [Junibacken](http://www.junibacken.se/default.asp?id=1234) (a museum dedicated to Pippi Longstocking).

The good news about visiting it on the last day is that there were extra parades and celebrations based on closing day ceremonies. What an enchanting surprise to see a kid sized royal carriage and boys dressed in red uniforms almost identical to the Danish Guard, come marching by as we played!

The Tivoli Boys Guard was founded in 1844 and consists of a hundred boys between the ages of 9 and 16. It seemed most were around nine and they looked so cute in their bright red military coats, white pants and furry bear skin hats! We were pleased that we ran into them several times during the long day and night that we were there.

I will be writing more about our exciting time in Scandinavia that we just adored. We have so many pictures too that we haven't had time to get up yet, but we will soon, hopefully. Balancing daily family life, travel, homeschool, our [Reach The World](http://www.reachtheworld.org/journey/journeytoeurope) volunteer weekly work and documenting on the move is always a challenge, but eventually we'll get it all up.

For some reason, I just love this picture that captures the moment, even the hands in motion as they drummed.I can almost hear the music and it instantly brings back the warm memories of that joyous day and delightful surprise. I hope you can "hear" it too!

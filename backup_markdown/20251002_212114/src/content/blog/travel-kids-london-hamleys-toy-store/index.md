If you are going to London as a family with kids, don't miss the iconic [Hamleys Toy Shop](http://www.hamleys.com/ "hamleys") on Regent Street as it has been a London landmark and opened since 1881. There are seven floors of fun which will please any child or child at heart.  
  
Hamleys is located a few blocks south of Oxford Circus tube station in an area rich with history and architecture, so something for more sophisticated tastes as well. Here our Mozart is having a ball playing with a gigantic scary thing.

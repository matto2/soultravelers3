It was a beautiful, tropical Christmas Day in Asia and we enjoyed an unplugged day of simple pleasures. It's already Boxing Day here, or the day after Christmas, yet we just had lovely conversations with family at home who were still doing Christmas Day.

This is primarily a photo post to share some of our first Christmas in Penang with you and family. That's Mozart hanging out on one of our couches with her Hello Kitty chocolate advent calendar wearing her new night gown which was the present she opened on Christmas Eve. We unplugged on Christmas to be totally focused on the simple pleasures.

The kid made out like a bandit as usual! The prices here are divine and some of the things were things she needs for here, plus a few toys that we will store for our several winters here.

The Christmas morning unwrapping fenzy! One real book, the rest on her kindle.

Lazing at the pool is part of Christmas here.

Most wanted gift? Her very own pink phone for our tween that we promised her if she had to go by bus to her Chinese school. Luckily the van will take her from door to door, but good to have just in case.

Happy kid on best family day of the year!

View out my bedroom window on Christmas. Soothing to the soul.

Another coveted present, a scooter which is perfect for here & very cheap ( she has another one at home in California, but the very large resort pool & playground area is perfect for one here.

![piano keyhoard gift](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e1056c0c970b.jpg)  
  
Her good digital piano is in our motorhome in Europe, so we bought a cheap keyboard to keep here.

![christmas cookies](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e1056d94970b.jpg)  
  
They don't look great, but our home made chocolate cookies were scrumptious. No ovens in Asia, so we improvised and used our toaster oven. Mozart loooves to bake, so if there is a will, there is way. Even if that means two cookies at a time in the oven with no temperature on it. Good memories forever.

What kid doesn't like opening presents?

![christmas tree with world ornaments](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e10572fe970b.jpg)  
  
We have collected ornaments from around the world which makes it fun to reminisce.

Surprise and joy!

![tropical pool fun penang](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e10576d4970b.jpg)  
  
Pool time even on Christmas. Mozart likes her daily fix and prefers swimming there rather than the nearby beach across the road. Even with maximum numbers this week, it's still not crowded.

![IMG_4692](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330148c70ee4a9970c.jpg)  
  
Mixing her love of baking, creating, clay and imaginative play, Mozart wanted this ice cream maker from playdough & made lots of money, numbers, etc to set up her shop.

![IMG_4696](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330148c70ee86a970c.jpg)  
  
Her fantasy was to serve us delights all day, so we had endless treats & did a mock up TV interview of her very famous treat shop.

![IMG_4668](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a950788330147e1058044970b.jpg)  
  
A new wallet/coin purse in her stocking ( along with her fave vinegar pringles, card games and few other things) so she has a place for her lunch money for school as she is looking forward to the cafeteria! We had a lovely traditional dinner, but I didn't take any pictures. We ended the day with a movie DVD and half and today saw the funny Gulliver  movie at the local theater.

All and all, a perfect Christmas Day! Hope yours was too. What was your favorite moment?

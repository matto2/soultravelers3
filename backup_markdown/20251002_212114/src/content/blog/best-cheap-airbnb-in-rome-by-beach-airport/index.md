Did you know that you can stay at the nearby [beach with a sea view](https://www.timeout.com/rome/things-to-do/best-beaches-in-rome) while [visiting Rome](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/05/rome-in-spring-top-tips-for-a-perfect-day.html#more)? We've even taken the fun  [Barcelona-Rome Cruise Ferry](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-rome.html) a few times with our [vintage van](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/06/tiny-house-on-wheels-vintage-rv-remodel-.html)! We [love Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-italy-verona-farm-stay-agritourismo-romeo-juliet-arena-opera.html) & have done a lot of [travel around Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/italy-with-kids-travel-tips.html) over the years,( including [me living there](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/how-my-almost-teen-became-a-model-.html)) but we didn’t know that [great beach](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/italian-memoria.html) was there in [Rome!](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/roma.html) It is part of the Metropolitan City of Rome & a coastal suburb near the airport in Fiumicino. We prefer [long “van life” visits](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/01/americans-van-life-in-europe-2022.html), but this time we chose [this airbnb short stay](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/783309690923540302?source_impression_id=p3_1687364405_fl2ahVshw5olbMML) (between our [digital nomad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/09/vacation-vs-full-time-travel-digital-nomad-lifestyle.html) "[Schengen shuffle"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/05/what-is-schengen-shuffle-travel-how-to-do-it.html#more) winter [beach stay in Larnaca](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/02/larnaca-travel-tips-.html) &  our [vintage van](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/07/camping-spain-simple-pleasures.html#more) [camping resort](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/05/cheap-furnished-rentals-in-barcelona-beach-resort.html) near [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/04/21-of-the-best-things-to-do-in-barcelona-in-2022.html) ) where we are [house hunting](http://soultravelers3new.local/2022/07/americans-house-hunting-in-spain-home-buying-abroad-.html) & our 22 year old daughter  [Heavenly is visiting us](http://soultravelers3new.local/2023/05/heavenly-reyna-lands-next-movie-hits-twitchcon-paris.html#more) at this summer solstice celebration.

If you want to get the most out of our short stay getaway at the best price, this Rome airbnb apartment on the beach near the airport is a great choice! You can have the best of both worlds.

 Large cities can be hectic with crowds, tourists & traffic, so we tend to like to stay in more relaxed areas (cheaper too)  & go into the city ( like Rome) for the day as day trips and the mass transit or taxis from here make that easy. One can also rotate doing an intense city touring day and then a relaxing beach day.

This was not a perfect place, but worked perfectly for us. It was large and bright with lots of light shining in.

The first morning we enjoyed the beautiful sunrise from the very large terrace.

The kitchen was more than adequate for our needs and most if you want to cook most or all your meals.

 The wrap around terrace was huge and on the top floor so lovely views of the sea, but one down side was it is a 5 floor walk up and we did not know that until we arrived!

 Never the less we thought it was great and we enjoyed Rome and the beach and we arrived late at night because the budget airline changed our flight and the co host picked us up after 1am which made the late arrival better and worth the extra charge.   
  
![Best Cheap Airbnb in Rome by Beach & Airport  beauty peace ](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883302c1b2573cbe200d-2048x1607-1.jpg)  
We paid less than one hundred dollars per night and really enjoyed our stay, so can recommend this place and area!

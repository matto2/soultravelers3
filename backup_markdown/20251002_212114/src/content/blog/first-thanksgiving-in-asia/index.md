"Wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving" Kahil Gibran   

In this season of gratitude, we have many things to be grateful for like this gorgeous view out our windows from our new winter home in [Penang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penang "penang"), [Malaysia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia "malaysia"). We remember our [first Thanksgiving in Spain in 2006](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/happy-thanksgiv.html "thanksgiving in spain") when we began our [world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "family world tour") and the many [wonderful Thanksgiving meals](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/thanksgiving-blessings-in-spain-.html "wonderful thanksgiving meals") that we have had at home with family. This year we will have a tropical Thanksgiving and that in itself feels a bit surreal as we settle in and adjust to a new way of being.

It has been intense travel the last two months from [Malaga](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-tips-in-spains-costa-del-sol-countryside-adventures-mediterranean-beaches-photography-.html "Malaga Costa del sol") to London, NYC, San Francisco, [Santa Cruz](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-santa-cruz-california-beautiful-beach-house-homeaway-luxury-rental-home.html "santa cruz"), Fresno, Honolulu, [Kauai,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-kauai-hawaii-photo-luau-hawaiin-culture-napali-coast-sail-best-for-kids.html "Kauai") Tahiti, [Bora Bora](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/bora-bora-on-a-cheap-budget-travel-tahiti-moorea-and-french-polynesia.html "Bora bora"), [Moorea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-french-polynesia-cheaply.html "Moorea french polynesia"), New Zealand, Sydney, Singapore to Penang, so we are more than ready for a rest. We also had two close relatives rushed to the hospital via 911 when we were visiting home and two deaths of close, very precious loved ones while on the road this year, one in Spain and one in Bora Bora, so that has taken a huge toll.Two very special and beloved dads/Grandpas.

Thus, it will be a quiet, simple and sweet Thanksgiving in this new country, mostly spent with relatives at a distance in California via webcam calls. Then, when they head to bed early in our day, we will head to the pool here at our resort and to the movie theater in the mall to see the new Harry Potter movie. We haven't seen English movies in a theater together in 5 years, Mozart is a Harry Potter fanatic who has read the books so much they are almost memorized, has a day off from her new [Mandarin classes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel/comments/page/2/ "mandarin classes") coincidentally, and movies are extremely cheap here in the HUGE mall nearby, much bigger than the one at home.It seemed like a logical choice and treat for us.

Life goes on during this tender time and we get through it step by step. We are soothed by this new environment, but  having only been here for five days so far, we are  still learning the ropes and finding a routine. It is good to be not living out of a suitcase for a while, but grief finds you, no matter where you are or what day or holiday it is. Despite having a ton of work to do to catch up, I find myself resistant to doing anything, but make myself plug along. I know death, loss and grief are part of life, but I don't have to like it. I never seem to be prepared for it, the continual blow that it is to the stomach or how long it takes to recover from the black cloud blues that engulfs me. My heart aches the most knowing my dearest ones are in emotional pain and there is little I can do.

We are ever so grateful for all the time we DID have with our tender hearted, sweet beloveds, so we will keep our focus on that this holiday season. After the holidays, my almost 83 year old mother will join us for a while, so we will be Soultravelers4 for a bit. We wish all of our American readers a very sweet Thanksgiving and the focus on gratitude to everyone!

"The Pilgrims made seven times more graves than huts. No Americans have been more impoverished than these who, nevertheless, set aside a day of thanksgiving." Westermayer

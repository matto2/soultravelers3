Is your school out for summer? The schools in Spain let out for summer on June 23 and it was a big holiday in [Barcelona for Midsummer called St Joan's Day](http://pocketcultures.com/topicsoftheworld/2010/06/22/magical-midsummer-night/). Mozart has been having an idyllic summer at our favorite [Barcelona Beach Resort.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html), but our 9 year old finished school in our little village in  Spain at the end of  May as we started our fourth [European summer road trip.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html)  Foreign local schools are a fantastic way to become multi-literate and multi-lingual and deeply immerse in a culture.

School is out forever for her in Spain, but it's really been an amazing experience. She was just six when she started her [first day of school in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/first-day-of-sc.html). We're monolinguals who have worked hard to raise her as a very [fluent trilingual /triliterate from birth](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html), but her Spanish was becoming more receptive because she was living in an English dominated society in California. Now she is as fluent as a native speaker.

We are [eclectic unschoolers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html) and mostly do [child led learning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html), but decided to put her into a local school in Spain for [five months for several years to immerse deeply in the language, literature and culture](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/around-the-world-family-travel-soultravelers3-digital-nomad-global-international-family-travel.html). It was also a way to give he[r consistent friends and a base as we travel the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html). There was also one German boy, one Moroccan boy, one Netherlands girl and one English boy...and our little American girl. She had this same teacher for several years and we all liked him. She had a very sweet woman teacher for first grade and okay one for second and this man who we all liked.

We weren't sure how it would all work out when [we left California  in 2006](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/08/home-and-hous-1.html), but now we are so glad that we did this. Most of the kids are local whose families have lived in this small village for centuries. In this class there are six sets of cousins!

On her last day of school, they all gave her sweet good bye letters and pictures and she played her violin for them. I think she was a bit stunned by all the attention and got much applause and even calls for an encore, which she did. She has [played her piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ar90wOnWnM) a few times in music class, but they haven't heard her on violin since first grade. Her music teacher came in to watch too. We had a little party and the kids danced, ate junk food  and played the Spanish version of rock, paper, scissors that is really cute with a rhyme, ritual  and cheek holding.  ( We'll do a video soon). Good bye school in Spain, thanks for having us!

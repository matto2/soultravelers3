What is the best education in the world? We think the very best 21st century education is global learning, using the world as your classroom and that education is everywhere. There are no limits to worldschooling.  
  
No, you don't need to be as [rich as Suri Cruise](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/do-you-have-to-be-rich-like-suri-cruise-to-world-school-learn-mandarin-.html "rich as suri cruise worldschool") to take advantage of [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/curriculum-vitae-for-a-gifted-child-world-schooling.html "world schooling"). Truly, almost anyone can do it and we've proved it these last 7 plus years, by [traveling the world with a school age child](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/best-friends-around-the-world-traveling-with-school-age-kids.html "traveling the world with school age child") to 45 countries on 5 continents so far and living large on $23/day per person.  
  
Our daughter was five when we began our [world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "famly world tour") and now is 12, a [fluent trilingual/triliterate](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/raising-a-bilingual-child-or-trilingual.html "raising a fluent bilingual or trilingual kid") in Chinese, Spanish and English and far [ahead of age peers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/curriculum-vitae-for-a-gifted-child-world-schooling.html "ahead of age peers - gifted") in school while having more time with her parents than most kids ever get. It's been more successful than we ever imagined and our best decision ever.  
  
Our primary reason for traveling is to educate our child, so we've written a lot about it to share the keys we have learned along the way.  
  
In this photo, our daughter is doing homeschool work in [Moorea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/moorea-cheap-and-amazing.html "moorea travel tahiti") in [French Polynesia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/family-travel-french-polynesia-cheaply.html "french polynesia") where we couchsurfed with locals for free in this gorgeous home with a view. She could work on math,French and Chinese when we were hanging out, science when we played with a dolphin, [fed turtle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/bora-bora-heaven-on-a-cheap-budget.html "feeding turtles tahiti")s  or she swam with sharks, then local culture as we learned traditional dance and so forth.  
  
Each place helps us learn more about our world!

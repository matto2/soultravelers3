Family Travel: The Farther You Go the Closer You Get  
I love this title because it is so trueÂ  and this series, although I was a little disappointed in this book because it was more about stories when I was looking for specific, practical information. Still, the stories are great as usual and can be inspiring as you plan your own travel.

Traveler's Guide to European Camping  
We find this the best book for camping in Europe.  
We use many of this type, but this one is the most  
clear and easiest to read. They have good campsites  
and give a lot more information than most books.  
They also have GPS coordinates for all camping sites.  
Don't leave home without it!

Happy 4th of July weekend and Independence Day to all my American readers! We are having such a wonderful time in [Barcelona at the beach](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html), that we are having a hard time leaving, but we will soon head into [France](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/soultravelers3/france/index.html), starting with some explorations in our beloved [Provence](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/10/good-morning-pr.html).

It is #FollowFriday on Twitter and you may have noticed that last week I suggested [traveling lifestyle design folks](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/location-independent-lifestyle-design-global-nomad-ff-workshifting-4hww-extended-travel-freedom-love.html) and [travel writers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/travel-blogger-love-followfriday-on-twitter-social-media-best-in-travel.html) and [travel bloggers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/travel-blogger-love-followfriday-on-twitter-social-media-best-in-travel.html) the week before. I'm finding it challenging to do such a big list, so this week I'm going to just name 5 cool travel writers who are wonderful to follow on Twitter ( in no particular order) :

1) @[Benjilanyado](http://twitter.com/benjilanyado) \- I met this talented writer from the [UKGuardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/benjilanyado) and [New York Times](http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/travel/06explorer.html)  in February 2009 when I wrote about him in my [Twitter & Travel 2.0](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/02/twitter-travel-20.html) post because of his [Twitrip.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/feb/02/paris-twitter-trip-twitrip) He was also kind enough to ask us to participate in this [travel guru's guide  in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/jan/03/travel-gurus-2010-guide) ( via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/soultravelers3) of course!). He  has his own site too, [Benji's Blog](http://benjilanyado.wordpress.com/) and he is very hip, creative and knowledgeable no matter where you find him. 

2) [@ben\_coop](http://twitter.com/ben_coop) - Another hip young travel writer from the United Kingdom, I first met Ben on Stumbleupon I think. A kind, generous, witty Andalusian lover, who could ask for more? He is also the editor at [Travel Intelligence](http://www.travelintelligence.com/).

3) [carmenlroberts](http://twitter.com/carmenlroberts) - I first mentioned Carmen when we she aired one of our [Soultravelers3 Youtube videos on the BBC](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/bbc-world-news-featured-soultravelers3-youtube-viral-travel-video-fast-track-bbcnews.html) via her [Fast Track Travel Program](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/8710381.stm). Her tweets are as sassy and intelligent as her show.

4) [worldmattworld](http://twitter.com/worldmattworld) \- I was sorry to see [Matt Gross](http://worldmatt.org/) leave from the [Frugal Traveler](http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/qa-with-jeanne-dee-the-nomadic-family-traveler/), yet proud that [Soultravelers3 was interviewed in the NYT's](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/02/new-york-times-qa-with-soultravelers3-on-frugal-traveler-nomadic-family-traveler-jeanne-dee.html?cid=6a00e5502a950788330128776cdc93970c) by him. I loved his point of view and that he also included frugal family travel tips. You can still find him in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/), [Saveur](http://www.saveur.com/) , [Afar](http://www.afar.com/) and [Dadwagon](http://www.dadwagon.com/), not to mention cool books and videos coming.

5) [Vickybaker](http://twitter.com/vickybaker) - Is another savvy  Brit travel writer, but she is based in Buenos Aires these days, although in Miami now on her way to Montreal for the summer  since it's winter in Argentina.  Don't miss her tweets and her blog called [Going Local Travel.](http://www.goinglocaltravel.com/)

Celebrating Easter while [traveling as a family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling as a family") is now our normal way of life and we had a good one here in tropical Asia as we prepare for next week's take off to Singapore, Bangkok, Bhutan, and Jordan on our way back to [Europe for the summer](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "Europe for the summer road trip"). We arrived in Asia around [Thanksgiving](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/11/first-thanksgiving-in-asia.html "Thanksgiving abroad"), had a great [Christmas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/first-christmas-in-asia.html "christmas abroad") and now it's time to hit the road again. I wrote about [celebrating Christmas abroad](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "celebrating Christmas abroad") a while ago, but Easter abroad is basically the same message.  
  
One of our 10 year old daughter's highlights was getting an Easter card and gift via Fedex from her Aunt back at home. She always picks gifts that Mozart loves and this cute hat was no exception. We were told that sending things here was not a good idea as they often get stuck in customs with high fees to get out, but we seemed to have lucked out with this one.  
  
I must admit I miss our [Easters in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/spain-stunning-semana-santa-easter-procession-in-andalusia-white-village.html "easter in spain") as their "[Semana Santa](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/03/semana-santa-in.html "semana santa")" is perhaps the best place to celebrate Easter, but soon we will be back to our [old village](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/we-are-living-i.html "old village spain") and many dear friends. We are in a Muslim country this year where many others are Budhists and Hindu's etc., so no big Easter celebrations here. Mozart is sad to leave her friends here but can't wait to suprise her [old friends back in Europe.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "friends and travel")  
  
We skipped the Easter Bunny routine, now that we have a tween and she was thrilled to get to order two books on her Kindle instead and go to see the latest Justin Beiber movie, _Never Say Never_. She can't stop singing the songs and reminds me of a mini female Justin Beiber. That is the hip singer I know, so we were as surprised as anyone by her recent [angelic acapella  solo](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "beautiful angelic solo") with her Mandarin high school choir.  
  
She had a great time yesterday doing a playdate with  a friend from school and after the movie today it was down to the pool here with her Spanish speaking friend from Mexico. We caught this photo at the playground and wanted to get it up for auntie, so she could see how she was enjoying her gift! We mostly just enjoyed the simple pleasure of being together and felt filled with gratitude.  
  
Have a wonderful Easter all! What were your favorite moments?

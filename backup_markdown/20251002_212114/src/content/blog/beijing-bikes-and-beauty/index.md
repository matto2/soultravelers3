Bikes, temples and beauty remain a big part of [Beijing today](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/forbidden-city-and-beijings-best.html "best of Beijing travel"), despite the traffic, new buildings and fast pace of this city. Electric bikes are also VERY popular and the mass transit is excellent, super modern and fairly easy even for a foriegner ( although [having Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/mandarin-immersion-in-china.html "mandarin immersion in China") helps a LOT).  
  
This photo makes me smile as these kind of moments remind me of the old [Beijing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/yum-loving-the-food-in-beijing.html "beijing travel") and I am glad we still get glimpses of that, although the modern aspects are also exciting. I must get a photo of the little tin tricycles that are motorized and used as kind of taxi's for one person, as we have never seen them any where else.  
  
Off for more exploring, so mostly just short posts while we [explore China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/11/china-travel-in-the-autumn.html "China travel") and I will get into more details later.

When it comes to family travel, there is nothing kids like better than fun activities and gruesome sights and Evora had both to [entertain](http://kid-friendly-travel-destinations.suite101.com/article.cfm/culture_and_kids_in_portugal) Mozart. My guess is that the book fair was just a temporary exhibit, but it was hard to tell. It was in the main square and mostly locals were there.

We had stumbled upon a month old, new cafe where there was free wifi and the most yummy dessert. DaVinci spotted someone on a laptop as we walked by, they said it was free, so we quickly plugged in to take advantage of this opportunity. After Mozart gobbled down her dessert she was ready to keep exploring, so she and her dad  found the nearby book fair while I handled some internet business.

Books always attract Mozart and one stall was open with a little creative play area in one section and a computer with kids software in another part. Creativity has no language barrier, and Mozart quickly jumped into the foray with the local kids, glad to be gluing and cutting and making! Later she came with me and made some more and played for awhile on the computer that was just her size. One of the greatest things about extended family travel is doing ordinary things in extraordinary places!

There are lots of bone churches in Europe and we went to one in Hallstatt, so this was our second bone [chapel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/10/salt-mine-iron.html). The one in  Hallstatt was in use until the 1960's when the Catholic church started to allow cremation, as there was no safe burial ground left there. [This one](http://www.sacred-destinations.com/portugal/evora-capela-dos-ossos-bones-chapel.htm) was a little different as it was built as a reminder by three Franciscan monks about the transience of material things and says, "We bones in here wait for yours to join us" above the chapel! Indeed, it was a bit gross and intimidating to have 5000 skulls staring at you from the walls and arches.

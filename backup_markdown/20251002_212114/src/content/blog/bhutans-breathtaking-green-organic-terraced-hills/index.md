To visit this magical kingdom of Bhutan, tucked into the Himalayan mountains between China and India takes ones breath away at every turn and gives us a glimpse of an isolated land, untouched in many ways by the 21st century.  
  
Most of the land is very mountainous and green, where more than 70% of it is covered in old growth, pristine forests protected by the government. The unique animals, plants and birds, surviving here for centuries untouched, are all protected.  
  
There is only one road in all of Bhutan and it is still being built in the more rural, mountainous areas of the country. Driving on this road can often be a thrill in itself, but the views are spell binding.  
  
Organic food and farming is highly encouraged every where in Bhutan and organic food is sold at the same price as conventional food. The Ministry of Agriculture has an ambitious and unique-in-this-world goal, to make the whole country organic by 2020. 
  
I can't even tell you how beautiful this organic farm and terraced hills looked in person. Just one more tiny moment that made us fall in love with Bhutan.

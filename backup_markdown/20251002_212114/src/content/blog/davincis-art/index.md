Looking at Mozart’s work and then seeing DaVinci’s art, I think you can see why I find some similarities. I find it interesting that they choose similar palettes of color. These painting were in our home and even as a tiny baby, Mozart was drawn to them. Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but it is interesting. Is in the genes, environment, subconscious or none of these?

I don’t have access to much of DaVinci’s  art and what I do have is a copy of a copy of a copy so the quality is not accurate compared to the art in person. The lead photo at the top with the two figures in the center is one called “Streamers” and on my screen it looks the closest in color. It is one of my favorites.

I found a picture of DaVinci at one of his shows and also two of the photos that started this particular phase of his art which interestingly were taken on his first trip to Spain. I also found his “artist statement” that certainly better explains his view point on his art and process better than I ever could:

“I attempt through my art to open the door to the heart, allowing the viewer to perceive the mystical ties that bind us together as human beings. I believe all good work comes from grace and can’t be forced, so I work from my unconscious mind allowing the art to emerge as I progress. Every picture is a series of ordered relations executed in a highly intuitive and spontaneous manner.

The vibrant color and fluidity and variation of the linear treatment combine in a way that allows me to express an explosive visceral, acoustical and visual energy.  My use of the picture plane provides a necessary stillness that adds significance to the rhythmic movement. The emotional notes that I experience most in the work is a passion for life and freedom, exuberant joy, and wisdom through a spirited whimsey. This represents the best of life for me and what I most want to share. I hope to engage the viewers imagination as well as their minds, enabling them to make their own surprising discoveries within this unique world.”

Great Travel Washcloth  
We love this very fast drying, extra long wash cloth from Japan! It is machine washable, softer than loofah, but still textured to use in the same way to stimulate circulation. Feels great and lathers well. It is 35 inches long, so also great for back massage. A real luxury in a small size and price!

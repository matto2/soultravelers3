As I took in this balmy blue view today with swaying palm trees at our latest [tropical travel home](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical travel home penang") base, soaking in some [sun for it's health benefits](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/sun-for-its-health-benefits-.html "sun for health benefits") and free vitamin D, I realized again how much I enjoy [escaping winter in tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/tropical-winter-vacation-from-freezing-to-flipflops.html "escapting winter- tropical vacation").  
  
It is always summer here on the equator, so you can see why it seems surreal when I see friends posting photos of snow storms on Facebook or talk to our friends in [Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/05/barcelona-beach.html "barcelona") who tell us it is only 3 degrees there and snow nearby. Wow!  
  
I really do not like cold weather, but I was a bit afraid before coming here, that it would be too hot and muggy for me. It certainly is tropical, and I wouldn't want to be working all day in the hot sun here, but lounging at the pool or playing on the large water slide here with my kiddo, taking the air conditioned [buse](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/getting-around-penang-by-bus.html "buses in Penang")s or going to the air conditioned [malls](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/tropical-christmas-abroad-in-asia.html "christmas in Asia"), mostly makes me forget the heat.  
  
We've spent a total of a year and 7 months here ( with [extended trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "extended trips RTW family") elsewhere in between) and have never needed or used air conditioning in our [homes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "apartment Penang"). The sea breeze, fans and being on a high floor with open windows keeps things cool.  
  
Still adjusting our routines to our new home and settling in, (more photos and details coming soon), but I thought you'd like this peek. A cheap tropical life is quite comfy here!

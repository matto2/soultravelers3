Love, Abundance, Joy!!  
  
What are your dreams for  
the new year? Who doesn't want  
more peace love joy and abundance?

<!--more--> ![dazzling new year, new you and shift for planet peace and love](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee6dba276970d.jpg)  
  
What are your [dreams](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/12/sahara-dream.html "Sahara Dreams") for the new year? Who doesn't want more [peace love](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/world-peace-love-and-happiness.html "world peace, love and happiness") joy and abundance? We have had such amazing healing, blessings and miracles of late, I am thinking [this shift](http://theshiftnetwork.com/main "love shift for planet earth") many have been [talking about](http://www.sfgate.com/business/prweb/article/Three-Days-of-Love-A-Global-Celebration-of-Love-4128776.php "global love celebration") has truly brought some special new energy to our planet which we all need.  
  
" And now let us believe in a long year that is given to us, new, untouched, full of things that have never been." Rilke

I felt it, but whether you did or not, doesn't matter. Why not embrace the positive focus as there is nothing to lose and everything to gain. Life is just a fantasy, so one might as well win in our own fantasies. Seeing ourselves and our planet in greater peace and harmony seems like the ultimate fantasy.

We had one of the best New Year Eve's of my life. Movies are part of the fun of [tropical Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "south east Asia tropical winter rental"), so we saw a double feature of [The Hobbit](http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/movies/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-by-peter-jackson.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 "THe Hobbit") and [Les Miserables](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/movies/les-miserables-on-film-cameron-mackintoshs-dream.html?pagewanted=all "Les Mis") and especially loved the latter with it's theme of love conquers all. Decadently fun to see two movies in luxury so cheap and we brought our [healthy popcorn](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/how-to-make-healthy-popcorn.html "how to make healthy popcorn") with us! Then when we returned home their was an amazing, unexpected fireworks display over the [Andaman Sea](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/serene-azure-andaman-sea-1.html "Andaman sea") that we watched from our [Penang apartment](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Penang rental apartment cheap") terrace. Priceless!  
  
I didn't take a phone or camera with me, so I don't have photos of our fun night out, but when we returned this local newspaper was in the lobby and captured my feelings exactly. A dazzling New Year indeed! No not a fancy New Year's Eve, but a perfect one for a [traveling family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling family") made of [simple pleasures,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/05/lifes-simple-pleasures.html "simple treasures") lots of hugs, cuddles and [inspiration](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/morning-inspirational-quotes-and-sunrise-photo.html "inspirational quotes").  
  
I loved this quote by Maya Angelou that reminds me of the same things the two videos ( by old, dear friends of mine that I've known over 30 some years) express and what the movies said to me.  
  
"In 2012 nature and the mad nature of some human beings caused us to wonder how can we go on. From super storm Sandy to the Colorado movie house shooting and the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, we have been pressed to find some answers to the question, why, me why us, why now? As we come into 2013, we bring with us the need to find answers and the hope to find what can we do to prevent the recurrence of these despairing occurrences. I think we must commit to a commitment to all human beings and a decision to accept our responsibility to nature's outpouring and human misbehavior. I wish that we could say with Horace Mann that each of us should be "ashamed to die until you have won some victory for mankind." I think we must surrender the despair of unexpected cruelty and extend the wonder of unexpected kindnesses to ourselves and to each other. 2013 can bring us the chance to be kind to each other and kind to ourselves. We deserve each other and each other's generosity." Maya Angelou  
  
Perhaps some of my extra enthusiasm is from the [magical trip to China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-family-vacation-beauty-love-joy-.html "family vacation china - magical trip") that we took at the end of the year where everyone we met seemed to have a deep [Lao Tzu connectio](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/confusius-temple-in-beijing-and-tcm-tourism.html#more "Lao Tzu")n ( one of my heroes). Or the mind-blowing Living in Grace retreat I took online hooked up with old friends [in California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "top destinations in California") and amazing souls/friends around the planet ( Japan, France, London, Hawaii, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Australia, South America  etc)  thanks to skype webcam calls and our very cool, innovative, interactive church.  
  
Last year at this time I was at deaths door, in horrific pain with a mysterious [health problem](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traveling-while-sick-or-with-health-medical-challenges.html "traveling when sick") that had debilitated me for years, ( so not able to do [around the world family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "around the world family travel") or even catch a plane), with a sister in the hospital with pnuemonia and an 84 year old mother with a broken collarbone.  
  
There was no place to go but up! I am grateful for all the lessons learned and even the hardships and pain that strengthened me. I am grateful for my beloved family and how they support me through thick and thin. I am grateful to you wonderful readers and the amazing people I meet through this blog.We met with a wise reader and her gifted son on New Year's Day who were in town from Hong Kong.  
  
Life is a gift and 2012 taught me more about how precious it is and how love never fails me. I am going for even more healing, loving, abundance, peace, joy and freedom this year.  
  
How about you?

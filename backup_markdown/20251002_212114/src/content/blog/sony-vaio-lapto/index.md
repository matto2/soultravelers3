Sony VAIO Laptop PC  
We have been very happy with this laptop PC. It is less intuitive than the Macs, but we are really glad that we have it with us as there are times that one can only use a PC. My big concern about PC's is the tendency towards viruses even with strong firewalls and using Firefox and such. So we primarily use it for Mozart's educational software programs and Skype. For some reason, Skype seems to work better sometimes on the PC than on the Macs. We bought a lot of software for Mozart before leaving and some just do not seem to work on the Macs even when they are suppose to.

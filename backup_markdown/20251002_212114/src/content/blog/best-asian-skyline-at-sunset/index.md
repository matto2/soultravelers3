Who doesn't love a beautiful sunset, the perfect ending to a great day? I love this painterly view of our skyline here in [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "Penang our rental home"). Perhaps I am prejudiced, but I think it's one of the prettiest in Asia.  
  
( Our daughter is now off for two weeks, having just finished her Mid-Terms here at her [Mandarin school in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "mandarin school in Penang"), so I am going to try to mostly do just photo posts during this time for the armchair travelers, so that we can have more family time. I know many of you are also busy with back to school preparations, so hopefully this will beÂ  good for all. )  
  
Happy Weekend!

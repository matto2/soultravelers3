A Grand Canyon [family adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate family adventure") with it's ravishing visual beauty, incredible geological treasures and spectacular sweeping panoramas will impress young and old. There is just too much to tell and show in one post, so I will be writing much more about this first stop on our [Southwest](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/winter-road-trip-americas-southwest-.html "southwest road trip") winter [road trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/01/road-trip-usa-best-of-the-west.html "best of west American road trip") traveling some of [historic Route 66](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/historic-route-66-.html "historic route 66") in four states.

Five million people visit the Grand Canyon every year from around the world and I wanted to make sure our [most well=traveled kid](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/the-most-well-traveled-child-in-the-whole-world.html "most well traveled kid") got a chance to see this amazing world wonder and sacred place.  
  
![Grand Canyon and USA flag south rim photo](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a3fcb4671f970b.png)  
  
Even [full time world travelers](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "full time world travelers") like us, have trouble getting every place in, as the world is big with endless delights to discover, but we do our best and are happy to be doing more [traveling in the USA.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-usa.html "traveling in the USA road trip")

The Grand Canyon has been a family travel favorite since our great-grandfather's day when most arrived by train as chronicled in Judy Garland's movie , [The Harvey Girls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIEzMBEOkAc "Harvey Girls").  
  
We were blessed to be hosted by the [Grand Canyon Railway Hotel](http://www.thetrain.com/offers-packages/ "Grand Canyon railway hotel")  and the [Kachina Lodge](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/kachina-lodge-410.html "Kachina Lodge at Grand Canyon"), both amazing and very family friendly places I will write more about. Waking up to a panoramic Grand Canyon sunrise on the rim from your bed? Priceless!  
  
![Grand Canyon with no crowds - tips](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a51163f99a970c.png)  
  
  
I have written before about [how to avoid crowds](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/how-to-travel-without-crowds-in-high-season-finding-bargains-peace-value-away-from-tourist-areas-tip.html "how to avoid crowds when traveling") when traveling, and the secret to that at the Grand Canyon is WHEN you go. It is most crowded in the summer ( when I first saw it many years ago), but in January we had it almost all to ourselves.

As you can see, we ran into gorgeous, sunny weather which was even quite warm for winter and during the heat of the day, we only needed a long sleeve shirt, although our down jackets were handy when the sun went down or early morning.

We talked to visitors who had visited before in October when it was fogged in and August when it rained, and I remember the heat and crowds during my first visit in the summer season, so felt blessed to see the Canyon at it's most beautiful.

The blanket of snow left from the week before just added to the charm for Mozart who didn't miss a chance to play in it and give thanks for this opportunity.

The Grand Canyon National Park is huge and emcompasses 1.2 million acres. The Canyon is 27 miles long and averages 10 miles wide.

The unique architecture and native American history of the [Hopi House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_House "Hopi House grand canyon"), [Look Out Studio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookout_Studio "look out studio grand canyon") ( built in 1905 by Mary Jane Colter) and the [El Tovar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Tovar_Hotel "El Tovar grand canyon") ( also built in 1905 by Charles Whittlesey), as well as Verkamp's Visitor Center, added greatly to our [learning adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "learning adventure or world school unschool benefits").

The Grand Canyon should be a must-see on every travelers bucket list and perhaps even more so if you [travel with kids](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "why travel with kids") and can use it as a [worldschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world school and travel") or [homeschool educational field trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool and world travel"). Lots more photos and details coming to help you plan your own trip or do some arm chair travel!

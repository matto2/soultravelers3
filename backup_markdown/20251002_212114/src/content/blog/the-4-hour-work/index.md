The 4-Hour Workweek  
If you want to find some great ways to work less and enjoy life more, then this is the book for you! We prefer early retirement to his mini-retirements, but find lots of his advice very helpful for extended travel and finding a greater balance between work life and family life. His philosophy and helpful outside-of-the-box ideas will resonate with most and spark a new way of thinking about work and play. His subtitle says it all: "Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and join the New Rich"!

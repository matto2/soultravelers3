The Random House Book of Poetry for Children  
Mozart has had a lot of fun with this book this past winter in Spain doing reading out loud sessions with our 11 year old neighbor who is here often on play dates. It is a large book so is only available to her in the winter. We had lots of poetry books at home, but had to trim them down and I picked this one mainly because it was edited by Jack Prelutsky who was her favorite poet when she was little.

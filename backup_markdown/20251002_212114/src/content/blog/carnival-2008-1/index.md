We were surprised by the extent of the celebrations when we first arrived,  
for such a small village. I love how the whole village participates in the festivals.  
This is our second winter here and we are grateful to be part of this  
community. This quote says it all:  
  
"Spain in general and Andalusia in particular teaches us that you can have no  
real communal life unlessyou have focal and celebratory events throughout the  
year, in which the large majority of people in that community participate.  
That is because the only true basis of community is not supposedly enlightened  
self-interest but actual shared experience.This is much assisted by the  
preservation of pre-industrial feasts and saints' days and by a due attention  
to the rhythms of the seasons".

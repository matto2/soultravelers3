This is the first view of Arles  
that we saw as we crossed  
the bridge to explore it.

This is the first view of [Arles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arles) that we saw as we crossed the bridge to explore it.  
We found it to be a very charming town in the [south of France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/stunning-horses-in-the-camargue-france-family-travel-ideal-vacation-holiday-saintes-maries-de-la-mer.html#tp) and loved  
the [Roman ruins and arena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arles,_Roman_and_Romanesque_Monuments) which are UNESCO world heritage sites.  
We'll be posting more photos and stories about our family travel in lovely Arles,  
France and more of our third trip [exploring Provence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arles,_Roman_and_Romanesque_Monuments) on our [family world trip.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html#tp)  
A quick peek while we roam!

brought a little bit excitement to all. [Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2015/02/teen-mozart-singing-red-carpet-grammys.html "teen mozart singing grammy red carpet") had to rush out

and make some snowballs. I grew up in Michigan and lived in NYC, so I've seen my share of snowstorms, but

NEVER saw such a little bit close down everything. Schools are closed, offices are closed.

I guess everyone is out making snowmen!

Dallas has no snow machines to clear the roads since snow is a rarity here. I've read they don't use salt because the cars here are not protected from it. Roads are a hazard now.

So a little bit of snow, topped with sleet and cold temps brings everything to a halt in a place where we were just wearing shorts about a week ago! It will melt soon. Who is ready for Spring?

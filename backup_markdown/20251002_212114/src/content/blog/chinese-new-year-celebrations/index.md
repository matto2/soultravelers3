[Chinese New Year celebrations in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/02/chinese-new-year-in-asia.html "Chinese New Year Celebrations") are colorful, thrilling and full of merriment! One of the great joys of [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") and [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world schooling") at a [Chinese school in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/chinese-school-in-asia-11-year-old-american-doing-physics-in-mandarin.html "Chinese school in Asia") on our 7 year [world trip](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/around-the-world-family-travel.html "family world trip around the world RTW"), is to be able to [learn Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/learning-mandarin-in-beijing-china-best-school.html "Learn Mandarin in Beijing") like a native and participate fully with the Chinese community.

Partly because 12 year old Mozart was a finalist ( and youngest) in the singing competition last year at her 1000 kid [high school in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "Chinese high school Penang"), she was picked again to be a [featured singer ( in Mandarin)](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "featured singer in Mandarin - American singer") in her very large choir.  
  
She loves to sing and preform, so what a fun way to [learn Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/mandarin-chinese-learning-at-home-and-abroad.html "learn mandarin abroad") more deeply as well as the [Chinese culture](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/chines.html "Chinese culture immersion") and bond with friends. Yep, she is the tiny, only blond in front ( since she is the [only American in the school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "only amercian in Chinese school")).  
  
Just as her [flamenco and Christmas recital](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/12/flamenco-christ.html "flamenco school recital Spain") at her [school in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "school in Spain") was unique, so was this and NOT something an American kid usually experiences..[world school](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world school at it's best") at it's best!  
  
![Chinese New Year celebration - dragon dance](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017d40f9e71f970c.jpg)  
  
All the kids put on a fabulous show on their last day of school before the holiday began. From the dragon dancers...  
  
![Chinese New Year celebration - drums](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c36cad010970b.jpg)  
  
to the amazing drumming group!  
  
![Chinese New Year celebration - traditional Chinese instruments](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017ee86e12cb970d.jpg)  
They also had two orchestras that preformed well, both a symphony as well as this close up shows, one dedicated to traditional Chinese music and instruments.  
  
![Chinese New Year celebration - Thailand dancers](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a95078833017c36cb4947970b.jpg)  
  
Two thirds of the students are local Chinese Malaysians, but the rest are foreigners mostly from Asia ( most stay in the dorms at the school), so they also had this group of Thailand dancers. There was more of course, but we couldn't get photos of everything.  
  
What a fabulous way to start our [Chinese New Year celebrations in Georgetown](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/20-stunning-photos-chinese-new-year-georgetown-penang.html "Chinese New Year in Georgetown, Penang - stunning photos")! More coming as we join in the festivities around the town for the next two weeks. I will be getting up my [amazing Thaipusam](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/thaipusam-2013.html "Thaispusam 2013") photos as well!

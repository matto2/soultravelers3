We take this literally, so planning our [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschool family travel tips") family [European tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/grand-tour-europe-iv-family-travel-extended-vacation-road-trip-summer-holiday-abroad.html "family European tour") to explore more of the richness of our favorite continent, next on our [unschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/home-school-science-unschool-and-world-school-tips.html "unschool and science")/[worldschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school or unschool") agenda.  
  
Can a [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/07/homeschool-high-school-and-world-travel.html "homeschool high school and world travel") family on a budget afford [Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/best-places-to-visit-in-europe.html "best places to visit in Europe") and take advantage of the [endless educatonal opportunities](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/travel-schooling-learning-through-travel.html "travel schooling - learning through travel") there? Absolutely, if one [plans](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/road-trip-europe-plan-then-improvise.html "road trip europe plan") ahead, does [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel ") and lives like a local.  
  
**HOMESCHOOL FAMILY TRAVEL ON A BUDGET**

**SECRETS TO TRAVELING EUROPE WITH KIDS**  
  
Having spent 5 years [traveling Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/travelling-traveling-around-europe-in-a-campervan.html "traveling Europe in a campervan, RV, motorhome"), on our [world tour](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "amazing family world tour RTW"), we know it well, exploring more of Europe than most Europeans. [Visiting Paris](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/paris-travel-with-kids.html "visiting Paris with kids") at 5 is very different than at 10 or 13, so always good reasons to return for a deeper experience on our [ultimate famly adventure](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "ultimate family adventure tips").

**HOMESCHOOL AND TRAVEL**  
  
[Homeschooling and travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/home-school-kids-travel.html "homeschool and travel") are a perfect pair and going slow enriches families, is cheaper, more educational, better for [language learning](http://soultravelers3new.local/language-learning/ "language learning tips") and prevents [travel burnout](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/how-to-prevent-travel-burnout.html "travel burn out prevention"). We learn more every time we go.

**LIVING LIKE A LOCAL ON EUROPE VACATION**  
  
[Visiting Barcelona](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/costa-brava-and-barcelona.html "visiting Barcelona") 18 plus times in 8 years, (often for months at a time), with [dear friends](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "living like a local in Barcelona") who are locals, makes it one of "homes" and a very different experience than doing a holiday or vacation week or getaway weekend there.

**ADDING LANGUAGES WITH TRAVEL**  
  
Having spent several recent years [based in Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "learning Mandarin in Asia") for [Mandarin fluency](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "Fluent Mandarin"), we are missing our [Spanish "homes"](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html "Spanish home for winter rental") and friends in Europe. [Trilingual Mozart](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/04/growing-up-bilingual-or-trilingual.html "growing up bilingual or trilingual") wants to add French to her languages and graduate to a fluent quadrilingual.

**CAMPING IN EUROPE BEST FOR FAMILIES**  
  
[Camping in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/camping-europe/ "camping Europe tips") is fabulous, cheap and luxurious. We think buying our [motorhome in Europe](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/motorhoming-travels-in-europe-.html#more "motorhome travels in Europe") in 2005 was one of our wisest choices on our world tour and it makes a great home/vehicle/storage unit to explore with and keep in Europe.

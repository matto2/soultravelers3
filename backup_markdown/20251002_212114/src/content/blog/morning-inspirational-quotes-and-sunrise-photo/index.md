Morning has broken and a new day , a new week greets us. Things have speeded up in our [travel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/amazing-family-world-tour.html "travel lifestyle for digital nomad family")  world as we are doing last minute prep for our trip to China, thus my posts will likely be shorter for a while with mostly photos. I love sharing these sunrise photos with you and inspiring quotes so hope you enjoy them too.  
  
“I will greet this day with love in my heart. And how will I do this? Henceforth will I look on all things with love and be born again. I will love the sun for it warms my bones; yet I will love the rain for it cleanses my spirit. I will love the light for it shows me the way; yet I will love the darkness for it shows me the stars. I will welcome happiness as it enlarges my heart; yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul. I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; yet I will welcome obstacles for they are my challenge.” ~ Og Mandino  
  
"Being loving is the greatest gift you can give yourself and others. There is nothing in your life - or anyone else's - that loving cannot heal." - John-Roger  
  
"Don’t ever shrink your **dream** [](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dream&src=hash)to fit into someone else’s definition of what’s possible." ~  Goodwin

In an age like ours, which is not given to letter-writing, we forget what an important part it used to play in people's lives.  ~Anatole Broyard  
  
Recently, we got a bunch of care packages from home that my sweet 84 year old [mother](http://soultravelers3new.local/2007/02/worlds-best-mot.html "world's best mother") has been busy sending us at my request. You might remember from my [travel and health](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/healthy-food-and-travel.html "travel and health")  or [organic food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "organic food and travel health") posts, that I brought a ton of supplements with me this time due to my recent [health challenges](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "health challenges on the road while traveling or living abroad"). Well, I ran out and some things one just can't get here, despite some [good organic stores](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/where-to-buy-organic-food-in-penang.html "organic stores penang") and [cheap hospitals](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/penang-best-hospitals-great-health-care-at-low-cost.html "good cheap hospitals penang").  
  
I've heard from several people ( unlike our [winters in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/whats-a-spain-winter-rental-like-extended-travel-digital-nomad-4hww-vacation-.html "winters in spain")) that sometimes mail and especially larger packages never arrive in [Malaysia](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/typical-malaysia-local-style.html "Malaysia").  Thus, I made sure that all my packages were small as I didn't want any of the expensive ones to land in customs or stolen.

What a wonderful thing is the mail, capable of conveying across continents a warm human hand-clasp.  ~Author Unknown  
  
The joy for Ms. Mozart ( who got use to [reading the newspaper](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/old-media-is-dying-a-photo-essay.html "reading newspapers ") with Grandma) is she gets to receive all kinds of goodies like comics, articles, stickers, little gifts and cards from her perky, golfing, [traveling Grandmother](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/traveling-with-grandma-3-generation-travel.html "traveling grandmother") that she misses. Another way to [stay connected to family](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/how-to-stay-connected-with-family-while-you-travel-around-the-world.html "stay connected to family while abroad"), despite being about 9000 miles apart. It also gives them something fun to discuss in email and on Skype web cam calls.

We have a small mailbox here, so at first we were just getting notices to pick the packages up at the main post office. This was a trek and half by bus for poor hubs, but worth the effort, as he gets lots of hugs and kisses upon return.  Lately, ( and perhaps a new mailman, we are not sure why) we have been finding them on our door to [our apartment](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/finding-a-vacation-rental-apartment-in-penang-2.html "our apartment in Penang") on a high floor. Yesterday, I got seven more packages, added to the 16 we have already received. Yea!!  
  
So far they have all gotten here, so I am gaining more faith in the Malaysia mailing system. There are many advantage to our almost paperless, [3-laptop family world lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/10/the-traveling-o.html "3 laptop family world travel lifestyle") and we can do almost everything via our laptops, but sometimes, good old fashion snail mail can be a blessing from home that comforts and meets needs.  
  
Have you ever gotten a care package from home when you've been living at a distance? Or mailed a care package to loved ones abroad?

"The most important thing is to enjoy your life-to be happy- it's all that matters" Audrey Hepburn  
  
In this season of [consumption](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/reverse-culture-shock-usa-over-consumerism.html "over consumption usa"),  it's easy to forget what is important in life amongst all the hustle and bustle and negative stories in the news and [online.](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "importance of unplugging")  It's so important to remember that [peace](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/world-peace-love-and-happiness.html "peace") is always present as is joy, [Grace](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/unplugged-todays-best-luxury-.html "grace and gratitude") and happiness, but sometimes life makes it harder to hold that positive focus.  
  
 "Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance" I Corinthians 13:17  
  
So when we saw this beautiful sign in traditional [Chinese Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "best way to learn Mandarin")n that said "happiness" so beautifully while we were in [China](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/12/china-family-vacation-beauty-love-joy-.html "China vacation") recently, we made sure we got a photo of us with it. When life throws us a curve ball, we have yet another tool to bring us back to our gratitude, Grace and happiness. Reminding us once again that over [22 years](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/10/celebrating-in-paris-eiffel-tower-family-travel-adventures-abroad-birthdays-weddings-and-anniversari.html "anniversary celebration Paris") ago, DaVinci and I [committed to co-creating heaven on earth](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/happy-20th-wedding-anniversary.html "wedding anniversary") with God and committing to a soul in our marriage vows that we wanted to raise the best we could and create a happy family.  
  
We just got some sad news from home and we have another deeply loved one who is going through her first Christmas without her beloved husband who died young a few months ago and a sister in a wheel chair now with a mysterious degenerative dis-ease. They say a mother is only as happy as her unhappiest child, but I find when my loved ones are in pain, it is harder for me to keep my happiness.  
  
But I also see that is when we need to keep it the most, when life is the most challenging to us, our loved ones or the world.  
  
I can't change all the bad things, but I can keep my focus on gratitude for all our blessings. As bad as things can be, they could always be worse, so I like to look at the blessings even in the hardships and challenges.  
  
Last year at [Christmas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/california-christmas-break-news.html "christmas blessings") I was so sick, ( and had been [so sick](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/health-organic-raw-foods-and-travel.html "eating organic raw foods while traveling") and in [pain for so long](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/09/-a-travelers-tragic-tale-handling-travel-disasters-medical-emergency-.html "pain for so long"))  I knew that if I didn't change things around that I would die, so I am so very grateful to my [travel health secrets](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/09/travel-health-secrets-for-long-term-digital-nomads.html "travel health secrets") and [health  tips](http://soultravelers3new.local/health-and-travel/ "health tips"), [TCM](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/10/traditional-chinese-medicine-in-asia.html "tcm chinese traditional medicine "), natural supplements, diet etc that have allowed me now to feel healthier than I have in years.  
  
Even though I suffered with lots of severe pain, I can see that also as a blessing in how it strengthened me and all of us and taught us many things through the process that has also allowed me to help others.  
  
I am so grateful to our family and YOU readers who have always supported us. Wishing you many blessings this holiday season and the year ahead.

Here are some happiness quotes to help us all to remember, no matter what, to keep our eyes on the good.  
  
**_"Do not think of a painful experience as a dark time in your life. You emerge out of everything learning something or becoming a better person. You realize who your real friends are and how much your loved ones mean_** **_to you."_**  **_Colleen Ho  
  
_****_"When we feel love and_** **_kindness towards others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace."  Dalai Lama_****_"I have never met a person whose greatest need was anything other than real, unconditional love. It is our connection to God and to each other.''  Kubler-Ross_**  
  
**_“Happiness is the consequence of personal effort. You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it. You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it.”_** **_Elizabeth Gilbert_**  
  
**_“People are often unreasonable and self-centered. Forgive them anyway._**  
**_If you are kind, people may accuse you of ulterior motives. Be kind anyway._**  
**_If you are honest, people may cheat you. Be honest anyway._**  
**_If you find happiness, people may be jealous. Be happy anyway._**  
**_The good you do today may be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway._**  
**_Give the world the best you have and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway._**  
**_For you see, in the end, it is between you and God. It was never between you and them_**  **_anyway.”_** **_Mother_** **_Teresa__“With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,_**  
**_it is still a beautiful world._**  
**_Be cheerful._**  
**_Strive to be happy.”_ _Max Ehrmann_**

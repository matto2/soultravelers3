Clear turquoise water, palm trees,  
sea breezes, walking barefoot on  
the white sand, relaxing in the sun

Clear turquoise water, palm trees, sea breezes, walking barefoot on the white sand, [relaxing in the sun](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/sun-for-its-health-benefits-.html "sun health benefits") by the pool is the perfect [tropical travel dream](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/florida-family-vacation-fun.html "tropcial travel dream Florida vacation") for someone who wants to escape a cold winter. Brrr, before the winter blues set in and with the [holidays just around the corner](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/12/christmas-holiday-travel-ideas-for-family-getaways.html "christmas holiday getaway vacation ideas"), perhaps it's time to plan that [winter getaway!](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/01/florida-sun-winter-getaway.html "winter getaway florida") You don't have to live a t[ravel lifestyle](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/07/what-our-nomadic-travel-lifestyle-looks-like-family-fun.html "travel lifestyle") like us to enjoy this perk.  
  
I grew up in Michigan with extremely long, cold winters with endless snow shoveling, frost bitten fingers and toes plus getting into freezing cars each morning with icy windows. Sure, some if it was fun for a kid at [Christmas time](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/12/how-to-enjoy-family-travel-abroad-at-christmas-digital-nomad-4hww-extended-travel-holidays.html "christmas abroad tips"),  but my happiest memories were [Florida road trips](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/10/florida-road-trip-sun-fun-family-vacation.html "Florida road trip") with my family a few times each winter.  
  
This tempting photo was the view from our room balcony at the beautiful  [Westin Diplomat Resort and Spa](http://www.diplomatresort.com/ "westin diplomat resort and spa") - a spectacular beachfront surf and sand location. Some how this kind of winter ambiance suits me so much more than snow. Spring at least, should arrive immediately after a white Christmas in my imagination.

The older I get, the less I want to deal with long winters of cold or rain, so thanks to our [early retirement and perpetual travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/early-retirement-perpetual-travel-radical-early-retirement-with-kids-rtw-family-travel-multiyear.html "early retirement and perpetual travel"), we haven't done winters any colder than [southern Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/11/lifestyle-design-a-winter-in-spain-extendedtravel-digitalnomad-miniretirement-4hww-travel.html "southern spain") or [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/08/top-10-california-destinations.html "California"). I must admit, now that I am use to [tropical winters in Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/tropical-winter-home-in-penang-malaysia-location-indenpendent-digital-nomad-long-term-travel-tips-.html "tropical winters in Penang"), even [Mediterranean winters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "mediterranean winters") seem a bit cold to me.  
  
What is great about both [Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/best-southern-spain-holiday.html "southern spain holiday or vacation") and [California](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/beautiful-capitola-californias-oldest-beach.html "california beach") is one can enjoy the sunny beaches as well as winter skiing in the mountains at the same time. I can handle snow in small doses for skiing, so we plan to do that a bit when we head off to China soon for [deep immersion into Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/07/learning-mandarin-in-asia-the-economist-and-wall-street-journal-discuss-.html "learning mandarin in Asia"). But it will be another happy [tropical Christmas](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/12/tropical-christmas-abroad-in-asia.html "tropical Christmas in Asia") for us!  
  
Where is your favorite winter getaway?

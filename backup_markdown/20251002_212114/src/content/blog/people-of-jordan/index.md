One of the best things about a [trip to Jorda](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/05/jordan-family-travel-is-it-safe.html "trip to Jordan")n are the warm, welcoming people known to give travelers some of the most generous hospitality in the world. The majority of Jordan's 4.4 million people are of Arabic decent with most being of [Bedouin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/02/bedouins-in-jordan.html "Bedouin") origin and Muslim, but about 6% are Christian. There are other minorities as well from Russial, Armenia and Palestine.  
  
You see people dressed in western clothes everywhere in Jordan, but as a photographer, I am more interested in capturing the people who dress in traditional clothes. One of the things we like to do is get a traditional outfit for our child to help her connect to a culture and she wore a Bedouin outfit when we [visited Petra](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/family-vacation-petra-wow-.html "Visiting Petra with kids").  
  
You can tell a lot about [Jordanian culture by the food](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/03/jordan-means-delicious-food.html "Jordanian food") and markets and we love the [colorful street life in Jordan](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/colorful-street-life-jordan.html "colorful street life in Jordan"). We stopped at a small market along the road in a rural area and met this man. I thought in many ways he represents the spirit of Jordan.  
  
What do you think? Do Americans have false impressions of Arabic dress and culture?

October 12, 2006

The Australian family that we met on our  
last day of Paris could not stop raving  
about Lyons and a park there.

The Australian family that we met on our last day of Paris could not stop raving about Lyons and a park there. So Mozart and DaVinci took a bus and two metros there (about an hour away) to check it out while I caught up with the blog and got it ready to upload.

We slept in late,DaVinci made one of his famous breakfasts, we did extra home school, so a late start was guaranteed. But, we needed a more relaxed day today. They found the very unique playground,made some friends, saw the giraffes and animals, had late lunch and waffles by the lake, fed the deer and just played, played and played some more. She wanted to watch “Parent Trap” when she came home  because all the vineyards made her think of one of the girls who lives on a vineyard. Taking a young child around the world, means getting to know playgrounds and parks around the world and its really quite nice.

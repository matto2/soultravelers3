Soon after her 13th birthday in [Sydney](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/11/stunning-sydney-view.html "Sydney trip"), Mozart played Mozart and more at a recital in [Asia](http://soultravelers3new.local/asia/ "ASIA TRAVEL TIPS") at the international school in [Penang](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/06/why-learn-mandarin-in-tropical-asia-penang.html "WHY LEARN MANDARIN CHINESE IN PENANG") where she was doing  [homeschool](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "HOMESCHOOL AND TRAVEL") electives.  
  
**TALENTED TEEN MUSICIAN AND SINGER/SONGWRITER**  
  
Mozart is a [talented teen singer/songwriter](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/tween-is-a-talented-singer-songwriter.html "talented teen singer and songwriter Mozart") and musician who plays violin, piano ( from 2 and 3 years old) guitar, didgeridoo, has a 4 octave voice and loves to perform, but this is not easy combined with our non-stop [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/09/why-travel-with-kids-kid-traveling-the-world-for-8-years-tells.html "TRAVEL THE WORLD WITH KIDS") lifestyle.

**PERFECT PITCH, GREAT EAR, ADVANCED MUSIC THEORY AT JHU-CTY**  
  
She recently got an A on an advanced high school music theory class online through Johns Hopkins University CTY with [Dr. Jolie Lin](http://jolielin.com/about-jolie/ "dr Jolie Lin pianist") ( PhD from the prestigious Peabody Conservatory ) who said to Mozart, "I hope you continue in music as you are very musical".  
  
**MOZART LOVES TO PERFORM**  
  
She was thrilled with this opportunity to perform, so we are sharing it with you:

**CHALLENGES OF RAISING A CREATIVE, MUSICAL CHILD**  
  
Not only does the [world travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/12/kid-world-citizens-inspiring-speech-at-global-education-conference.html "world travel kid Mozart speech"), [minimalism](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/08/minimalist-living-family-travel-lifestyle-books.html "minimalist family tips"), and tight budget make it more challenging to support Mozart's musical talents, but neither of us parents play instruments or have musical training. Yet we try  to support her passion for [music as we roam the globe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9rDTZj-m4 "music kid around the world").  
  
**SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH WOLFGANG ARMADEUS MOZART**  
  
She is the only kid since Wolfgang Armadeus Mozart to do extensive world travel with a violin and piano and now we have added guitar and didgeridoo! I must admit her daily practice is often one of my favorite times of the day.  
  
She also sang Pie Jesu beautifully like an angel, but alas, we had a malfunction with our equipment, so will try to record that again another time soon.  
  
![Mozart singing at 13](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a511735c27970c.png)  
  
 Most of the students did just one instrument and one piece, but Mozart didn't want to miss the opportunity to perform three disciplines and she was the only singer.  
  
She also got to do a lead in a play with a singing part while at that International School which she also adored doing.  
  
![Mozart with curly hair and rose after performance in Asia](https://pub-ac94b3f306b24c0dba4238943c97f2e1.r2.dev/6a00e5502a9507883301a73d7e9c9b970d.png)  
  
  
**FEARLESS KID**  
  
We are proud of our courageous, artistic little girl and always a little astounded by her fearlessness to share herself in front of a crowd, whether it is [public speaking](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "public speaking - kid mandarin ted talk"), [singing](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/04/earth-day-song-solo-and-1st-place.html "singing talented kid wins!") or playing music around the world.   
  
These opportunities are always initiated by Mozart, so that gives us the impetus to support her and understand her needs. Her passion for performance and music seems to keep increasing as she grows. She mananaged to practice for this recital as we were traveling quite fast on another continent and also sang in Mandarin around the same time at a huge Chinese wedding ( video coming).

**TEEN MUSICIAN**  
  
It was her idea to try our [mother-daughter bonding](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/mother-daughter-bonding-tips-for-tweens.html "mother-daughter bonding") hair-do that makes her hair all wavy after a day of braids in the "10" look and she excitedly got her first pair of "wedgies" ( with small heel)  to perform ( always the [fashionista](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/05/how-to-be-a-world-traveling-fashionista.html "fashionista world traveler")).  We were so sorry her hair covered her face in the piano piece, but live and learn. At least you can see how much she feels the music.  
  
She was joyfully rewarded with a rose and was grateful for the experience, camaraderie with friends who also love music and a chance to prepare and share music from her heart.  
  
Do you have a creative child who loves music and art? How do you support them?

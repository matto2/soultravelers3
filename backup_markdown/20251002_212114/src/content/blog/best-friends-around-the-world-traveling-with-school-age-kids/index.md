Our 11 year old daughter showed me this list that she had doodled in her notebook and it made me smile. She has been [traveling the world](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html "traveling the world as a family") non-stop since she was five and has seen much more of the world than most will ever see in a lifetime ( 44 countries on 5 continents..much of it [slow travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/11/slow-travel.html "slow travel") with time to immerse and reflect).  
  
I adore how she used her three languages in the description..using the [Mandarin](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/01/only-american-girl-in-an-all-mandarin-school-chinese-immersion-in-language-culture-through-school.html "Mandarin school in asia") word for friends and Spanish word for world. Most of the friends on this list, she has been close to for many years.Just this weekend she had a long conversation with her [best friends in Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/06/delicious-dinner-in-barcelona.html "best friends in spain") while in Asia via Skype..keeping current while we are at a distance. Then she was off with international friends here to sing Karoke in several languages.

Our tween is a very social child and her long term friendships as well as her [education](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/the-benefits-of-educational-travel-for-kids.html "education through travel") are very important to us and we didn't want to just have the "bubble" of International schools, but local friends from around the world from every aspect and class who don't move around.  [Eclectic homeschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "Eclectic homeschooling travel") and [dipping into local schools](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/schools-out-forever-expat-immersion-spanish-in-spain-digital-nomad-education-for-kids-who-travel.html "dipping into foreign local schools") in three countries has been enriching for her languages, cultural immersion and social life..returning regularly has made all the difference.

**LONG TERM FRIENDSHIPS FOR A TRAVELING CHILD**  
  
Can traveling kids have deep, consistent friendships? We prove it can be done! Here is how we handle long term friendships as we travel:  
  
[Kids, Friends, Travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2011/02/kids-friends-travel-on-the-ultimate-family-adventure.html "kids friends travel on the ultimate family world trip")  
  
[Can Globe Trotting Location Independent Kids have Friends?](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/05/globe-trotting-location-independent-kids-friends-perpetual-travelers-tck-long-term-family-travel-.html "can globe trotting kids have friends")  
  
I've read recently that studies show that we form our prejudices from three to twelve and I pray her many experiences have opened her mind to all the wonderful people in this world and the so many different ways to do life.  
  
I will be curious to see how these friendships and experiences affect her adult life! Is this cute or what? Sometimes a child's doodling or drawing can tell us a lot about their inner world. What do you think?

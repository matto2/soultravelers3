Wow, we love this campsite and hope we can get some pictures up to show you. We have a perfect spot right on the water and we knew as soon as we pulled over that this one would please us. We have headed out to the beautiful green countryside (still only a short distance from Amsterdam but our furthest trek thus far) to a small town called Edam.

The country side is very green, flat and filled with sheep,cows,ponies, horses and interesting looking houses here and there. Of course we also saw the quintessential windmills dotting the landscape. We need to explore the town soon,but its only walking distance from our campsite and it looks very charming. There are two other interesting towns nearby that we want to explore and we hope to do it by bikes.

As we entered the campgrounds we saw lots of pretty yachts parked outside as they must use the restaurants and facilities as well perhaps. There is a fantastic playground with all kinds of interesting rides and things to play on that are different still from anything we have seen here or at home. There is also a kids pool  
and a roped off section of water for swimming in whatever body of water it is here (not sure). There is a wonderful big slide that goes into that swimming section and lots of canoes or bikes to rent. The restaurant looks pretty fancy with lovely water views filled with sailboats.

There is lots of green grass and we are off on a section kind of by ourselves for nice privacy, yet close to  
the showers and bathrooms. Last night we had 14 ducks nearby that entertained us a little after our pizza dinner with the gorgeous setting sun. This is the kind place we could stay for weeks. We are happy campers!

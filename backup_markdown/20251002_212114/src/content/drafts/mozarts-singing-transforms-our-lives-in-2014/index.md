Have you had a very transformative year? Mozart's singing transformed our lives in 2004, so when I look at our year in review, even in travel terms, Mozart's talents led our adventures. She turned 13 and we were propelled into a new universe.  
  
Our travels have always revolved around Mozart's needs, although we never expected to go in this direction. In 20/20 hindsight, I suppose I should have seen it coming, but I was utterly shocked when we were living in a small town in Malaysia & some of the top TV & Film producers in the world ( based in LA) found her and were interested in her starring in TV shows!

Due to my health issues ( which are much better now!) and all the attention on Mozart, plus a signed contract for a TV show, we quickly decided to leave Asia last December and get some training for Mozart for singing and acting as it has become very clear that this is her calling and destiny.  
  
As a [homeschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "homeschooling and travel")/[unschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/09/how-to-homeschool-through-travel-with-a-gifted-child-.html "unschool or homeschool gifted child ")/ [worldschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/01/world-school-education-at-its-best-.html "world school travel education") family, we are all about supporting her choices and following her lead and right now her biggest passions are singing, songwriting, [music](http://soultravelers3new.local/2014/02/mozart-plays-mozart-and-more-violin-and-piano-performance.html "travel teen Mozart playing violin and piano performance"), dancing, [public speaking,](http://soultravelers3new.local/2013/03/mandarin-ted-talk-american-kids-inspiring-chinese-speech-.html "public speaking") and acting.  
  
That first TV contract didn't reach fruition, but we've since been approached by several other TV projects by top producers, so time will tell where this all will lead. I haven't even had a chance to get an agent yet, as most of this year has felt like we jumped on a very fast moving train and are still trying to get our bearings in this new world.

We had a great Christmas, New Years & winter escape last year with family in California and that was very special, but soon it was time to take off on winter road trip, paleo style.

What a joy to explore the Grand Canyon together and the all-American experience of the Grand Canyon Railway adventure. I think January is the perfect time to go.

Our Southwest roadtrip was a big hit and we all loved Santa Fe. Such a romantic place and the hiking was divine.

Our arrival in Dallas was luxurious at the Four Seasons with golf, swimming & spa time.  
  
We don't know anyone in Dallas, so it's been a surprisingly interesting area to get to know from the Dallas Aboretum, to the Perot Museum and so much more.  
  
  
Mozart starting performing almost as soon as we arrived in late February, like our 13 year old singing Time After Time in March.  
  
  
In May and June, she learned about makeup, sung like a Pop Star at the famous Gas Monkey and did better than 96% of high school kids on her SAT at just 13 ( and only had a month toÂ  study for it)!!  
  
She also did a speech for the Dallas Public Libraries about travel and sang in Mandarin at a Chinese festival in Dallas ChinaTown.  
  
Then,after 3 arduous auditions, she was the youngest ( and least experienced) one to make it into a Masters Singing Class, so we committed to base in Dallas through July 2015. 
  
Mozart decided to pretty much take over our Soultravelers3 Youtube channel in August starting with "China Haul" so she can do travel videos, but also covers, performances, original songs, tutorials, DIY, Cooking, Fashion, makeup etc. She puts up a video every Thursday and has doubled our subscribers since she started.  
  
Over the summer, Mozart worked hard, wrote a lot of songs and learned a ton of popular covers that she could also play keyboard with so that she could perform regularly at trendy spots around town. At 13 she played her first set at her first venue, the amazing, House of Blues!

After her first Youtube video, Mozart was approached by Not Your Mother's Hair to be the youngest reporter at New York Fashion Week which was amazing experience. She even met Vogue's Anna Wintour, tennis star Serena Williams and was photographed on the red carpet.  
  
Mozart also performed a bunch of times at the popular Opening Bell, Six Flags and other places.

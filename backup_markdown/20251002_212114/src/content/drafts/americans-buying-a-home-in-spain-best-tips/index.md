We just bought a new front line  beach home in Spain and love it! Americans buying homes in Europe is up 256% since January 2025 ( via  May Financial Times) and it has been an up trend for a while. Spain, Portugal and Greece are the most popular countries Americans choose to buy homes with paths to EU passports. I will be doing a series of articles about our home buying process to help  guide all who are interested. This is a perfect time to diversify one’s investments

- We love Europe and have been traveling to Spain and Europe for long stays for twenty years, so know it well. As a travel writer, I have used rental cars, camper van. trains, buses, subways, biking and and so much walking  to explore every exciting nook and cranny. The lifestyle suits us well and a beautiful, Costa Durado small  fishing village that is just a fast train ride away from Barcelona,  Tarragona, Reus, Tortosa, Valencia and Madrid, seems like the perfect place for us to retire.  
    
    As I write this, I look out at an exquisite sea view with the sounds of waves and birds chirping in the nearby Palm trees. This makes me  so happy. I once rented an apartment on the first line of the sea in Marina Del Rey, California in the eighties  and loved it, so I promised myself as I left it, that some day I would buy a beach home or flat. I almost forgot that old dream, but when we wintered in Cyprus a few years ago & I walked daily on the beach, I remembered again.
    
      
    
     I thrive on beach living as it brings me joy! Being right on the beach safely, on the first line where you see, hear and smell the sea close up on your balcolny in a semi private way,  is also key for me. I often live & travel close to the sea ( water and mountain combos make me feel sublime), BUT being ON the sea, not just close, makes a huge difference.
    
      
    
    The moment we saw this place and view,  we knew this place fit the “location, location, location” real estate quote.  Views this great and  close to the beach are hard to find, even in Spain or this village. There are a LOT of beach view homes and apartments here, but this location is unique and special.
    
      
    
     It also reminded us of a beloved beach apartment my mom once owned on the front line in Capitola, California. This beach reminds us of Capitola and the beautiful small harbor here reminds us of Santa Cruz ,California. The distant mountain view over the sea reminds us of Kuaua. It is almost like we have so many places we love all in one!
    
      
    
    We are into health and longevity and this place fits that goal so well. Living with a sea view and hearing the sounds of waves improves health and helps one live longer. This is a fantastic place to hike, walk, bike, sail. Spain does such a great job of maintaining their beach areas and making them walkable.
    
      
    
    Like all of Europe coastal places, it does get busy here in July and August they say, but not overly crowded. It is extremely enchanted and peaceful here in spring, summer and winter. We came repeatedly during those months over a few years house hunting. Even now on May weekends and holidays it is quiet. We rented a beach place in this town last November through January and absolutely loved it. Great restaurants, perfect sunny weather almost every day  and always some people but never crowded.
    
      
    
    I love my morning walks here on the beach! The views are spectacular and I love to feel the salt water and sand on my feet. I adore all the many diverse beaches here and nature. Wild flowers, ancient trees, & various landscapes abound. The close next beach over is more secluded and is surrounded by pine and olive trees. There are a few small beaches and then a gorgeous red rock cliff beach. One can hike from that beach to the next town ( about 4 hour hike, or 10 minute drive). One can actually walk along this beautiful coast all the way to France!
    
      
    
    I love this location too because it is very close to France, Andorra and Italy. Plus a fast train ride from anywhere in Spain or Europe. While staying here last winter we drove 3 hours north to celebrate New Years in charming Collioure, France! In the past we loved talking the ferry to Italy from Barcelona and look forward to that again soon! It is also close to Spain’s top wine regions like Priorot which we adore.
    
      
    
    When I walk in the opposite direction on this seaside promenade I head to the wonderful harbor! Of course there are a ton of great restaurants this way too, old olive trees and the sail boats make me smile. There are several beaches in this direction as well.
    
      
    
    There is a famous herb place nearby, the biggest in Europe and beyond that a camping resort with 2 pools and a restaurant. There are some interesting historical things as this was once an ancient Roman port and play grounds and a few restaurants.
    
      
    
    Also very close is the Delta Ebro famous tor flamingos in winter and other nature at the natural park xxx, plus more beaches. This is the longest river in Spain and also an area of rice fields and board walks.
    
      
    
    We’ve been seriously  looking for the right place to buy in Spain for a few years now. We loved living in Andalucia in the enchanting white village  of Frigiliana where we wintered many years ago where Heavenly went to school from 1st - 4th grade. But we have also spent extensive time in Vilanova i la Geltrú for 20 years ( where we park our vintage camper). We decided we wanted Barcelona to be our big city, so looked at places from Costa Brava to Costa Duado.
    
      
    
    We loved the last home we owned which was a rural home and vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. We saw the 2008 crash coming so we sold it in 2006 to explore the world as a family and world school our child in 3 languages. We loved being digital nomad and world school pioneers!
    
      
    
    So we were mostly looking at rural properties in Spain. We also looked in other paces like Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria  and Albania. Since both my husband and child are Spanish heritage and speak Spanish & we love Spain, it made the most sense for us.
    
      
    
    Buying a home is always a stressful experience, experts say and more so in a foreign land. One needs the help of a lawyer and architect to safely buy a home as a foreigner in Spain. Rural homes ( campo) are much difficult to buy than a house or flat in a city or town.
    
      
    
    Unlike the USA, many homes and apartments in Spain stay on the market to buy for many years. Over the last few years, we started to bid on many homes that had been on the market for many years. Strangely, several of them were taken off the market ( after being for sale for years) once we started to bid on them. Apparently, some Spaniards love the idea of the money gained by selling a home, but once they get a bid, they realize they do not actually want to part with their home. This happened to us repeatedly  mainly with rural homes but also with a  big beach apartment in a small town.
    
      
    
    We did learn so much with our long process. I will be sharing all that we learned over time. We also were not in a hurry and wanted maximum benefits at the lowest cost. Thus one could find a house to buy faster than we did.
    
      
    
    We had planned to buy a rural, off grid  home first and then later buy a  beach apartment in a town. We actually found a rural home nearby this winter, but after the fires in Los Angeles, global warming challenges, and with the complications needed with an off grid country home ( well, solar panels, fencing, pool, generator, car needed etc), we decided to start with the beach flat in town. So glad we did!
    
      
    
    We stil  
      
    l plan to buy an off grid country home nearby likely as we love the ancient olive trees here and love having our own small vineyard and grow our own food. This is just a much  easier way to start and we can take our time finding the right finca in the campo. We also prefer to be car less and use public trains, buses and bikes mostly and just rent a car for short periods when needed.That might not be possible with a rural property, but very easy here.
    
      
    
    We are just a few meters from the main blue flag beach in town, major grocery store ( Spars), a park, library, clinic, restaurants, recycle bins,   and stores. The stone and paved promenade along side the beach runs about 5 miles from end to end.  This complex has a place to store  our bikes in the lobby and ramp to the outside door. This town and Delta area is flat enough to be ideal for biking. There is a wonderful small expat community here ( English, Dutch, Irish, French,  All of these things and more make it a perfect place to grow old and long term investment to pass on to our daughter.
    
      
    
     We have stairs in this building as well as an elevator. The large rooftop has spectacular views and perfect for watching fireworks during holidays and hanging up clothes to dry. Perhaps in the future I will create a roof top garden and outdoor movie theatre.
    
      
    
    We fell in love with this magical little fishing village on our first visit. We loved the peaceful vibe, beaches, enchanting olive tree farms, small yacht harbor, flowers and ambiance. There is a wonderful small expat community here ( English, Irish, Dutch, French, Swiss, Belgium & a few Americans) and friendly locals. We’ve become good friends with an American who moved here in 2016 with his husband & owns a restaurant so close to this apartment with some of the best food in Spain!  All of these things and more make it a perfect place to grow old, do exchanges and a long term investment to pass on to our daughter.
    
      
    
    The old couple who lived here before us had this place for 23 years, but live in Tortosa so just used it for a few weeks in the summer. Although there are many beach view apartments and homes here, this is the ideal spot, thus they rarely are available. Many of the sea view apartments and homes are second homes, so mostly used in summer and rarely sold. 
    

- We are just painting it all white right now and will live here a while to decide what else we might want to do. Luckily, we already have a great local architect and the friendly president of the homeowners association is a construction expert who lives here and is redoing a few of the apartments in this building he owns. He is  already helping us with a few small things.  
    
    We just closed the deal and moved in two weeks ago, but fall more in love with it every day. It all feels so right and we are grateful that we did NOT get any of the other  homes we were interested in now. Also we are so grateful for all we learned in this process. Each home taught us something. We will start blogging about the good, bad and ugly of house hunting in Spain. It is not really too hard once you realize it is just done differently.
    
      
    
    Most foreigners usually buy homes with cash. Mortgages are possible, but much trickier, even more so with older buyers.. Prices over all are much cheaper than California and many places in the USA ( and expensive places in Europe). High end cities like Madrid and Barcelona of course will be higher priced than small coastal towns or inland villages.
    
      
    
    Houses often or usually stay on the market for years without lowering prices. One can bargain. The paper work can be immense ( more so with rural properties). Real estate agents in Spain do not have training like USA realtors. Plus you can not really sue like USA if you are ripped off. Thus it is really important to also use a trust worthy, experienced  lawyer and architect when buying in Spain. We will be writing about who we chose and why.
    
      
    
    We will be getting a retirement visa for Spain soon. After much thought and research, we think Spain is an ideal place to retire. Are you looking to move to Spain or retire here? What questions would you like us to answer for you?

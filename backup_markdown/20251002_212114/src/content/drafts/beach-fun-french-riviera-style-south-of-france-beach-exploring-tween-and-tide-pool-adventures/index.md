Family travel in the [south of France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html#tp) means not missing the fun of perfect beach days and the idyllic summer memories that they create.  We're not into slathering with oil and tanning, so  prefer uncrowded beaches and our 9 year old Mozart had so much fun at this private beach that was part of our campsite near Coullier called  [Les Criques de Porteils](http://www.lescriques.com/).

There are plenty of sandy beaches in this area, but she liked this one because she could snorkel, had more privacy for that "[Swiss Family Robinson"](http://www.amazon.com/Swiss-Family-Robinson-Disney-Collection/dp/B00005RRG7/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1280827345&sr=1-1) or "[Swallows and Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Swallows-Amazons-Godine-Storyteller-Ransome/dp/087923573X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1280827395&sr=1-1)s" adventurous atmosphere and she adored catching little crabs in their shells. We'd go late in the day to avoid the sun and wait until most people left the beach.

She easily caught over one hundred crabs one day and glowed with excitement as she showed them to me in her bucket. She also collected rocks and shells and met a few friends there although none spoke the same language. Most were French here but she also met a little Dutch girl about her age. It seems this kind of exploring, rock jumping and collecting in tide pools is a universal joy for kids of a certain age. A good healthy learning time with that tween sense of endless summer adventure made famous like the books above or in series like " [The Box Car Children "](http://www.amazon.com/Boxcar-Children-Books-1-4/dp/0807508543/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1280827572&sr=1-2) and "[Tom Sawyer".](http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Sawyer-Mark-Twain-Library/dp/0520266129/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1280827660&sr=1-1)

Sometimes we add time to our [family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/04/how-to-travel-the-world-as-a-digital-nomad-family.html#tp) just for these little moments. Days of important play. We shift our [travel homeschooling to enhance the learning](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html#tp). Lets find out what kind of crabs, shells, rocks that they are. [Travel and education or unschooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/04/family-travel-homeschool-education-global-students-lifestyle-design-location-independent-4hww-around.html#tp) are a natural mix.

She already had the blow up pink tube, googles and snorkel, but we succumbed to adding the pink water shoes which are de rigueur for this kind of beach terrain. Beach days are part of the joy of family travel and not to be missed on the French Riviera. What sublime simple pleasures are you enjoying this summer?

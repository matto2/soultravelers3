Who wouldn't want to walk in the footsteps of the Master Painters? The South of France is a heady mix of art, exquisite restaurants, beaches, hiking, wine, Roman remains, sunshine and a perfect place to learn by doing. Since all three of us are artists who [love Van Gogh](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/van-gogh.html "van gogh") and [the Impressionists](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/3-museums-in-a.html "the impressionists in Europe"), it was a thrill to follow his footsteps and visit the places he painted [while in Arles](http://soultravelers3new.local/2012/04/arles-france-vacation.html "visiting arles france").  
  
It is quite amazing how little it has changed and even gave our young daughter lessons in art that we could not teach any other way. Another example of [world schooling](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/03/long-term-family-travel-homeschool-roadschool-world-school-digitalnomad-lifestyle-design-virtual-.html "world schooling") at it's best and how travel teaches. Also in the [South of France](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-southern-france-uzes-provence-near-pont-du-gard-photography-europe-window.html "south of france") we enjoyed walking the artists foodsteps in c[apitvating Colliore](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/07/colliore-france-on-bastille-day-family-travel-pyrennees-catalonia-beautiful-village-on-the-med-sea.html "captivating Colliore beautiful french town")  , [Roman art in Nimes](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/08/beautiful-photo-of-nimes-france-.html "roman art in Nimes")  and [Pont du Gard](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/09/swimming-canoeing-at-pont-du-gard-france-family-travel-adventures-family-friendly-camping-.html "Pont du gard, france ")  and more.

<!--more--> Yes, it is VERY common as kids get to this age, to prefer to speak the dominant language. My trilingual child is 12 now, so we have been through this phase.  
  
What I discovered is children who got enough time hearing/using the 2nd language and always had to answer back in that language to the parent speaking it had a MUCH greater chance of becoming bilingual than children who did not.  
  
My own brother failed to raise his child as a bilingual even though they tried and the mother is a native speaker of the minority language and her parents don't speak much English and they spent a LOT of time visiting that country and having them visit.  
  
The now grown child has some recessive understanding of the minority language, but very little and wishes she was fluent.  
  
I have seen case after case like this.  
  
We are monolingual parents so I understand the challenge of getting the minority language into the child.  
  
I would look for every possible opportunity to find other Spanish speaking opportunities for your child, I wrote a series about how to raise a multilingual child and included some of the things that worked for us:

I would also consider taking some immersion vacations where Spanish is the dominant language. When a child understands the value of the 2nd language it helps greatly.  
  
In my experience, raising a bilingual or multilingual child doesn't just happen without a LOT of consistent daily work for many years.  
  
A child who is bilingual at 2 will not necessarily be bilingual at 12 or 20....so one has to find ways around the normal human tendency to want to just talk the easiest dominant language.  
  
Having your husband as the OPOC speaker adds challenges, but it can be done and luckily Spanish is a very easy languge to supplement in the USA with MANY native speakers and communities around.  
  
Even though I don't speak Spanish, I spent most of my babies early years in Spanish only environments in USA. with native speakers..lonely at times for me. but worked well for her!

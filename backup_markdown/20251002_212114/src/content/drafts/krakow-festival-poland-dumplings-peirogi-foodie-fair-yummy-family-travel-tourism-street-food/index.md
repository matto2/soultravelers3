Krakow Festival

<!--more-->

  
 What luck! Nothing like a local festival to add some excitement to family travel! We arrived on a Wednesday and had explored much of beautiful Krakow, so we were delighted to hear traditional music wafting into our hotel room on Friday morning. We looked out our window could see it all, so decided to go down and take a closer look.  
  
Our recent excursion into Poland just happened to land us there on one of their biggest holiday weekends, where they were celebrating the joys of  peirogi , which are their famous dumplings! Yum! We had no idea that they would be celebrating this during mid August, but were more than happy to join in with the locals. We had been admiring the colorful traditional costumes, so were glad to see more of them and some folk dancing too.  
  
Quite by chance, I found out through twitter, that XXX does culinary tours including this "Festiwal Pierogo in Krakow. Someone else had said she was enjoying both of our "live"  tweets and twitpics of this event. We had already tried some absolutely divine mushroom and cabbage peirogi at the beautiful restaurant XXX which had won the prize for best dumplings in Krakow three years in a row, so knew we loved this Polish specialty and very open to trying more.  
  
The salmon peirogi we tasted at the festival was delicious and quite different, but even that came in second to those we tried at XXX. We went from booth to booth over the entire weekend trying all the various dumplings and specialities  since it was in the small square right by our hotel and cost less than .50 euro each. All were delicious, but none could compare to the ones we ate at XXX.  
  
They also had waffles with whip creme and what ever topping that you wanted, which made Mozart very happy. She ended up with that for desert for two days in a row although she also really enjoyed the apple and blueberry filled dumplings that were topped with a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

[Family travel](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/05/top-10-family-t.html?cid=116576936) is about seeing spectacular performances sometimes by icons that we have long admired. We were thrilled when we went to the [Arena coliseum](http://soultravelers3new.local/2010/06/family-travel-italy-verona-farm-stay-agritourismo-romeo-juliet-arena-opera.html) in [Verona, Italy](http://soultravelers3new.local/2008/02/romeo-juliet-in.html) and saw this exquisite version of the [opera Carmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen), that was directed by [Placido Domingo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%A1cido_Domingo) and the set design was by [Franco Zeffirelli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Zeffirelli) . I've long been a huge fan of Franco Zeffereli and through a dear friend, I happened to attend Placido Domingo's 50th birthday party long ago in New York City.  
  
We were in Verona in high season last August and we did not book ahead, so it was all by chance, similar to our great luck at the [famous Globe Theatre in London](http://soultravelers3new.local/2009/07/family-travel-photoengland-globe-theatre-king-lear.html). As I have said before, one should not miss an opera in Verona in this ancient coliseum even if you do not like opera. It is a spectacular experience and as you can see the Zefferelli sets were amazing even from our very cheap seats with the locals under the moonlight. Our 8 year old loved it and so did we!

Have you seen Carmen or been to the Arena in Verona?

He had sandy blond hair and those telltale  eight-year-old's missing teeth and the cutest  grin, so we all soon fell for adorable Joel ( pronounced the European way with the accent on the second syllable like noel).He saw us at dinner in the restaurant of our [campsite](http://www.lariviereleseyzies.com/) and asked us if we spoke English. He must have heard us speaking, which made him very happy, as it was one of his 3 languages and French ( which most of the kids were speaking) was not.

His father seemed to speak  French and was also very nice. People are what makes a place interesting and meeting these two was a fun part of our stay in the [Dordogne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dordogne). They were on a camping trip together, just the two guys. Joel's mother was from [Andalusia, Spain](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/11/andalusia.html) and they all lived in the [Netherlands](http://soultravelers3new.local/2006/09/more-edam.html) where the father was from. The common language for the parents was English, so that is what they spoke in the home, thus Joel and Mozart shared two languages ( Spanish and English).

He and Mozart seemed to become instant best friends. When ever we were not touring and they were not touring, the two of them would be playing. We got used to the little knock at our door every morning and Joel's cute face and greeting.  Within seconds they were off running around the campsite.

These special friends that we meet on the road are a big part of the fun. One of the [great things about camping](http://www.transitionsabroad.com/publications/magazine/0411/motor_homing_in_europe.shtml) is it is such an easy way to meet other families [from all over Europe](http://www.karmabum.com/).This family comes to Andalusia from time to time, so maybe we will meet again! Waving to you Joel and sending you hugs across the cyber wires and miles. Thanks for sharing your sweetness and fun with us!

# WordPress to Astro Migration Project

## Tech Stack Requirements

- Astro (NOT React) - use .astro components only
- TypeScript where applicable
- Tailwind CSS 4 (latest) - DO NOT suggest old Tailwind configs or v3 syntax
- Content Collections for blog posts, pages, custom content
- R2 for image hosting

## Key Guidelines

- This is an ASTRO project - no React components unless absolutely necessary
- Use Astro's component syntax (.astro files)
- When adding Tailwind, use the latest v4 configuration
- Maintain WordPress URL structure where possible for SEO
- All images should reference R2 URLs, not local files

## Performance Focus

- Prioritize fast loading times (proving Astro > WordPress performance)
- Minimize bundle size
- Use Astro's partial hydration strategically
- Use Astro's dev server, not external build tools

## SEO Preservation

- Maintain meta descriptions, titles from WordPress frontmatter
- Keep similar URL slugs for existing content
- Generate proper sitemaps

## Content Handling

- Preserve all WordPress shortcodes/embeds (YouTube iframes, etc.)
- Handle WordPress HTML cleanup in markdown
- Maintain category/tag relationships

## Client Considerations

- Document any changes for easy client review
- Make content editing straightforward
- Avoid over-engineering since this is a proof of concept
- Keep the build process simple for client handoff

## Current Issues to Fix

- Content collection schema validation errors (date vs pubDate fields)
- Image URLs need bulk replacement from WordPress to R2 format
- Need proper routing for pages and custom post types

## What NOT to do

- Don't suggest React solutions
- Don't give me Tailwind v3 configuration
- Don't break existing content structure
- Don't suggest complex build processes
